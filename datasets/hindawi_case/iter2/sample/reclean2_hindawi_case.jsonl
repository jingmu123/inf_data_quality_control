The syndrome is characterized by cognitive impairment, encephalopathy, psychiatric symptoms, and seizures associated with increased level of anti-thyroid antibodies. The exact pathophysiology underlying cerebral involvement is still lesser known. Although symptoms suggest a nonlesional encephalopathy in most of the cases, sometimes the clinical appearance can be subtle and may not respond to immunosuppressants or immunomodulatory agents. Here we report a case who presented with drowsiness and amnestic complaints associated with paroxysmal electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities which could be treated only with an antiepileptic drug.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hashimoto’s encephalopathy (HE) has been acknowledged as a syndrome of altered mental status varying between delusional thinking, confusion, and hallucinations with the presence of increased serum levels of anti-thyroid antibodies. Epileptic seizures may accompany these symptoms. The syndrome was first described by Brain and colleagues as a case report in 1966 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. HE syndrome can be acute and fulminant or chronic as in dementia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Ataxia, tremor, myoclonus, focal neurologic deficit, and some psychiatric symptoms including depression, manic state, and psychosis in severe forms can be observed in this syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. HE is relatively rare and still lesser known. Here we present a patient with paroxysmal memory impairment attacks and loss of attention. Here we report and discuss clinical, electroencephalographic (EEG), and neuroimaging findings of a HE syndrome by highlighting diagnostic and treatment features.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 52-year-old woman suffering with drowsiness and memory problems was admitted to our hospital’s neurology department. She complained about disremembering some parts of a day and what she had done. These attacks were lasting for a few minutes to one hour sometimes and repeating every day in last three months. She had no history of psychiatric disease, epilepsy, or other mental problems including dementia. Neurologic examination did not reveal any focal abnormalities. Extended laboratory findings including CBC, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, vitamin B12, folate, electrolytes, blood ammonia, and glucose levels were normal. Thyroid function tests including free T3, free T4, and TSH were normal. Her mini mental state examination test score was within the normal range for her age and education level (29/30). Neither a noncontrast cranial computerized tomography  nor the T1-weighted images of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormalities like calcification. T1-weighted images after intravenous gadolinium administration were unremarkable. No evidence of cytotoxic edema was present on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2 weighted images demonstrated bilaterally symmetric basal ganglia hyperintensity . On EEG, the background activity was mildly slow and irregular . An interictal EEG recording showed bilateral paroxysms of rudimentary spike and sharp wave discharges . Mini mental state examination test score was 27. To explain the etiology of subacute encephalopathy we examined her autoimmune markers. Serum anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and ENA panel tests were negative. Anti-thyroid antibodies were elevated. Anti-TPO was 1258 U/mL and the anti-TG antibody was 154. In the light of clinic and laboratory findings she was diagnosed as HE. Intravenous methylprednisolone treatment with a dose of 1000 mg per day was initiated and maintained orally 60 mg per day. Control EEG on the 14th day of the treatment showed a normal background activity. Her attention and drowsiness were also improved. However the paroxysms of sharp waves on EEG persisted and she was still complaining about amnesia attacks. The patient was given orally levetiracetam with a dose of 1000 mg per day. On follow-up she was symptom free and her control EEG recording was normal.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Noncontrast CT scan is normal (a) and FLAIR 通用删除1(英):<u>(fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)</u> images demonstrate increased T2 signal activity at bilateral lentiform and caudate nucleus (b-c).</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 EEG showing the presence of slow and irregular background (a) and bilateral sharp wave paroxysms (b).</u>\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can cause an autoimmune encephalopathy with an unknown pathophysiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The clinic presentation of this rarely seen syndrome is variable including psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairments, seizures, and hemispheric neurologic deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Patients with HE can be euthyroid as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. An extended diagnostic procedure for vascular, toxic, metabolic, and infectious diseases should be performed carefully to avoid other etiologies which are not caused by thyroid dysfunctions such as autoimmune encephalopathy, infections of central nervous system, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, and CNS angiitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【10】The most common cranial MRI changes in this syndrome include bilateral subcortical high signal lesions and bilateral hippocampus or thalamic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, as in a recently reported case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> our patients MRI showed bilaterally, symmetrical basal ganglia hyperintensity without any mass effect, cytotoxic edema, and calcification.\n\n【11】Our case is a patient who presented with drowsiness, loss of attention, and paroxysmal memory impairment attacks associated with symmetric slowing background activity and bilateral paroxysms of sharp wave discharges on EEG. It is well known that HE may be associated with mental and cognitive dysfunctions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In a recent study, Wang et al. showed that the impairments in cognitive functions for patients with HE are similar to those with Alzheimer’s disease patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Epileptic seizures can also be seen in HE. The most frequent seizure types contain generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and complex partial seizures often associated with an EEG showing diffuse slowing background activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The syndrome can cause status epilepticus rarely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. In HE, steroid therapy has shown to be associated with improvement or resolution of EEG findings. However, in our patient even though the slow background activity on EEG was improved after steroid therapy, the paroxysmal slow-wave discharges persisted until levetiracetam was initiated as an antiepileptic drug. Similar to our case, in two cases recently reported by Wang et al, levetiracetam was found to be effective in treatment of HE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【12】It is important to recognize this syndrome which is usually treatable successfully with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents such as IVIG, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and azathioprine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Nevertheless, as in our case steroid therapy may not always be able to treat both clinic and electrophysiologic symptoms. Therefore appropriate antiepileptic medication should be administered.\n\n【13】HE should be considered especially in patients with encephalopathy with an unexplained etiology. But our case demonstrated that HE symptoms can be subtle. On such an occasion, the clinicians should suspect the presence of HE and evaluate anti-thyroid antibodies. But we thought that emphasis must be given to EEG which is valuable in evaluation of neurological conditions either associated with or apart from epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. As in our case, in patients with impaired consciousness or altered mental state EEG is important in diagnosing and monitoring the whole treatment process.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:42:28", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:43:35", "cost": 67.251}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:43:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:42:26"}

Clinical features are heterogeneous and include fever, respiratory compromise, mucocutaneous involvement with conjunctival abnormalities and erythematous exanthem, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Neurologic and cardiovascular symptoms can also develop, including coronary artery dilatation. Some cases involve 2 or more organs and require critical admission. Echocardiography is the mainstay of cardiac evaluation in the acute setting as well as on outpatient follow-up. We present the case of a 4-month-old female with no past medical or surgical history who presented with a prolonged febrile syndrome associated with severe respiratory illness, gastrointestinal symptoms, and mucocutaneous abnormalities. Diagnosis of MIS-C was established based on clinical findings, persistently elevated markers of systemic inflammation and positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test and evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Echocardiogram evidenced myopericarditis and coronary aneurysms and patient was deemed candidate for immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), resulting in favorable clinical and paraclinical outcomes. Few cases of giant coronary aneurysms have been reported in children. There are no existing literature reports about coronary thrombosis or thrombus formation resulting from vascular aneurysmal dilations in this population. As such, the prognosis and natural history of coronary artery aneurysms in the setting of MIS-C remain largely unknown.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】COVID-19, initially known as a cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome, has represented a major challenge for those working in pediatric healthcare, where a great diversity of clinical manifestations has been documented. During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first observational studies showed that most children were asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> or were not severely affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】However, in the United Kingdom in April 2020, a potentially fatal hyperinflammatory condition was first described. This condition shared clinical characteristics with incomplete Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome, consistent of a febrile syndrome associated with mucocutaneous involvement, polymorphic rash, edema and erythema on palms and soles, coronary involvement, and elevation of inflammatory markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. This condition called Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) is recognized as a complication that generally develops 4 to 6 weeks after infection by SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, a situation suggesting that the virus may be a trigger for genetically predisposed individuals. 53–80% of them did not show positivity in the polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR), but the vast majority, from 75% to 90%, had serological positivity IgG or an epidemiological link with the infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The overall proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with MIS-C is largely unknown. Most patients do not have past medical conditions and the mean age of presentation is around 8 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Its clinical manifestations include fever, respiratory involvement in 30–70%, mucocutaneous involvement in 74%, conjunctival changes in 45–54%, erythematous rash in 52–62%, in addition, gastrointestinal manifestations such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea in 53–92%, neurological and cardiovascular symptoms in 80%. 71–90% of patients presented involvement of more than 2 organs and half of the patients require admission to the intensive care unit during their hospital stay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Cardiac complications are significant, with more than 80% of patients presenting cardiac involvement and around 10% to 40% of cases developing alterations in the coronary arteries. Among those most documented include coronary hyperechogenicity and with a lower incidence, true coronary aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u> which if not timely treated, could lead to fatal outcomes. Coronary artery aneurysm is a rare clinical entity defined by an abnormal focal dilatation of a coronary artery exceeding the adjacent normal segment in diameter by at least 1.5-fold 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The size threshold for a small aneurysm is defined by Z score ≥2.5 to <5, medium aneurysm with a Z score ≥5 to <10, and a giant aneurysm with a Z score ≥10 or ≥8 mm in diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Echocardiography is the cornerstone for evaluation of cardiac involvement in the acute phase and during follow-up. The most common findings include left ventricular dysfunction and abnormalities in coronary arteries including dilatation. Reports of giant aneurysmal alterations are not common and to date there is no information on the presence of thrombi in coronary dilatations developed in association with this condition.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Clinical Case\n\n【9】A 4-month-old female patient presented with fever. She had no significant clinical history, weighing 8 kg (ideal 6.9 kg), height 64 cm, cephalic circumference 41 cm, BMI 19.5 and nutritional classification: P/T Z score: 1.65 Overweight risk, T/E Z score: 0.05 appropriate, BMI Z score: 1.63 Overweight risk, PC Z score: -0.31 Normal. She was admitted with a prolonged febrile syndrome of 15 days, associated with severe respiratory symptoms, liquid stools, and nonpurulent bilateral conjunctival injection. Given persistence of fever, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR), and a positive molecular test for SARS-CoV-2, further laboratory analyses were significant for leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, elevated D-dimer, elevated pro-BNP, and evidence of previous infection as indicated by positive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 . As an epidemiologic link to SARS-CoV-2 infection, she had contact with her grandfather who died from COVID-19. During physical examination, she had sustained tachycardia as a sign of low output, no hypotension, and appropriate respiratory pattern without requiring ventilator or vasoactive support, without neurological involvement.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Lab tests.</u>\n\n【11】Clinical and laboratory findings met WHO criteria for MIS-C. Despite the timeframe of the febrile condition and considering the laboratory findings, immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous (2 g/kg) was indicated along with aspirin (ASA) in anti-inflammatory dosage (50 mg/kg) in addition to anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (1 mg/kg) according to the recommendations described in the literature to date. A first echocardiogram demonstrated appropriate left ventricular contractility, with myopericarditis and aneurysmal dilatations of the left and right coronary arteries . Electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation in three continuous leads, a pattern suggestive of myocarditis.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Echocardiograms.</u>\n\n【13】Two days after starting immunomodulation with IVIG, the fever resolved, so corticosteroid treatment was not deemed necessary. She presented an appropriate clinical response, was discharged from the PICU 10 days later, and was discharged from the hospital 11 days after admission with anticoagulant therapy that she was already receiving in the hospital (1 mg/kg) and ASA in antiplatelet dose; she still receives treatment to date.T\n\n【14】Echocardiograms performed during follow-up showed dilatation of the left cardiac chambers and persistence of aneurysmal dilatations. This led to a cardiac catheterization carried out 7 months after the onset of the inflammatory condition. A finding of an aneurysm in the middle third of the right coronary artery was described, measuring 9.43 mm × 5.8 mm with an image of intracoronary thrombus occupying 2/3 of the aneurysmal lumen. There was also evidence of an aneurysm in the circumflex artery, measuring 5.9 mm × 5.3 mm without evidence of thrombus .\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Cardiac catheterization: Aneurysm in the middle third of the right coronary artery, measuring 9.43 mm × 5.8 mm with an image of intracoronary thrombus occupying 2/3 of the aneurysmal lumen.</u>\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Cardiac catheterization: Aneurysm in the right coronary artery, with an image of intracoronary thrombus.</u>\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Cardiac catheterization: Intracoronary thrombus occupying 2/3 of the aneurysmal lumen in the middle third of the right coronary artery.</u>\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Cardiac catheterization: Aneurysm in the circumflex artery, measuring 5.9 mm × 5.3 mm without evidence of thrombus.</u>\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Disscusion\n\n【20】MIS-C is a severe clinical condition with significant cardiac implications that occurs as a consequence of a dysregulated inflammatory response. It typically develops several weeks after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a reported mortality of around 2% in high-income countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. In contrast, data from developing countries such as Colombia report mortality rates of 9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The incidence of cardiac biomarker elevation such as pro-BNP and troponin is 86.65% and 76.34%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, on some occasions with extremely high levels as was with our current case, correlating with severe myocardial damage comparable to that from Kawasaki disease (KD). Significantly elevated levels of ferritin, procalcitonin, and D-dimer have also been documented, as in the case described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Echocardiography has great diagnostic value when evaluating cardiovascular involvement. The main documented findings have been coronary artery dilatation by 17.83%, aneurysm by 6.85%, pericarditis by 20.97%, myocarditis by 35.97%, and myocardial dysfunction up to 68% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 12\\]</u>. Most of the described complications related to dilatation and coronary aneurysm are small with a Z score of 2–2.5, contrary to the case presented in which giant aneurysmal dilatations were found. This could probably be explained by young age, as with growth comes improved mechanical resistance of the internal elastic lamina to aneurysm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Although infrequent, 3 cases described in Atlanta (Georgia) reported giant aneurysms occurring in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, however, so far there are no reports of aneurysmal thrombus formation. Despite the important presentation of MIS-C cases described, there are no national or Latin American publications about the findings of giant aneurysms, nor their evolution or complications.\n\n【23】Echocardiography plays an important role during longitudinal surveillance after MIS-C. Studies suggest that in patients with abnormal findings such as dilatations or aneurysms, it is necessary to carry out rigorous imaging monitoring, which in this case was not possible due to the difficulties with access to healthcare. The last outpatient echocardiogram report (8 months after the presentation of this hyperinflammatory syndrome) showed persistence of giant aneurysms in the right and circumflex coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The main purpose of treatment in MIS-C is to reduce systemic inflammation to protect affected organs and reduce or prevent complications such as coronary aneurysms and death. This treatment is guided according to the clinical presentation and requires a multidisciplinary team (cardiology, infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology, and intensive care). To date, there are no randomized controlled clinical trials or comparative efficacy studies evaluating treatment strategies. This is why available guidelines are based on expert opinion, scientific societies, and previous experience with Kawasaki disease and other multisystemic disorders in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Immunomodulatory management with immunoglobulins continues to be the first choice, and has been prescribed as monotherapy or in conjunction with corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Other important interventions include administration of ASA in 58–74% of cases and anticoagulant management in 37–44%, based on the presence of serum markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The prognosis and natural history of coronary aneurysms associated with MIS-C are still uncertain. To date, reports show that even the subset patients with MIS-C requiring critical admission and/or those with severe cardiovascular involvement, recovery was seen without sequelae in 70–95% of cases. The prognostic impact on outcomes of those cases with aneurysmal thrombosis is not known, as this severe clinical presentation remains largely undescribed. This clinical entity requires further study and structured long-term follow-up due to the risk of progression of cardiac manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It has been established that in Kawasaki disease the risk of presenting thrombotic or stenotic complications is related to the size of the aneurysms; giant aneurysms (Z score ≥10) are the least likely to undergo resolution, and are associated with up to 50% risk of adverse outcomes such as thrombotic coronary occlusion, progressive stenosis requiring revascularization, or acute coronary syndrome within 30 years after the initial illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This highlights the importance of guaranteeing rigorous follow-up in order to anticipate early complications and carry out timely interventions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:50:44", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:51:06", "cost": 22.367}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:51:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:50:43"}

It is a benign disease that might mimic a neoplastic process. It primarily affects the head and neck region, presenting as deep subcutaneous masses, and is often accompanied by triad regional lymphadenopathy, salivary gland involvement, and high serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Here, we report the second documented case of KD in Palestine diagnosed in a 28-year-old male patient who presented with lymphadenopathy and increased serum immunoglobulin E and G (IgE and IgG) associated with intermittent abdominal pain, generalised fatigue, hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy, reactive airway disease, peripheral vasculopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The patient was managed with steroids and an immunosuppressant (Azathioprine) with a moderate response for two years. In 2021, treatment with Mycophenolate Mofetil was initiated, which was more effective than Azathioprine.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 28-year-old male patient, a heavy smoker with a body mass index of 24.8, with a history of hepatitis A 3 months before admission, and asthma since the age of 19, was admitted with one week of colicky periumbilical pain radiating to the lower abdomen and upper thighs. The pain gradually increased in intensity and was associated with distension, general fatigue, a fever of 39.1°C, anorexia, and unintentional weight loss (around 10 kg in one month). Also, he reported shortness of breath, lower limb swelling, and upper back and bilateral hand numbness that progressed to severe pain. There were no reports of trauma, heartburn, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, melena, or haematochezia.\n\n【7】The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit at the age of 19 with exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and lower limb oedema, according to his medical history. A diagnosis of pneumonia with atelectasis and delirium was made. He also had a history of diffuse nasal polyposis, grade 4, as well as an allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and penicillin. Additionally, at the age of 2, he underwent adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy procedures.\n\n【8】Chest examination revealed barrel shape, diminished expansion and faint wheezes. Additionally, hepatomegaly with a 20 cm liver span in the midclavicular line was found and confirmed by an ultrasound study. Both inguinal and cervical lymph nodes were palpable, bilaterally firm, rounded, nontender, and 1 to 2 cm each in size. Over the abdomen, audible bowel gurgling sounds were heard. Moreover, marked bilateral exophthalmos  and bilateral Raynaud’s hands with bluish discolouration were observed . His right radial pulse was absent, whereas the left radial pulse was weak. On the other hand, the examination of the lower limbs was normal, and no discrepancies between arm and leg blood pressure were found.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Marked bilateral exophthalmos.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Bilateral Raynaud’s hands, with marked bluish discoloration of the fingers and nails.</u>\n\n【11】Laboratory tests revealed anaemia and elevated levels of IgE and IgG, inflammatory markers, and the creatinine level. In addition, rheumatoid factor and antismooth muscle antibodies were positive . However, electrolyte levels, liver enzymes, a thyroid function test, serological analysis, thrombophilia studies, an albumin blood test, and tumour biomarkers (PSA, CEA, and AFP) were all normal.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory tests that were conducted as a part of the investigation.</u>\n\n【13】A computed tomography (CT) Pan-Scan showed mild bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular opacification. Hepatomegaly with an inhomogeneous mottled pattern of contrast enhancement was seen. Para-aortic, mediastinal, and hilar LNs were small, none exceeding 6 mm multiple small inguinal LNs were noted, none over 12 mm. Sinus CT without contrast revealed a paranasal sinus mucocele.\n\n【14】Three months after admission, laboratory tests showed 3+ proteinuria and 1.2 mg/dL creatinine. An echocardiogram revealed dilated left ventricle (6 cm), reduced systolic function, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated chambers, and moderate aortic regurgitation (interventricular septum thickness 1.2 cm, EF = 40%). As a result, heart failure therapy (enalapril, spironolactone, and carvedilol) was initiated.\n\n【15】An inguinal LN biopsy showed lymphoid follicles an increased number of eosinophils surrounding dilated and hyalinised blood vessels. No evidence of malignancy was found. Features were mostly consistent with Kimura’s disease. A biopsy of the bone marrow revealed normocellular bone marrow with a granulomatous reaction and eosinophilic infiltration. The kidney biopsy revealed glomerular segmental sclerosis, and a diagnosis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was made. Therefore, moderate-dose steroids (tapered within a few weeks) and Azathioprine were added to his medications regimen.\n\n【16】Contrary to medical advice, he has been off medication throughout 2019. He developed a right round, firm, and nontender lump in his neck. The US revealed approximately 7 × 7 mm LN, located in the middle of the left lateral aspect of the neck with loss of the hilum, and a left submandibular gland of coarse echotexture . He also experienced paraesthesia in the right arm and right leg; electromyography indicated right tibial nerve axonal neuropathy. Moreover, he had several white, well-defined, and painless tongue ulcers  that were persistent over a year, oval in shape, less than 1 cm in size, more than 14 in number, and distributed along the anteromedial and the anterolateral portions of the ventral aspect of the tongue.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Neck ultrasound of the left lateral aspect of the neck shows a 7 × 7 mm rounded lymph node, with loss of fatty hilum, located medially to the internal jugular vein.</u>\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Neck ultrasound of both submandibular glands which shows left submandibular gland coarse echotexture, normal size, and vascularity.</u>\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Ventral white tongue ulcers.</u>\n\n【20】A year later, Mycophenolate Mofetil was started in place of Azathioprine since it was more effective in suppressing the disease and reducing GI distress. The patient’s most recent examination revealed improved symptoms of asthma and cardiomyopathy. His last echo revealed normal LV size and function (nearly 55% ejection fraction), and serum IgG and IgE levels were within the normal range.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】This is the second case of KD reported in Palestine. The patient manifested rare and atypical symptoms as he developed multiple systemic manifestations, including renal, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological involvement. KD is a benign chronic inflammatory rare disease that is more common in males and Asians. It usually presents as subcutaneous nodules at the head and neck region, and lymph node enlargement. Patients with KD usually have high IgE levels and eosinophilia, which suggests shared pathological and genetic pathways with other immunological diseases such as asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, which this patient also has. However, the combination of systemic symptoms observed in this case is typically absent in KD.\n\n【23】Several factors were suggested to have a role in the pathogenesis of KD, including neoplasms, insect bites, candida infection, immune dysregulation, and genetic risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Ohta et al. indicated that the levels of Th2 and Tc1 cells were higher in KD patients compared to controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The overproduction of Th2 cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), eotaxin, and RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed, and Secreted), trigger the production of the lymphoid follicle and high IgE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. Therefore, immunohistochemistry is essential for diagnosis and excluding alternative diagnoses.\n\n【24】Many KD patients also suffer from asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and chronic urticaria, which suggest shared immunological pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Liu et al. indicated that patients with KD may have a genetic predisposition towards allergies. Persistent or interrupted exposure to a known or unknown allergen could trigger the occurrence of KD by the antigen-presenting cells that promote the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th2 cells during T cell priming. Thus, elevated IgE and abundant eosinophils with mast cells and basophils result in type 1 hypersensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Using the OMIM and GeneCards databases, Chen et al. found that genes linked to autoimmune diseases, such as ARPC1B, NOD2, BANK1, and CIITA, may be related to the susceptibility to KD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Volpi et al. analysed 14 patients with biallelic ARPC1B mutations and reported combined immunodeficiency, allergy, and autoinflammation as a result of the mutations. Clinical symptoms reported in these patients involved platelet abnormalities, eosinophilia, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, and combined immunodeficiency. Moreover, abnormal immunoglobulin levels were observed in vivo, with markedly elevated IgA and IgE in almost all cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, suggesting that ARPC1B mutations are associated with immunologic derangement or autoimmune disease, which may be associated with a predisposition to KD. However, genetic mutations associated with KD susceptibility remain unclear, and further investigations are required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Chen et al. compiled that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Behcet’s disease (BD), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy (MN), mesangioproliferative disease, IgA nephropathy, and IgG4-related diseases (IgG4-RD) have been reported to have KD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 16\\]</u>. Moreover, they highlighted the numerous reports of the co-occurrence of KD and IgG4-RD, which demonstrates that KD is more prevalent in individuals with autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Therefore, histopathological and immunohistochemistry evaluations are necessary to distinguish KD from other similar conditions. Typical histological features of Kimura’s disease in lymph nodes include germinal centre hyperplasia, increased postcapillary venules in the mantle zones, vascularization of germinal centres, eosinophilic infiltration in the sinuses and paracortex occurring later in germinal centres, paracortical eosinophilic abscesses, and sclerosis of variable degrees 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The pathological findings must be interpreted in combination with the clinical, serologic, and radiographic data.\n\n【28】It is important to rule out other inflammatory and malignant diseases with similar clinical presentation and pathological features. KD and Hodgkin Lymphoma, for instance, share pathological characteristics, including intact LN architecture, florid germinal centre hyperplasia, extensive eosinophilic infiltrates, and proliferation of postcapillary venules. Even though the presence of Reed-Sternberg is considered a diagnosis for Hodgkin Lymphoma, it may not be detected initially, which makes a diagnostic challenge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【29】The differential diagnosis of KD is quite broad, including IgG4-RD, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE), Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Castleman’s disease, lymphadenopathy of drug reaction, parasitic lymphadenopathy, and others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The top on the differentials list is ALHE disease. Clinically, both diseases have soft tissue masses, especially in the head and neck region, with a prolonged clinical course and tendency to recur. They share a similar vascular nature of the lesion with lymphoid and eosinophilic infiltrates, and both have a good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【30】But there are some differences: KD usually affects younger people in the second or third decades, more commonly in males and Asian people, and is almost always accompanied by peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 19\\]</u>. Our case showed an elevated IgE level (more than 4000). On the other hand, ALHE appears in all ages, with a peak incidence in patients who are 30–50 years old (mean age of 38 years); 6% of cases appear in children, and there is no gender predilection. It has been reported most frequently and similarly in Asians and whites, with less than 5% of reported cases in blacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. ALHE causes cutaneous papules and nodules and is less commonly associated with eosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【31】In addition, KD and ALHE manifestations on the tongue and the oral mucosa are rare. In the latter, tongue ulcers are approximately 10 mm in diameter, while KD oral ulcers tend to be larger, about 30 mm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. In our case, the patient developed multiple ventral tongue ulcers that persisted for over a year, which could be a manifestation of KD.\n\n【32】However, KD and ALHE can rarely affect the orbit and the ocular adnexa. They can cause proptosis, lid swelling, ocular dysmotility, or a palpable mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>. In our case, the patient presented with bilateral exophthalmos. Moreover, the involvement of an orbital pseudotumor, proptosis, lacrimal gland, and trigeminal nerve had been reported with IgG4-RD, which shares similar features with KD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Liu et al. indicated that eosinophilia or high IgE levels and lymphadenopathy are often found in patients with IgG4-RD and KD. Similarly, IgG4-RD is an immune-mediated fibroinflammatory condition. It has systemic manifestations characterised by the extensive infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and T lymphocytes into several organs, such as the pancreas, lung, kidney, salivary gland, lymph nodes, gallbladder, bile duct, retroperitoneum, prostate, and ocular adnexa. It has been reported in the literature that pathologically induced tissue fibrosis with obliterative phlebitis and vasculitis was noted in IgG4-RD. Immunoglobulin class switching of B cells to IgG4 and IgE depends on IL-4/IL-13. Indeed, because antigens or abnormal immune factors that induce IgE and eosinophil responses are good inducers of IgG4, immunohistochemistry of IgG4-and IgG-positive plasma cells, and detection of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and TGF-β should be considered to investigate better and understand the relationship between KD and IgG4-RD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 20\\]</u>. Further immunohistochemistry investigations were not performed for our patient, but the clinical manifestations and the lymph node histopathology reports were enough to distinguish KD from IgG-4 RD. However, the increase in his blood IgG levels could be due to KD.\n\n【34】Lee et al. explained that IgG4-related lymphadenopathy exhibits a wide morphological variety that shows five different histological patterns. The KD pattern resembles type number five, which is the least common. It is characterised by focal replacement of the nodal parenchyma by scleral-hyaline tissue with variable infiltration of plasma cells, lymphocytes and eosinophils. Lee and colleagues also highlighted that several morphological features could be used to distinguish KD from IgG4-RD, despite the similarities in lymph node involvement between KD and variant five of IgG4-RD. However, they suggested that the presence of any IgG4-positive plasma cells in the peripheral blood as well as infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in lymph nodes and skin lesions is all epiphenomena of Kimura’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Kottler et al. reported a similar clinical pathology pattern of skin lesions in 25 KD patients to cutaneous IgG4-RD. They also compared 22 KD cases with skin lesions versus 27 published cases of cutaneous IgG4-RD and concluded that both conditions seem to be distinct entities based on clinical and pathological differences. For example, the median age of KD patients is 44.5, whereas the median age of IgG4-RD patients is 63. In addition, no patient with KD has been reported to have pancreatic involvement, whereas autoimmune pancreatitis is a distinguishing feature of IgG4-RD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Moreover, pathological differences in nodal KD and IgG4-related lymphadenopathy have been described in the literature. For instance, the expression of IgE in follicular dendritic cells and eosinophilic microabscesses is only found in KD. Kottler et al. emphasises that clinical features are crucial to differentiate between both conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 27\\]</u>. Indeed, KD shares many physiopathological mechanisms with several diseases, and further research into the aetiology is required.\n\n【37】Surgical excision, radiotherapy, surgical resection combined with low-dose postoperative radiotherapy, and oral corticosteroids are some of the available treatment modalities, but the optimal method is still controversial. Radiotherapy is preferred in cases of recurrent KD when other treatments have failed to control the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 25\\]</u>. Some patients had a positive response to other immunosuppressants, such as Mycophenolate Mofetil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 27\\]</u>. Our patient improved when Mycophenolate Mofetil was used, while his previous treatment with Azathioprine was less effective. However, due to the limited number of cases and the lack of randomised trials, the efficacy of therapy has not been adequately studied.\n\n【38】According to Ye et al. surgical resection followed by postoperative low-dose radiotherapy can achieve the lowest recurrence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Senel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> used immunosuppressants (steroids, Azathioprine, and Cyclosporine) to treat KD patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). They were able to achieve quick improvement, and this regimen was recommended for cases with extensive fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Romao et al. used corticosteroid monotherapy for a patient with FSGS, but the kidney function deterioration was rapid and ended with a kidney transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. In our case, the patient was treated with steroids and immunosuppressants (Azathioprine) after a diagnosis of FSGS was made.\n\n【39】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【40】Despite the unclear presentation and aetiology, Kimura’s disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a subcutaneous neck mass and multiple subcutaneous nodules, especially when the condition appears with atypical systemic involvement and similarity to other hypereosinophilic conditions and IGg-4-related diseases. Indeed, the diagnosis should be based on the combination of characteristic histopathologic, clinical, serologic, and radiologic findings. To ensure favourable outcomes and prevent renal and thrombotic complications, treatment should aim to preserve the function and appearance of affected tissues.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:40:27", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:40:52", "cost": 24.917}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:40:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:40:26"}

Two cases are presented in this paper. One case was treated by ligation and coronary artery bypass. The other was treated by direct reimplantation of the anomalous coronary artery into the aorta.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is a rare but potentially lethal condition. Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) from the pulmonary artery typically presents during infancy, but anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) may go undetected for years. We report two cases of ARCAPA where the diagnosis was supplemented with cardiovascular computed tomography (CCT) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Surgical repair was achieved with ligation and coronary artery bypass in one case and direct reimplantation of the anomalous artery into the aorta in the other.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】Patient no. 1 was a 52-year-old female with progressive dyspnea over several months. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated an angiographically normal LCA. The RCA filled retrograde from the LCA and terminated on the right anterior aspect of the main pulmonary artery (MPA) immediately above the sinus of Valsalva. Multidetector computed tomography was performed to delineate the three-dimensional anatomy of ARCAPA. CMR showed mid-myocardial enhancement of the interventricular septum consistent with fibrosis possibly due to chronic ischemia . Right and left ventricular function was preserved. The left ventricle was dilated (LV end systolic volume index: 37 ml/m<sup>2</sup>, LV end diastolic volume index: 107 ml/m<sup>2</sup>). Due to progressive heart failure symptomatology, she underwent single vessel bypass to the RCA using the right internal mammary artery as conduit. The aberrant RCA was ligated at its junction with the pulmonary artery. At 10-month follow-up, she reported significant improvement in functional capacity. Follow-up CMR showed preserved left ventricular and right ventricular function. The left ventricle had decreased in size (LV end systolic volume index: 24 ml/m<sup>2</sup>, LV end diastolic volume index: 62 ml/m<sup>2</sup>). The right internal mammary artery bypass graft was widely open as demonstrated by coronary angiogram performed one year after the surgery.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Patient no. 1: (a) Volume-rendered computed tomography shows the anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery.

Cardiac catheterization revealed an RCA which originated from the MPA and filled via retrograde flow from the LCA. There was no coronary atherosclerosis. The diagnosis of ARCAPA was confirmed with CMR angiography. Preoperative left and right ventricular function and dimensions assessed by CMR were normal. The patient successfully underwent direct reimplantation of the anomalous RCA into the ascending aorta . The origin of the RCA was located on the right anterolateral aspect of the main pulmonary artery just above the pulmonary valve. At 12-month follow-up, he is asymptomatic and has normal left ventricular function.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Patient no. 2: (a) CMR angiogram demonstrating the anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery.

Discussion\n\n【10】Anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is rare. It is found in 0.01% of 126,596 coronary angiograms performed at the Cleveland Clinic between 1960 and 1988 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Four variations of this condition have been described: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA), 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> origin of an accessory coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> origin of the entire coronary circulation from the pulmonary artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【11】ARCAPA is the second most common of these conditions with an incidence of 0.002% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Typically these patients are asymptomatic and survive into adulthood; however, sudden cardiac death has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A murmur is the most frequent symptom, followed by chest pain, and congestive heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Mechanistically, an intracoronary shunt forms between the high-pressure systemic LCA and the low-pressure pulmonic RCA. The majority of epicardial coronary flow bypasses the myocardium, resulting in coronary “steal” and chronic myocardial ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Chronic ischemia and myocardial fibrosis has been reported at autopsy, and was likely responsible for the myocardial fibrosis noted with CMR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Symptoms result from the chronic left to right shunt and from myocardial ischemia. Chronic volume overload and ischemia can lead to ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. If present, ischemic ventricular dysfunction would be limited to the right ventricle, septum and left ventricular inferior wall. The severity of ventricular ischemia is determined by the shunt size, presence of collateral circulation, territory at risk, and myocardial oxygen demands. Since right ventricular oxygen demands are lower than the left ventricle demands, ventricular ischemia in ARCAPA is felt to be less common than in ALCAPA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, conditions that increase right ventricular oxygen demands (i.e. pulmonary artery stenosis) or large territory at risk (i.e. dominant RCA circulation) may result in increased incidence of ischemic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this series, even though both patients had evidence of ischemia, their ventricular function was preserved. The first patient had evidence of chronic ischemia in the CMR while the second patient presented with a myocardial infarction. Both patients had dominant RCA circulation.\n\n【13】Cardiac CT coronary angiogram (CTA) and CMR provide excellent visualization of coronary artery anomalies. They complement coronary angiography by providing detailed anatomic information of the origin, course, and relationship of the anomalous coronary. In some instances, one modality may be preferable to the other due to relative advantages, limitations and patient-specific factors. CMR, for instance, is usually adequate and requires nonionizing radiation or nephrotoxic contrast. In fact, coronary anomalies may be demonstrated with CMR without contrast using contemporary techniques. Ferromagnetic foreign bodies or active implants such as pacemakers may preclude patient entry into a high-strength magnetic field, making CTA the preferred modality. CTA is not the preferred modality in children or young women due to unpredictable long-term risk of radiation exposure. Further, renal insufficiency may favor noncontrast CMR to define coronary anatomy in patients in whom iodinated contrast for CTA cannot be administered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【14】ARCAPA is managed via surgical correction to eliminate the left-to-right shunt and establish dual antegrade coronary circulation eliminating the potential for myocardial ischemia from coronary steal. Reimplantation of the anomalous vessel is the treatment of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>. Here we also report the successful use of arterial bypass grafting when anatomical considerations make direct reimplantation impractical.\n\n【15】The location of the ostium of the right coronary artery in the pulmonary artery will influence the technique used for surgical repair. RCA origins that are favorable for direct reimplantation into the aorta are: RCA originating from the right or from the anterior aspect of the pulmonary artery or from the right anterior facing sinus of Valsalva. When the origin is from the posterior facing sinus, aortic reimplanation is also possible, but usually requires extensive mobilization of the pulmonary artery and opening or transection of the pulmonary artery to develop the coronary artery button. For RCA originating from the nonfacing sinus of the pulmonary artery, surgical options include direct reimplantation, ligation and coronary bypass, and creation of an intrapulmonary baffle (Takeuchi’s procedure). Direct reimplantation is usually possible because the anomalous RCA has a long course in front of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. However, it will require extensive mobilization of the RCA and reimplantation high on the ascending aorta to prevent kinking.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:50:55", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:52:24", "cost": 89.325}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:52:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:50:52"}

Case Report\n\n【5】A 52-year-old Japanese woman with a 12-year history of psoriasis started anti-TNF-α therapy with adalimumab for exacerbation of skin lesions. The patient was not a habitual drinker and had no concomitant medications at the onset of the therapy. Hepatobiliary enzymes prior to therapy were within normal limits: asparate aminotransferase (AST) 20 U/L (normal value 8–38), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 24 U/L (normal 4–44), and γ\\-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 43 U/L (normal 16–70). Hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were negative. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) measured using ELISA were also negative, 9.7 index (cutoff < 20).\n\n【6】Two months later, after six doses of adalimumab, she developed malaise with liver damage that continued after the discontinuation of adalimumab. A blood test three months after discontinuation showed the following: AST 240 U/L, ALT 224 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 723 U/L (normal 104–338) and GGT 228 U/L. Whilst serological tests for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus were all negative, her serum immunoglobulin G levels were elevated (1969 mg/dL; normal 870–1700) and homogeneous and speckled-type ANAs were both present at titers of 1 : 160. Anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, and anti-DNA antibody were negative. A percutaneous liver biopsy four months after discontinuation of adalimumab showed marked portal lymphoplasmacytic inflammation with periportal interface hepatitis and scattered lobular necroinflammatory changes .

The median time and the number of doses of anti-TNF-α drugs to the onset of liver damage were 2 months and 3 times, respectively. All cases discontinued anti-TNF-α therapy after the onset of liver damage and six were treated with corticosteroid, with or without azathioprine. All cases had good responses to the therapies and prognosis; the liver damage was resolved within approximately 3 months in five cases.

Perhaps, most of them will develop AIH few months after initiation of the treatment and this will be resolved by intensive immunosuppressive therapy.

The histologic diagnosis of these tumors is sometimes difficult, even by stacked (bite-on-bite) biopsies. Generally, asymptomatic patients with submucosal tumors <2 cm can be followed up by periodic endoscopic examinations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. However, the endoscopic surveillance of such submucosal tumors involves issues regarding cost-effectiveness, patients’ compliance, and their anxiety that the tumor may be malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We recently treated a patient with ectopic pancreas in the stomach. The patient presented with a submucosal tumor in the gastric antrum. The tumor was suspected to be ectopic pancreas, but the possibilities of neuroendocrine tumor or other histologic entities could not be excluded. A total biopsy by the endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) technique was performed, and the diagnosis of ectopic pancreas was made. The differential diagnosis of the tumor in this patient and the role of ESD for the diagnosis of submucosal tumors are discussed.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 32-year-old Japanese man underwent a barium swallow examination for the screening of esophagogastroduodenal diseases as part of a routine health checkup. Barium X-ray revealed a protruding lesion in the gastric antrum. The patient then underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy at his family clinic, and it showed a sessile submucosal tumor measuring approximately 10 mm in diameter on the greater curvature of the gastric antrum . The tumor had no apparent umbilication or central dimpling on the surface. There were no other lesions in the upper gastrointestinal tract except for fundic gland polyps. Atrophic changes were absent in the stomach. He was referred to our hospital for a further investigation of the gastric submucosal tumor.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Endoscopic images. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor with a diameter of approximately 10 mm in the greater curvature of the gastric antrum (a). Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a solid tumor with hypoechoic internal echogenicity measuring 11.8 mm, which was located in the deep mucosal and submucosal layers (b). Anechoic duct-like structure was not detected in the tumor.</u>\n\n【8】The patient was currently healthy and had been taking no medications. A physical examination revealed no abnormalities. All laboratory findings were within the normal ranges. An endoscopic ultrasonography examination revealed a solid tumor with a diameter of 11.8 mm, which was located in the deep mucosal and submucosal layers . The internal echogenicity was homogenous and hypoechoic, which was quite similar to the echogenicity of the deep submucosal layer. An anechoic duct-like structure was not detected in the tumor. A biopsy examination was performed, but the pathological examination was not diagnostic since only intact epithelium was obtained. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scanning showed benign hemangiomas in the liver, whereas no lesion was detected in the stomach. Although the biopsy examination failed to provide a pathological diagnosis, ectopic pancreas in the stomach seemed most likely to be based on the location and endosonographic features. However, the possibility of a gastric neuroendocrine tumor (e.g. gastric carcinoid) could not be excluded.\n\n【9】Additional esophagogastroduodenoscopy 6 months later showed that the gastric tumor was unchanged in size and shape. A biopsy examination was performed again but it was also nondiagnostic. At this point, we proposed the following two options to the patient as the follow-up/treatment strategy for his gastric tumor: to repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy examinations annually unless the morphology had changed or to resect the tumor en bloc by the ESD technique as an excisional biopsy. He chose the latter option, and we therefore performed an ESD . After marking by using a dual knife (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), 10% glycerin solution with 0.0025% epinephrine was injected in the submucosa. An initial incision was made by using the dual knife, and the tumor was dissected by using an insulation-tipped diathermic knife (IT Knife-2, Olympus). During dissection of the submucosal layer, the whitish tumor was visualized within the submucosal layer  and the tumor was successfully resected. The pathological examination revealed that the tumor was pancreatic tissues composed of acini, ducts, and islets of Langerhans . Consequently, a diagnosis of an ectopic pancreas of the stomach was made.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Images during the endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).

Discussion\n\n【13】Ectopic pancreas is pancreatic tissue located outside the pancreas without anatomic or vascular continuity with the normal pancreas. The prevalence of ectopic pancreas was reported to be 0.55%–13.7% in autopsy series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Since patients with ectopic pancreas are generally asymptomatic, most ectopic pancreas cases require no treatment. Conversely, surgical resection is required in rare instances, but it may cause complications such as hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>, inflammatory change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, obstructive jaundice, and malignant transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the stomach, the antrum is known as the most common site of ectopic pancreas.\n\n【14】Park et al. investigated the morphologic features of 26 patients with ectopic pancreas, and they observed umbilication or central dimpling in 34.6% (9/26 lesions) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In endoscopic ultrasonography examination, 92.3% (24/26) of the lesions showed hypoechoic echogenicity, and 50.0% (13/26) were heterogeneous. Moreover, an anechoic duct-like structure was detected in 65.4% (17/26) of the tumors. On the basis of the sonographic layer of origin, 53.8% (14/26) of the tumors were found in the submucosal and proper muscle layers with or without extension into the subserosal or serosal layer, whereas the remaining 46.2% (12/26) of the tumors were located in the deep mucosal and/or submucosal layers. In the present patient, ectopic pancreas was the most likely diagnosis, because of the anatomic location and the hypoechoic echogenicity. However, the morphology and endoscopic ultrasonography findings for our patient’s tumor were not conclusive for the diagnosis of ectopic pancreas, since it lacked umbilication, central dimpling, and duct-like anechoic architecture, which are defining characteristics of this disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The differential diagnoses of hypoechoic tumor located in the deep mucosal and submucosal layers as described in the present patient include neuroendocrine tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors are thought to arise from enterochromaffin-like cells that exist in the gastric glands of the gastric mucosa beneath the epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In endoscopic ultrasonography, these tumors are typically visualized as a homogeneous, mildly hypoechoic mass in the mucosal and submucosal layers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. For the pathological diagnosis of submucosal tumors, tissue sampling is essential. In the present patient, a stacked (bite-on-bite) biopsy was performed but adequate tissue was not obtained. Other procedures to take samples for pathological assessment include partial resection of the covering mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19–21\\]</u>, and en bloc resection by an ESD technique. Since resection is recommended for gastric neuroendocrine tumors that are >10 mm because of the risk of lymph node metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>, we proposed the option to resect the tumor en bloc by the ESD technique for a histologic diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【16】The usefulness of ESD for the pathological diagnosis of submucosal tumors has been reported by several groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23–31\\]</u>. Białek et al. performed ESD for 37 patients with submucosal tumors, and they noted that the overall rate of R0 resection was 81.1% (30/37 patients) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Perforation occurred in two patients (2/37, 5.4%), bleeding in one (1/37, 2.7%), and pneumoperitoneum in three (3/37, 8.1%). Catalano et al. reported on the use of ESD for 20 patients with submucosal tumors; R0 resection was done in 90.0% of the patients (18/20). Though perforation occurred in three cases (15%), no patients experienced severe bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Although it has been thought that the en bloc resection of submucosal tumors originating from the proper muscle layer has an increased risk of perforation and bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>, Białek et al. and Catalano et al. concluded that ESD is effective and relatively safe for resecting gastric submucosal tumors of proper muscle origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 30\\]</u>. On the other hand, submucosal tumors confined to submucosal layers are better indicated for en bloc resection by an ESD technique. Hoteya et al. resected nine gastric submucosal tumors of submucosal layer or mucosal muscle origin by ESD, and no complications were encountered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Li et al. performed ESD for 24 patients with 29 lesions of neuroendocrine tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>, and though delayed bleeding occurred in one case (1/29, 3.4%), there were no procedure-related perforations. Consequently, resection by an ESD technique is a possible option for the pathological diagnosis of gastric submucosal tumors, particularly those which originate in the submucosal layer.\n\n【18】The use of ESD in the treatment of ectopic pancreas has been reported by several authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32–36\\]</u>. In 2010, Ryu et al. first evaluated the therapeutic usefulness and safety of ESD in the treatment of gastric ectopic pancreas in four cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. In 2013, Zhong et al. reported the largest single-center case series reported to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. They performed ESD for 46 cases, and the en bloc resection rate was 97.8% (45/46). Therefore, we consider ESD as a treatment option for ectopic pancreas in the stomach, particularly for symptomatic cases or cases with atypical morphological features.\n\n【19】In conclusion, we treated a patient with ectopic pancreas in the stomach. A histologic diagnosis was made by ESD in our patient.

Biopsy from the skin revealed noncaseating granuloma composed of epithelioid cells, and a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made.

Soon after the glucocorticoid therapy was begun, moderate polyuria (from 3.5–4.0 liters daily) occurred. At this time, plasma AVP was undetectable, and urine osmolality was consistently below plasma levels during the hypertonic saline test. In conclusion, we showed in human study that masked diabetes insipidus could be mediated by AVP-independent mechanisms.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】It is well recognized that polyuria is relieved in patients with central diabetes insipidus (CDI), when they also experience glucocorticoid (GC) deficiency; this phenomenon is known as masked diabetes insipidus (DI). However, the mechanisms mediating masked DI are not clear. GC deficiency is known to increase levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and exaggerate the action of AVP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, suggesting that masked DI is mediated mainly by AVP-dependent mechanisms. On the other hand, in animal models of DI (Brattleboro rats; hereditary hypothalamic AVP-deficient rats), GC deficiency caused impaired water excretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, suggesting that AVP-independent mechanisms are also involved. To elucidate the role of AVP in masked DI, it is essential to evaluate plasma AVP levels using a hypertonic saline infusion test before and after GC replacement. However, such cases are seldom reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, most likely because clinicians do not suspect DI during nonpolyuric periods. Thus, the role of AVP in masked DI is still controversial.\n\n【4】Here, we report a patient with sarcoidosis complicated by CDI and GC deficiency in whom a hypertonic saline infusion test was done before and after GC replacement. Results showed that masked DI could be mediated solely by AVP-independent mechanisms.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 28-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of reduced livido and increased fatigability. He had been in good health until 1 year earlier, when he noticed reduced livido. Four months before admission, he noticed frequent headaches, thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria. Because he was voiding urine every hour, he visited his family doctor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a suprasellar mass, and he was thus referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Although polydipsia and polyuria had been gradually relieved by the time of admission, he became aware of increased fatigability.\n\n【7】At the time of admission, he was 176 cm tall and weighed 72 kg. His temperature was 37.6°C, pulse rate was 60/min, and blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. No goiter or enlargement of lymph nodes was noted. Axillar and pubic hair were lost and there was palpable erythematous rush on his forehead . The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Photograph of the skin of the forehead (a) and pathological finding of the skin biopsy (b). Noncaseating granuloma composed of epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells were present. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】Laboratory results revealed the following results: blood urea nitrogen 9.6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, serum sodium 141 mEq/l, potassium 4.0 mEq/l, chloride 100 mEq/l, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphate 3.7 mg/dL, fasting plasma glucose 80 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 0.07 mg/dL. Endocrinologic data revealed a mild decrease in free T4 level (0.6 ng/dL) with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (0.9106 μU/mL) and decreased cortisol (4.7 μg/mL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 6 pg/mL), luteinizing hormone (LH; 0.2 mIU/mL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH; 1.3 mIU/mL), and testosterone (0.05 ng/mL) levels. Urinary cortisol was undetectable. Plasma osmolality was 288 mOsm/kgH<sub>2</sub>O, with a urinary osmolality of 239 mOsm/kgH<sub>2</sub>O, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) was undetectable (<0.15 pg/mL). Urinary output was from 1.5 to 2.2 L/day.\n\n【10】His clinical course and laboratory findings led us to suspect CDI with anterior pituitary dysfunction. We thus performed hormonal provocative tests. The patient was given an infusion of 5% saline at a rate of 0.05 mL/kg for 120 min. Although plasma AVP was undetectable before and after administration of hypertonic saline, urine osmolality (391 mOsm/kgH<sub>2</sub>O) increased above the plasma levels (296 mOsm/kgH<sub>2</sub>O) . Hormonal provocative tests revealed that growth hormone (GH) response to GH-releasing hormone was normal, TSH response to TSH-releasing hormone was low and blunted, and FSH and LH response to LH-releasing hormone were low and blunted . Although ACTH response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) was normal, cortisol response to CRH was low (maximum 13.0 μg/mL). Cortisol response to rapid ACTH stimulation test was low (maximum 15.9 μg/mL). Results of these hormonal tests were compatible with the diagnosis of CDI with partial GC deficiency.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Hypertonic saline test before (a) and after (b) glucocorticoid therapy.

Considering the patient’s age, we first suspected of neurohypophysial germinoma. However, this was unlikely because cerebrospinal fluid was negative for malignant cells, and 𝛽 \\-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels were normal. Next, we suspected sarcoidosis because chest X-ray revealed hilar enlargement. A biopsy from the skin of the forehead was performed, which revealed noncaseating granuloma composed of epithelioid cells . Multinucleated giant cells were also present. Thus, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | T1-weighted MRI of the sella turnica after administration of gadolinium revealed enhancing lesion centrally in the pituitary stalk, which spread continuously to the bottom of the third ventricle, and high intensity of posterior lobe was lost. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【15】While waiting for histologic confirmation of biopsy results, hydrocortisone replacement was begun with a dose of 20 mg daily. Soon after the replacement therapy was begun, moderate polyuria (3.5–4.0 liters daily) occurred . After the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed, he was treated with 40 mg of prednisolone and his general condition improved. The hypertonic saline test was repeated while he was taking 40 mg of prednisolone. Plasma AVP was undetectable during the hypertonic saline test and urine osmolality was consistently below plasma levels, which was compatible with a diagnosis of CDI . He was treated with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | Clinical course. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【17】MRI following prednisolone therapy revealed a reduction in the size of the affected lesion. However, his pituitary function remained unchanged, and he is currently being treated with prednisolone, levothyroxine natrium, HCG, and dDAVP.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】It is difficult to suspect the existence of “masked DI” before starting GC replacement therapy because patients do not complain of characteristic symptoms of DI such as polyuria and polydipsia. The present patient’s symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia gradually decreased while fatigability gradually increased, which prompted us to suspect the likelihood of masked DI. We thus performed the hypertonic saline test even though he did not complain of overt polyuria on admission. Although plasma AVP was undetectable before and after administration of hypertonic saline, urine osmolality increased above plasma levels. Radioimmunoassay for AVP is sensitive enough to detect a small quantity of circulating AVP, suggesting that kidneys can concentrate the urine even if circulating AVP is completely deficient. After starting GC replacement, plasma AVP was undetectable before and after administration of hypertonic saline. However, urine osmolality was consistently below plasma levels. These observations suggest that GC deficiency can cause impaired water excretion, which is not mediated by AVP-dependent mechanisms.\n\n【20】Although AVP-deficient rat models clearly show that GC deficiency can cause impaired water excretion independent of AVP, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In one study, adrenalectomized Brattleboro rats experienced a rise in water permeability of the distal tubules, suggesting that one of the mechanisms might be direct action of GC on renal tubules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. On the other hand, GC dilates both afferent and efferent resistances and results in an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), by which GC increases the rate of water flow into the nephron 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Thus, GC-induced increase in water excretion may be secondary to an elevation in GFR. GC has been reported to directly stimulate the production of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and potentiate the action of ANP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, resulting in increase in GFR. Furthermore, GC deficiency was associated with a significantly lower cardiac index 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore, GC-induced increase in water excretion may be secondary to changes in systemic and renal hemodynamics as well as direct actions on the tubules. Unfortunately, these hemodynamic studies were not done in the present case, although systemic blood pressure and serum creatinine levels were unchanged. Thus, the AVP-independent mechanisms by which GC deficiency caused impaired water excretion in the present case are unknown.\n\n【21】After starting GC therapy, the diagnosis of CDI became certain based on the results of the hypertonic saline infusion test. However, the degree of polyuria (3.5–4 L/d) was moderate, and maximum urine osmolality was not extremely low (259 mOsm/kgH<sub>2</sub>O) despite undetectable AVP. However, we performed the hypertonic saline test soon after starting GC therapy and it is possible that it takes more time until GC completely restores the diluting ability of urine. Not only GC deficiency but also mineralcorticoid (MC) deficiency is involved in the impaired water excretion in adrenalectomized Brattleboro rats. Thus, MC deficiency could be one reason that the degree of polyuria was moderate even after the GC replacement. We did not check the aldosterone level in this study because secretion of aldosterone is usually preserved in patients with central adrenal deficiency.\n\n【22】Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder of unknown cause that is characterized pathologically by noncaseating granuloma. Although involvement of sarcoidosis in the central nervous system is rare (approximately 5%), the hypothalamus is one of the most affected organs in neurosarcoidosis. Thus, various degrees of secondary hypopituitarism can occur. Among them, CDI is the most reported endocrine abnormality, occurring in 25% of patients with neurosarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Although any degree of anterior pituitary insufficiency can also occur, gonadotropin deficiency is most common. In the present case, endocrinologic manifestations (hypogonadism and DI) were the first clinical symptoms of sarcoidosis. Five similar cases have been reported, in which CDI and hypogonadism were the first clinical presentations of neurosarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Thus, endocrinologic manifestations could be the first clinical presentations of neurosarcoidosis. It has been reported that 97% of patients with neurosarcoidosis have systemic involvement of sarcoidosis even if they are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Furthermore, considering that other hypothalamic lesions causing CDI such as Wegener’s granulomatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and IgG4-related sclerosing disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> usually have extra-hypothalamic lesions, clinicians should search for systemic involvement to establish the diagnosis if patients are otherwise asymptomatic. In the present case, careful observation of the skin prompted us to obtain a biopsy specimen, which led to proper diagnosis.\n\n【23】In summary, we report on a patient with sarcoidosis complicated by CDI and GC deficiency, whose urine became concentrated after the administration of hypertonic saline although AVP was undetectable. However, following GC therapy, hypertonic saline failed to concentrate the urine.

Usually, this disease generates neuropsychiatric complications that worsen the quality of life (QOL) of patients in the medium term. We present a case of a 63-year-old male who presented with a diagnosis of advanced Korsakoff’s syndrome and has a clinical history of recurrent memory loss and a history of alcohol abuse. The patient showed difficulty manipulating immediate information, associated with a possible frontal lobe dysfunction, and inability to remember material given through the auditory pathway. The patient showed a psychiatric clinical picture which is constantly worsening his and his immediate caregiver’s QOL. The data obtained demonstrate that the patient presents a progressive cognitive impairment, which in the short term is correlated with Korsakoff-type dementia. It is suggested to carry out functional neurorehabilitation plans aimed at improving the QOL of the patient, his immediate caregiver, and future people with this type of diagnosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Korsakoff’s syndrome (KS) is a neuropsychiatric disease, also defined like a rest state after the encephalopathic disease phase of Wernicke’s encephalopathy. KS is caused by the loss of vitamin B1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Its symptoms include the inability of the patient to form memories related to his immediate verbal memory and alterations in executive function tasks, especially in inhibition tasks. The patient usually presented confabulation and visual and auditory hallucinations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Other symptoms range from abnormal eye movements, motor incoordination, hypotension, elevated heart rate, and muscle weakness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. The incidence of KS is higher in elderly subjects, and it is more prevalent in males. The literature related to neuropsychological and neurobehavioral alterations secondary to a diagnosis of Korsakoff’s syndrome usually is insufficient; however, there are studies that reveal cognitive deficits in working memory and/or immediate verbal memory tasks.\n\n【4】The treatment for KS consists of improving the patient’s quality of life (QOL) immediately, controlling the symptoms, and avoiding the evolution or worsening of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. According to different studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, the KS has an evolutionary and ultimately chronic process. Most of the patients who suffer from this disease usually end up with a clinical picture of Korsakoff’s dementia, which is accompanied by neurobehavioral disorders, disinhibition, irritability, social isolation, hallucinations, delusions of persecution, and aberrant motor behavior.\n\n【5】Other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u> demonstrate the existence of cognitive deficiencies in comparison with control subjects, alterations to plan and control immediate behavior (executive functions), inability to consolidate information containing new learning (working memory), and the storage and recall of long-term memory; the neuroanatomical structures that are usually involved are the frontal lobe of executive nature, the temporal lobe (for the consolidation and evocation of information), and diencephalic structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and fronto-subcortical circuits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Other findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> demonstrate alterations in the execution of visuospatial and visuoconstructive tasks, language, emotional area, and personality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The aim of this work is to investigate the neuropsychiatric alterations presented by the patient with a diagnosis of advanced Korsakoff’s syndrome.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】The case of a 63-year-old male patient, married, right-handed, occupation: industrial engineer, with higher education is reported. The patient presented with recurrent memory loss without loss of consciousness, accompanied by a mixed clinical picture of depression with a greater prevalence of anxiety.\n\n【8】The clinical history reveals an antecedent of alcohol abuse since the age of 16, related to a clinical evolution with apparent neurological deficit, aware, and oriented but with low verbal fluency. The general examination showed no evident alterations, and his vital signs were normal, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse 80, and respiratory rate 20. The patient takes losartan (every 12 hours) to treat his blood pressure and vitamin B1 (thiamine) to regulate his body.\n\n【9】In the neurological examination, the patient was conscious, aware, oriented in his individual, temporal and spatial sphere/dimensions, but with low verbal fluency, mild alterations in gait, difficulty in taking a sequence of steps, and clinical bradypsychia.\n\n【10】The MRI revealed widening of cerebral sulci at a cortical level  volumetric reduction of brain tissue and involvement of superior frontal gyrus. In the sagittal section is observed atrophy in the marginal callosal fissure, widening of the paracentral sulcus, and atrophy in the superior frontal gyrus (seen from the medial side) . The image at the coronal slice  revealed another temporal lobe involvement, especially in the lateral fissure or Sylvian fissure, with the left hippocampal atrophy involvement which is related to a deficit in consolidation processes and information storage.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Results of MRI at cortical (a), sagittal (b), and coronal sections at the level of the temporal lobe (c) showing widening of cerebral sulci, subcortical atrophy, and hippocampal atrophy in the patient with advanced Korsakoff’s syndrome.</u>\n\n【12】We have a neuropsychology clinic protocol with the neuropsychological tests for the evaluation of the patient . The direct score obtained in each of the tests has been considered, except for the DRS, in which the total score and the values of each of its subsections were considered. Table 2 shows the results of each of the neuropsychological tests.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Assessment protocol that aims at neuropsychological tasks as a function of Korsakoff’s syndrome in the patient.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Scores obtained in different neuropsychological tasks as a function of a patient with Korsakoff’s syndrome.</u>\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】The patient does not present clinical signs of depression. The test score shows that there is no presence of low emotional reactivity; however, it has revealed a clinical picture of generalized anxiety. The test results indicate that the patient presents a clinical picture of moderate-severe psychosocial stress, associated with movement, impatience, and motor fluctuations at the time of evaluation. The patient is partially oriented in time, place, and space. The results of the MMSE reveal alterations in memory tasks, inhibition tasks, and visuospatial functions. The results are not within the expected range.\n\n【17】During the evaluation of the attentional functions, in the DRS and TMT’s sections that evaluate attention tasks, the patient showed not being able to maintain the attentional focus (focused attention) on each of the stimuli presented .\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Trail making test (TMT) form A results. Duration: 3′52″.</u>\n\n【19】It has been identified as a difficulty for a behavioral response during the test; additionally, it has found the inability to process several stimuli at the same time; in this case, the patient cannot generate a response to one stimulus in the presence of others (TMT part A and B) (selective attention) . Similarly, there was no evidence of cognitive interferences that would impede the performance of the tests. These data show that the patient could present alterations in brain areas that are usually related to attention, especially in working memory tasks, generally correlated with the frontal lobe.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Trail making test (TMT) form B results. Duration: 3′47″.</u>\n\n【21】The patient’s memory has been assessed using the digit retention test, Babcock’s story recall test, clock-drawing test, Rey’s complex figure test, and an immediate and delayed verbal memory task. During the evaluation, the patient presented severe difficulty to process immediate information; this has been revealed by the use of material that stimulates short-term memory; additionally, he showed to not be able to retain new information or generate new learning. The digit retention test revealed a very low score; therefore, the patient could present an inability to manipulate information in situations which require quick decisions.\n\n【22】The patient is not able to remember the information immediately given. This type of memory has been evaluated by Babcock’s story recall test. The test revealed that the patient presents difficulty to explain the verbal material presented by the auditory pathway; moreover, he did not present the cognitive skills necessary to register, encode, consolidate, and recover the information previously given. Similarly, in Rey’s complex figure test, a test was presented visually; the patient demonstrates to be unable to complete the figure presented on the test; then, in the memory test, he could not perform it. These results suggest a serious difficulty related to short- and long-term memory in tasks of visuospatial functioning and visuoconstructive skills. Despite the results of the copy, the patient defines some details, but it is not enough for the expected range for his age.\n\n【23】These results are confirmed by the DRS’s memory subsections, which revealed the lack of skills or cognitive strategies in the patient to process, consolidate, and recall information. The scores obtained are below the expected. Similarly, in the memory test, a low score has been obtained, which confirms an inability in working memory tasks and short- and long-term memory tasks, thereby, preventing the preservation of the mnesics content and dysfunction of brain structures associated with memory such as the neurocognitive domain. In the clock-drawing test, it was also identified (in command and copy) that there is no visual and motor organization to reproduce, store, and recall the task .\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Clock test on command.</u>\n\n【25】From executive functions results, it was found that the patient presents an inability to plan, organize, and regulate his immediate behavior. The DRS revealed that the patient lacks motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions to perform activities that require intentionality, control, and behavior in the execution of a task, the same situation is for the FAB; although the score is very low and may denote a clinical picture of dementia, because of his age and the presence of KS, it cannot be delimited in this way, a similar situation is for the DRS. The explanation for this data is that the patient´s disease is still evolving, generating a clinical picture of cognitive deficit, which is represented by a cortico-subcortical atrophy, that affects the cognitive domains previously explained. In this case, the domain affected is verbal fluency because the patient did not present the mental and oral flexibility to generate common names, animals, and both in an alternating state. These data are possibly related to the dysfunction in his frontal lobe and dorsolateral cortex.\n\n【26】Regarding the basic and instrumental activities of daily living, the Barthel index revealed that the patient is independent; nevertheless, these data have not been confirmed by the Lawton and Brody scale, which revealed that the patient is entering a phase of dependence that needs to be assessed immediately, since it may be an indicator of progressive cognitive impairment, which as the disease evolves, may be reflected in a clinical picture of dementia.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【28】The results indicate that the patient presents neuropsychological alterations in neurocognitive domains, such as attention, because the patient is not able to retain the attentional focus, or to manipulate the information when presented with different stimuli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【29】The data obtained by different studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u> indicate that patients with KS usually present severe problems in the storage, processing, consolidation, and evocation of information, as occurs with the case report. The patient showed difficulty generating new memories; his mental processes in relation to brain structures in the storage of information do not allow the condensation and recovery correlated with the immediate operative and/or verbal memory.\n\n【30】Also, the deferred verbal memory showed to be altered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> because the patient demonstrates to be unable to access previously learned memories, a situation that usually gets worse during the evolution of the disease; therefore, it requires immediate and multidisciplinary attention.\n\n【31】In executive functioning tasks, it has been found that serious difficulties regulate and control the immediate behavior; the age and KS that the patient suffers are directly correlated with the cortico-subcortical atrophy that he is presenting, which causes a lower performance in tasks that require cognitive flexibility, conceptualization, and the definition of clear goals or objectives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Unfortunately, the patient showed to be unable to generate a behavioral pattern that is accompanied by a new response, and against a variety of stimuli, his low verbal fluency demonstrates the inability to have executive control, anticipation, action, and planning to perform certain motor behaviors having a clear and specific purpose. These alterations may be related to a dysexecutive syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. These neuropsychological deficits are correlated with frontal hypometabolism in positron emission tomography (PET) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Regarding the activities of daily living, the patient is moderately independent; however, by making errors such as confuse the denomination of money and forget the consumption of his medications, suggest and even affirm, that in a short time, the clinical picture of the patient could progress to Korsakoff-type dementia, which is linked to the score he obtained in the GHQ-28. Currently, the patient presents a neuropsychiatric episode where he does not recognize his disease, accompanied by the chronicity of each of his symptoms, especially in anxiety and less in depression. For this reason, it is a necessary multidisciplinary intervention, which comprises specialties such as internal medicine, psychology, neuropsychology, neurology, physiotherapy, and occupational health, which have a clear objective, the improvement of his QOL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–14\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Based on the results obtained, it can be inferred that the patient in the medium term will present a progressive neurocognitive deficit associated with a possible clinical picture of dementia due to KS. It is considered necessary to carry out prevention campaigns focused on Korsakoff’s disease, with the purpose of preventing major neuropsychological alterations in patients with this type of diagnosis. Also, neurorehabilitation plans by expert neuropsychologists become a unique opportunity to improve the quality of life in patients with this disorder. Future lines of research should focus on functional neurorehabilitation plans aimed at the early diagnosis and treatment of this disease, accompanied by epidemiological studies focused on the study of the incidence and prevalence of this disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:44:20", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:45:28", "cost": 68.164}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:45:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:44:18"}

Three cases of unexplained painful thyroid which were successfully treated with hemi or total thyroidectomy are presented.

Surgical therapy is a successful final option in the treatment of unexplained painful thyroid and painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Painful thyroid has a limited differential diagnosis. In addition to trauma and nodular hemorrhages, subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain thyroiditis, is the most common cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Subacute thyroiditis is a mostly bilateral inflammatory disorder causing a slightly swollen, tender thyroid gland, frequently accompanied by thyrotoxicosis. Markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein levels are hallmarks of this disorder. A viral cause has been proposed, as it is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. The condition is self-limiting and symptomatic treatment with analgetics usually suffices. Sometimes corticosteroids are needed. Rare causes of a painful thyroid gland are infection, radiation induced-thyroiditis, malignancy, and neuralgia of the superior laryngeal nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In case of infection, surgical therapy can be indicated when antibiotic therapy is inadequate or drainage of an abscess is necessary. Nodular hemorrhages and radiation-induced thyroiditis are usually self-limiting conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Neuralgia of the superior laryngeal nerve is a complex pain disorder and may require high-dose analgetics and peripheral blockade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In rare cases, no clear cause for a painful thyroid gland can be found after careful clinical, biochemical, and radiological analysis. This may lead to extensive patient morbidity and frustration when symptomatic treatment proves insufficient. Hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy may then be the last resort for doctor and patient. Three cases of unexplained painful thyroid that were successfully treated with surgical therapy are presented, and the differential diagnosis is discussed.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case 1\n\n【6】A 41-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of a cesarean section and a diagnostic laparoscopy presented with an extremely painful right thyroid gland since four months. Some weeks before the onset of the pain she suffered from an upper respiratory tract infection. There was no fever. The pain was constant and increased on swallowing. The patient was initially treated by the family physician. Analgetics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and morphinomimetics did not decrease the pain. On physical examination the right thyroid lobe was not enlarged but extremely painful on palpation. There were no obvious thyroid nodes. The left thyroid lobe was normal. There were no enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. Laboratory tests showed euthyroidism: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 0.59 mU/L (normal value 0.4–4.4 mU/L), free thyroxine (T4) level was 19.4 pmol/L (normal value 10–24 pmol/L), and triiodothyronine (T3) level was 1.7 nmol/L (normal value 1.3–2.6 nmol/L). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody level was low (<10 ku/L). Leukocyte count (6,400/mm<sup>3</sup>), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (11 mm/h), and C-reactive protein level (7 mg/dL) were within normal limits. Ultrasonography showed multiple nodes in the right thyroid lobe with a maximum diameter of 12 mm without any signs of haemorrhage or abscess. The dental surgeon and otolaryngologist excluded referred pain from dental or nasopharyngeal pathology. The patient was treated with analgetics and subsequently corticosteroids for several weeks based on the presumed diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. However, this did not resolve the symptoms. The pain was increasingly invalidating and led to absence of work. Finally, 6 months after onset of symptoms, a right hemithyroidectomy was performed. The specimen measured 5 × 3 × 3  cm. Histological study revealed diffuse hyperplasia with prominent uncomplicated hyperplastic nodes and some mild lymphocytic thyroiditis . Immediately after surgery the pain had disappeared completely. Up to one year following surgery the patient was free of pain and had a normal thyroid function.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Diffuse hyperplasia with prominent uncomplicated hyperplastic nodes and some lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hematoxylin-eosin, ×200). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Case 2\n\n【9】A 41-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of laparoscopic gastric banding for morbid obesity and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy presented with an extremely painful right thyroid lobe. Since several months she had experienced palpitations and heat intolerance, and since three weeks extreme pain had developed in the right thyroid lobe during a period of fever and malaise. She had not noticed any enlargement of the thyroid gland. There had been no weight loss or other physical changes. Analgesic therapy did not relieve the symptoms. On physical examination there were no signs of thyrotoxicosis. There was a slightly enlarged left thyroid lobe without any palpable nodes and a palpable node of approximately 2 cm in the right lobe, which was very painful on examination. There were no enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. Laboratory tests revealed thyrotoxicosis: TSH level was 0.02 mU/L (normal value 0.4–4.4 mU/L) and free thyroxine (T4) level 60.7 pmol/L (normal value 10–24 pmol/L). There were no detectable thyroid-stimulating antibodies or TPO antibodies. There was no leukocytosis (4,400/mm<sup>3</sup>), erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 29 mm/h, and there was a slight increase in C-reactive protein (23 mg/dL). A Tc-99M scan showed a slightly enlarged thyroid with normal 24-hour uptake, and a cold node on the right side of 4 cm, as well as a node on the left side (3 cm) with normal uptake. Fine-needle aspiration yielded no conclusive diagnosis. The otolaryngologist excluded any pharyngeal or tracheal pathology. The following causes were considered in the differential diagnosis: subacute thyroiditis of de Quervain or an early hyperthyroid phase of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis). The thyroid function returned to normal within two months without any antithyroid therapy. However, the right hemithyroid remained extremely painful. The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and morphinomimetics for several weeks without any improvement of symptoms. Finally, four months after onset of pain, a right hemithyroidectomy was performed. The specimen measured 4 × 4 × 2  cm. Histological study showed some nodular hyperplasia with degenerative changes, a limited lymphocytic thyroiditis, and a focal area with sclerosis. Elsewhere, bleeding and signs of previous bleeding were seen. Remarkable was the presence of adipose metaplasia of thyroid stroma . Immediately after surgery the pain had disappeared completely. Up to several months after surgery, the patient was free of pain and had a normal thyroid function.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Nodular hyperplasia with degenerative changes, a limited lymphocytic thyroiditis and adipose metaplasia of thyroid stroma.

Case 3\n\n【12】A 17-year-old Caucasian woman with no prior medical history presented with an extremely painful thyroid. She had noticed gradual enlargement of the thyroid gland since five years, but more rapid growth during the last six months, accompanied by pain on the right side. Moreover, she had difficulty swallowing because of pain, resulting in decreased food intake and 10 kg weight loss during the last six months. In addition, she complained of a coarse voice since several months. There was no fever. Analgetic therapy did not relieve the symptoms. On physical examination there were no signs of hypo- or hyperthyroid function. There was a WHO grade II goiter without palpable nodules which was extremely painful on examination. There were no enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and there were no signs of respiratory distress. Laboratory tests showed biochemical euthyroidism: TSH level was 3.77 mU/L (normal value 0.4–4.4 mU/L), free thyroxine (T4) level was 13.4 pmol/L (normal value 10–24 pmol/L), and triiodothyronine (T3) level was 2.1 nmol/L (normal value 1.3–2.6 nmol/L). TPO antibody level was increased (459 ku/L). There was no increased leukocyte count (3,400/mm<sup>3</sup>) or increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (5 mm/h). An I-123 scan showed a homogenously enlarged thyroid (slightly more increased on the right side) with a 24-hour uptake of 42%. The otolaryngologist excluded any pharyngeal or tracheal pathology. Esophagogastroscopy revealed no pathology explaining difficulty swallowing or weight loss. Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid revealed lymphocytic thyroiditis, in accordance with the diagnosis of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids for several months without any improvement of symptoms. Finally, eight months following onset of pain, a total thyroidectomy was conducted. Histological study indeed showed a very severe lymphocytic thyroiditis with formation of lymphatic follicles . Immediately after surgery the pain had disappeared completely. Up to several years following surgery the patient was free of pain.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Severe lymphocytic infiltration with formation of lymphatic follicles and Hürthle cells (Hematoxylin-eosin, ×100). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【14】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【15】This case series describes three patients with extreme, invalidating pain located within the thyroid gland, which could not adequately be managed by symptomatic treatment. The complaints resolved completely and immediately upon surgical removal of the painful thyroid tissue.\n\n【16】The clinical presentation in the first case is reminiscent of subacute thyroiditis which is sometimes preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection. However, unilateral pain, normal levels of C-reactive protein, and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate are not in agreement with this diagnosis. Moreover, subacute thyroiditis is often characterized by thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism. The symptoms usually improve dramatically following the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Finally, the histological specimens did not show the typical changes expected in subacute thyroiditis nor yielded any other cause for the patient’s complaints.\n\n【17】In the second case, the differential diagnosis included early hyperthyroid phase of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) and subacute thyroiditis. Unilateral pain, however, is not typical for either condition. The absence of thyroid antibodies would support subacute thyroiditis. However, a normal 24-hour I-123 uptake or Tc-99M scan and the only slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels are more in favour of HT. We could not document histological changes confirming HT nor subacute thyroiditis.\n\n【18】Histological evaluation of the thyroid gland of the third case clearly identified HT. This autoimmune disease is characterized by painless goiter, and hypothyroidism is sometimes preceded by a hyperthyroid phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. TPO antibodies are usually elevated, but they may be low or even absent in HT. Rarely, it may present as a painful goiter and sometimes clinically resembles subacute thyroiditis. Although painful HT often presents with fever, transient thyrotoxicosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, patients may also be euthyroid or hypothyroid, and infection parameters may be normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The diagnosis of HT in the case of an extremely painful thyroid is therefore typically based on histological studies. Although painful HT has been previously described, the literature is limited to case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–12\\]</u>. Initial treatment for painful HT is typically symptomatic with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids or may be focused on hormone replacement therapy. Quite often this might not be sufficient. In these cases surgical treatment has proven a successful option, in accordance with our observation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>. Clinical features and pain relief following surgery of all patients presented in the literature that were surgically treated for painful HT are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Characteristics of fifteen patients with painful Hashimoto’s thyroiditis who underwent thyroidectomy.</u>\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Pain relief to treatment and surgical pathology in fifteen cases of painful Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.</u>\n\n【21】Speculation on the cause of pain in the first two cases includes atypical viral infection since both patients had experienced a prodromal period of fever and malaise. Another speculation is that even uncomplicated thyroid nodes might cause severe pain in exceptional cases.\n\n【22】The differential diagnosis of unilateral thyroid pain includes superior laryngeal neuralgia, a complex pain disorder which is thought to represent a “referred pain” from the pharyngeal and laryngeal regions. A viral infection has also been proposed. A substrate for superior laryngeal neuralgia is seldom found. The pain is typically located between the thyroid and the ear and is described as paroxysmal and “electrical”. There is usually a trigger point, and episodes may be accompanied by nausea or excessive lacrimation. Treatment is symptomatic and may require high-dose analgetics and peripheral blockade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 5\\]</u>. However, none of the above-mentioned clinical presentations resembled superior laryngeal neuralgia.\n\n【23】In conclusion, we describe three patients with extreme invalidating pain which severely interfered with daily activities and work. In all cases symptomatic treatment was not successful. The pain was immediately relieved by hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy. Remarkably, extensive histological evaluation did not yield a satisfactory explanation for the extreme thyroid pain in two cases, and in one case, HT was found. This indicates that surgical therapy is a successful final option in the treatment of unexplained painful thyroid and painful HT.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:55:04", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:56:12", "cost": 68.108}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:56:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:55:03"}

Blood results at presentation showed Hb 14.8 g/dL, Cr 0.7 mg/dL, estimated GFR 68.1 mL/min, WBC /μL, CRP 5.35 mg/dL, LDH 184 IU/L, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> 9.9 mg/dL. Urine cytology was negative for malignant cells.Contrast enhanced CT showed an unevenly contrasted tumor, infiltrating almost all renal parenchyma, filling the renal pelvis and ureter, and extending into the urinary bladder . There were no apparent metastases to lung, liver, adrenal glands, or lymph nodes. With a tentative diagnosis of renal pelvic tumor, we didnot perform perioperative biopsy, and she underwent nephroureterectomy with hilar lymph node dissection. Macroscopically the tumor almost replaced the whole kidney. The renal pelvis and ureter were extensively packed with the tumor. Histological examination  revealed a clear cell RCC, grade 2 > 1, with microvascular invasion, Fuhrman grade 2, without any sarcomatoid elements. There was no evidence of a venous thrombus or metastasis to lymph nodes. Leibovich score was 6. Postoperative course was uneventful, but 6 months later multiple pulmonary metastases were detected.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Cystoscopy showed the tumor emanating from the left ureteral orifice. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】(a) Horizontal view\n\n【8】(b) Sagittal view\n\n【9】(a) Horizontal view  \n(b) Sagittal view\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Contrast enhanced CT showed a left renal tumor with heterogenous enhancement .

Discussion\n\n【13】Although RCC may penetrate the renal pelvis, intraluminal spread into the renal pelvis and ureter is extremely rare with only a few cases reported in the English literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–6\\]</u>. Munechika et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, Chen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, and Fujita et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported similar cases, although the tumor extension was limited in the renal pelvis and ureter. Gulati et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> reported a case in which the tumor protruding from the ureteral orifice was resected transurethrally and confirmed as a clear cell RCC. Interestingly, in these cases, as well as ours, no visible venous thrombus was reported. We did not resect the tumor in the bladder transurethrally because we considered it was less likely lymphoma, whose tumor marker, soluble IL-2R, was 643 U/mL a little over normal range.\n\n【14】Also, enhanced CT findings did not show hypovascular pattern, suggesting that it would not be sarcoma.\n\n【15】Intraluminal spread of the upper urinary tract by other types of cancer has also been documented . Thorup reported a case of implantation of colonic adenocarcinoma which occluded the ureter a year after the surgery with ureteral injury. Tsurumaki et al. described a case of uterine endometrioid carcinoma filling the upper urinary tract 11 years after hysterectomy with partial ureterectomy for invasion.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 The implantation and/or invasion to urothelial mucosa followed by intraluminal expansive growth would be the pathogenesis of this rare manifestation.

Introduction\n\n【3】Thrombosis in the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a rare but serious condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. It is typically associated with vague symptoms such as abdominal pain, back pain, flank pain, leg pain, and swelling, which can vary in severity depending on the level of the thrombus in the vein. The causes of IVC thrombosis can vary, ranging from hypercoagulable states and tumors to pregnancy and congenital or acquired anomalies in the anatomy of the vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Although relatively uncommon, IVC thrombosis is associated with a higher risk of mortality than the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) alone, making early diagnosis and treatment essential for optimal patient outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In this case report, we describe a patient with thrombosis in the IVC who presented with a constellation of symptoms and underwent successful treatment with anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 39-year-old male presented to the emergency department with right flank pain that had progressed to severe back pain, bilateral flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain over the course of two days. The pain was severe enough to affect his daily activities. He had no significant medical history and had been treated with analgesics at a local health center prior to presenting to the emergency department. Given analgesics, the patient’s back pain decreased. However, he reported that his bilateral testicular pain and bilateral thigh pain became severe. His vital signs were BP 120/80 mmHg, pulse 130 beats/min, RR 20 breaths/min, and temperature 37°C. The leg raising test was negative, and the neurovascular bundle was intact. Scrotal exam was unremarkable. Since both the cremasteric reflex and Phren’s sign yielded negative results, an official scrotal Doppler ultrasound was not performed. There was no lower limb edema or swelling. Laboratory investigations revealed a D-dimer level of 17 mg/L (normal range: 0–0.49 mg/L), creatinine level of 124 µmol/L (normal range: 64–110 µmol/L), and a white blood cell count of 10 × 10<sup>3</sup>/L (normal range: 4–10 10<sup>3</sup>/L) with a CRP level of 5 mg/L (normal range: 0–5 mg/L). The patient’s prothrombin time showed a slight elevation at 13.8 seconds (normal range: 9.4–12.5 seconds), while APTT and INR levels remained within the normal ranges (APTT: 28.4 seconds, normal range: 25.1–36.5 seconds; INR: 1.1, normal range: ≤1.1).\n\n【7】Urine analysis was positive for blood. Bedside abdominal ultrasound showed no significant abnormalities. Doppler ultrasound of both legs showed deep vein thrombosis extending from the external iliac veins to the distal veins of both legs. Further investigation with computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins . There was no evidence of renal calculi or other abdominal pathology. Following admission, a comprehensive coagulopathy blood panel was conducted. Protein C levels were in the normal range (89%), but protein S levels were suboptimal (49.9%), likely influenced by the patient’s ongoing warfarin sodium therapy. Lupus anticoagulant was not detected, and the patient demonstrated effective anticoagulation with warfarin (ATAC 91%). Our patient, despite the absence of any family history of thrombosis, received a diagnosis of Factor V Leiden syndrome through genetic testing, which unveiled a heterozygous mutation in the F5 gene. He was started on low molecular weight heparin and warfarin, and after five days of hospitalization, he was discharged with warfarin for long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins.</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a serious condition that can cause a range of symptoms, making it a challenging diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This case report described a patient who presented with a variety of symptoms, including severe back pain, flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain, which were ultimately attributed to IVC thrombosis. The patient was successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【11】Our case report is unique in which it describes a patient with a large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins, which are relatively uncommon locations for IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In addition, the patient presented with a constellation of symptoms that included scrotal pain, which is an uncommon presentation of IVC thrombosis. The case also emphasizes the importance of genetic testing to identify underlying hypercoagulable states, such as Factor V Leiden syndrome, in patients with IVC thrombosis.\n\n【12】The symptoms of IVC thrombosis can be vague and nonspecific, making the diagnosis challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The patient in this case presented with right flank pain that had progressed to severe back pain, bilateral flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain over the course of two days. The pain was severe enough to affect his daily activities. These symptoms can be indicative of a variety of conditions, including musculoskeletal pain, urological disorders, and vascular disease, making it difficult to make an accurate diagnosis based on clinical presentation alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Laboratory investigations, including D-dimer levels, creatinine levels, and a white blood cell count, can help support the diagnosis of IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case, the patient had an elevated D-dimer level and a slightly elevated creatinine level. These laboratory findings are consistent with IVC thrombosis, as D-dimer is a marker of thrombosis, and an elevated creatinine level can be indicative of renal insufficiency, which can occur as a result of IVC thrombosis.\n\n【14】Sudden onset of testicular pain requires immediate evaluation, including a comprehensive medical history, thorough physical examination, urinalysis, and imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. An urgent situation such as testicular torsion, characterized by a high-riding testicle, demands swift action and confirmation to prevent potential testicular loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. Based on our examination and urinalysis, we were able to confidently rule out any potential medical emergencies for our patient. Although less frequent, nonscrotal factors can also trigger testicular pain due to shared nerve pathways (T10–T12, L1-L2, and S2–S4). Conditions such as kidney stones, lower back issues, aortic aneurysms, spinal disc protrusions, hernias, and other abdominal problems that utilize these common nerve routes may manifest as sudden testicular pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In our case, the patient’s testicular pain was likely due to the presence of the thrombus in the iliac veins, which can cause venous congestion and swelling in the scrotum. It is important for clinicians to consider IVC thrombosis in the differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with testicular pain, particularly in patients with known risk factors such as hypercoagulable states.\n\n【15】Bedside abdominal ultrasound is a useful tool for evaluating a wide range of conditions in the acute care setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>, but it has limitations and may not always provide a definitive diagnosis. If a bedside abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate for IVC thrombosis and no abnormal findings were detected, there could be several reasons why this occurred.\n\n【16】Firstly, it is possible that the thrombus was located in a segment of the IVC that was not adequately visualized by the ultrasound exam. The sensitivity of ultrasound for detecting IVC thrombosis can be affected by several factors, including the size and location of the thrombus and the quality of the ultrasound equipment and technique used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In addition, if the thrombus is partially or completely occlusive, there may still be some blood flow within the IVC, which can make it more difficult to detect with ultrasound. Imaging studies, including Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans, can help to confirm the diagnosis of IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive and cost-effective way to diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can be a precursor to IVC thrombosis. In this case, Doppler ultrasound revealed DVT extending from the external iliac veins to the distal veins of both legs. CT scans can provide more detailed information about the location and extent of the thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, a CT scan of the abdomen revealed a large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins.\n\n【18】The causes of IVC thrombosis can vary, ranging from hypercoagulable states and tumors to pregnancy and congenital or acquired anomalies in the anatomy of the vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case, the patient was diagnosed with Factor V Leiden syndrome based on genetic testing, which revealed a heterozygous mutation in the F5 gene. Factor V Leiden is a common genetic risk factor for thrombosis, and individuals with this mutation have an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), including IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Treatment for IVC thrombosis typically involves anticoagulation therapy, which can prevent the thrombus from growing and reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The patient in this case was started on low molecular weight heparin and warfarin, and after five days of hospitalization, he was discharged with warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. It is important to note that anticoagulation therapy can increase the risk of bleeding, and careful monitoring is required to ensure that the patient’s INR is within the therapeutic range.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】The presented case highlights the challenge of diagnosing IVC thrombosis due to its nonspecific symptoms and emphasizes the importance of considering this condition in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with back pain, flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain. Laboratory investigations, imaging studies, and genetic testing can aid in the diagnosis of IVC thrombosis and identifying underlying hypercoagulable states. Anticoagulation therapy is the mainstay of treatment, but careful monitoring is required to avoid complications, such as bleeding. Clinicians should consider IVC thrombosis in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with testicular pain, particularly in those with known risk factors. Early recognition and management of IVC thrombosis can prevent life-threatening complications, including pulmonary embolism.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:04", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:17", "cost": 12.134}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:04"}

One such known extrapulmonary manifestation of disseminated TB is vertebral osteomyelitis, often referred to as “Pott’s Disease.” We present the case of a patient who underwent back surgery with allogenic bone graft who developed vertebral osteomyelitis and subsequently had disseminated tuberculosis, from an infected bone graft. We review current guidelines for allograft tissue screening and discuss the possible need for standardizing tuberculosis screening for bone allografts.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

While primarily transmitted through aerosolization of respiratory droplets via cough, coughing is not mandatory for transmission. Any respiratory activity has been shown to increase risk of transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We report the first case of a patient who underwent allograft bone graft placement with lumbar fusion and developed disseminated TB from contaminated bone graft.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】Patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral arterial disease status after prior left common iliac stenting and neurogenic claudication secondary to L3-L4 spinal stenosis who presented to the hospital for generalized weakness, fatigue, and headache for 3 weeks. She also complained of intermittent back pain, fever, chills, and night sweats. She described new onset migraine like headache with photophobia in the last month. She denied coughing, shortness of breath, history of headaches, or any other new symptoms. She recently had minimally invasive L3–L5 lumbar fusion surgery with allograft bone graft placement 4 months ago. Her family history was unremarkable. Her social history was positive for 20 pack years of prior tobacco abuse. She quit smoking 2 years ago. She denied any alcohol or recreational drug use. On admission, her vitals including temperature were unremarkable. Her physical showed that patient was oriented to person and place, but not time. She was aware of her reasoning for admission but could not answer all questions appropriately. Healed incisions without any erythema, pus, or drainage were noted in the lower back at the L3–L5 level. Cranial nerves II–XII were grossly intact. Bilateral lower extremity strength was 4/5, unchanged from before, and no other focal deficits were noted. Laboratory evaluation was significant for sodium level of 117 mmol/L from 129 mmol/L two months prior, chloride of 77 mmol/L, and elevated platelet count of 425,000/μL. ESR and CRP were elevated at >130 mm/h and 61.8 mg/L, respectively. TSH was normal at 2.4 mIU/mL. The random cortisol level was elevated at 29.5 μg/dL. Serum osmolality was 256 mOsm/Kg. Urine osmolality was 487 mOsm/kg. Urine sodium and potassium were 32 mmol/L and 47 mmol/L, respectively. Urine toxicology and HIV test were negative. At this time, the treatment team and neurosurgeon who performed the lumbar surgery were informed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) that the bone graft used in her surgery was contaminated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A chest X-ray  was done and showed diffuse miliary nodular pattern of both the lungs, which was confirmed by the presence of innumerable micronodules on CT chest .\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest X-ray of our patient showing diffuse nodular involvement of the lungs.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CT scan axial view showing conforming military tuberculosis with numerous 1–3 mm punctuate nodules.</u>\n\n【8】MRI of the brain with contrast did not show any evidence of hydrocephalus, space-occupying lesions, or basilar meningitis. A lumbar puncture was done, and the results are given in Table 1.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Lumbar puncture results of our patient.</u>\n\n【10】MRI of the lumbar spine showed L4-L5 osteomyelitis and postsurgical changes .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 MRI of the lumbar spine revealing osteomyelitis at the L4-L5 level.</u>\n\n【12】MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine was negative for any structural lesions. Due to the lack of cord compression symptoms and no evidence of compression of the thecal sac of the lumbar cistern, leading to severe stenosis, the risk of reoperating was deemed to be higher than any benefit. The decision was made between the infectious disease team and neurosurgery team to treat the patient medically and not have any further neurosurgical intervention. The patient was treated for disseminated TB from the graft infection with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Ethambutol was switched to levofloxacin. Patient’s mentation and headache improved gradually. Patient was discharged with plan for 12 weeks of total antituberculosis TB therapy. At 3-month follow-up, patient was noted to be doing well, and her symptoms, including back pain, headache, photophobia, encephalopathy, and weakness, had completely resolved. A repeat MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast did not show any further osteomyelitis.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】More than 500,000 bone graft procedures are performed in the United States annually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Autogenous bone graft, made using the patient’s own bone, is most commonly used. However, due to difficulty in obtaining autogenous bone grafts, their use is often limited. A commonly used viable alternative is allogenous bone grafts. Allografts are obtained from qualified living or recently deceased human donors and are further processed in tissue banks. Tissue banks have patented processes to remove almost 99% of bone marrow blood elements from the internal blood matrix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Allogenic grafts, however, carry the risk of rejection and infection.\n\n【15】The exact prevalence of allograft-associated bone graft infection is unknown. A single center allogenic bone bank study conducted in 2005 revealed infection rate of 1.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, updates in screening and bone graft testing have likely reduced the infection rate further. The American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have standardized screening and the testing procedure. Currently, all allograft samples must be collected aseptically in clean rooms. The harvested allograft samples then undergo further microbiological evaluation with HIV testing (antibodies as well as nucleic acid amplification test), hepatitis B (surface antigen, total antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, and nucleic acid amplification testing), hepatitis C (antibodies and nucleic acid amplification testing), and syphilis (treponemal or treponemal test) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【16】TB testing is, however, not included in the guidelines for allografts, and as such, our patient’s allograft was not tested for TB. Our patient had not travelled outside the United States and did not have any known risk factors for tuberculosis, such as prior incarceration or intravenous drug use. She obtained the infection from a contaminated lot of bone repair product, and several other patients from multiple states were infected, as was confirmed by CDC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In Pott’s disease, patients typically acquire spinal TB from a primary site of infection such as the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Our patient primarily had spinal TB from the bone graft and then subsequently developed disseminated TB, involving the lungs, representing the first case of “Reverse Pott’s Disease.”\n\n【17】Our patient also developed hyponatremia, likely from syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secondary to her TB infection. Hyponatremia is seen in 51% of patients with pulmonary TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. SIADH has been linked to TB, and subsequent hyponatremia with reports dates back to 1965 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Hyponatremia also has a similar prevalence (45%) in TB meningitis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In TB meningitis cases, both SIADH and cerebral salt wasting have been noted to be the cause of hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Another plausible explanation for hyponatremia is adrenal tuberculosis. Our patient did not have hypotension or associated hyperkalemia. Her cortisol level was appropriately elevated at 30 μg/dL. Our patient’s CT abdomen/pelvis was negative for adrenal pathology. Moreover, TB-associated adrenalitis typically presents after almost 90% of the adrenals are destroyed and can take 2–4 years following disease onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Our patient’s sodium levels also improved from 117 mmol/L to 126 mmol/L gradually with fluid restriction. In summary, our patient’s elevated cortisol levels and lack of hypotension and hyperkalemia makes adrenal TB unlikely and points to SIADH as the likely culprit.\n\n【19】Our patient was successfully treated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and levofloxacin. Levofloxacin was used instead of ethambutol due to better bone and CSF penetration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. She was also treated with dexamethasone for her meningitis. All hospital partners and family members who encountered the patient were tested for TB as per CDC recommendations. Our case highlights the potential benefit of standardizing TB testing in allografts. A study published in 2007 reviewed 15 years of data from 27840 allograft heart valve tissues. These allografts were stained for TB, but all were negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The cost associated with tuberculosis treatment, however, per patient in the USA is estimated to be $17,000 (non-multidrug-resistant TB), $134,000 (multidrug-resistant TB), and $430,000 (extensively drug-resistant TB) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The cost versus benefit analysis of allograft TB testing is an area that certainly needs more investigation.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】In conclusion, we present the first case of disseminated TB infection from a contaminated bone graft. Eventhough the incidence of TB from bone graft is low, the high morbidity and mortality associated with TB, the cost of treatment, and the high contagion risk in the event of a potential TB infection make standardizing allograft TB screening a notion that needs further research and discussion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:13", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:24", "cost": 11.344}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:13"}

We report two cases of reoperation as a result of raised ICP associated with cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity, one arising after glioma resection and the other after meningioma resection. In both cases, a “valve”-like structure was noted intraoperatively in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity. Surgical resection of the “valve”-like structure led to slow regression over several months after the reoperation rather than to immediate disappearance of the cyst. Both cases illustrate that the “valve”-like structure formed in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity may be responsible for cyst formation. Surgical resection of it provides good long-term outcomes in such patients though short-term outcomes are unsatisfactory; we speculate that if the resection of the cortical tissue around the “valve”-like structure is enough wide, its return may be avoided.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is common in patients undergoing intracranial tumor resection. Reoperation as a result of raised ICP is an important prognostic factor, often resulting in a poor outcome. Raised ICP associated with intracranial tumor resection frequently arises as a result of hemorrhage in the tumor resection cavity, peritumoral cerebral contusion, cerebral edema, and/or hemorrhage at adjacent or remote sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In contrast, reoperation as a result of raised ICP secondary to cyst formation in an intracranial tumor resection cavity is a rare clinical condition. In a retrospective analysis of 4,782 patients with intracranial tumor undergoing surgical treatment at our hospital over the past 10 years, we identified 98 patients who underwent reoperation owing to high ICP, and two of them developed high ICP as a result of cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity. Herein, we report the two cases, one arising as a result of repeated cyst formation in the tumor cavity after resection of temporal lobe glioma and the other after resection of sphenoid ridge meningioma. We also discuss the potential mechanisms underlying cyst formation in the intracranial tumor resection cavity.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【6】A 44-year-old female patient with a 1-year history of paroxysmal dizziness presented with an exacerbation of dizziness and nausea for 5 days. Physical examination revealed that she had poor memory and computation abilities without other focal neurological signs. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her head revealed a large zone of slightly elongated T1 or shortened T2 signal in her right temporal lobe. After administration of contrast agent, the lesion showed patchy heterogeneous enhancement or ring enhancement . A diagnosis of glioma was considered preoperatively. Surgery was performed via a right frontotemporal approach. Intraoperatively, a pink-purple tumor was noted on the surface of the temporal lobe near the sylvian fissure. The tumor was closely attached to the dura mater, with a soft texture and a rich blood supply. Under an operation microscope, the tumor tissue located adjacent to the sylvian fissure was excised, and a 4 cm cortical incision (as shown in the elliptical area in Figure 1(a)) was made in the sylvian fissure. Further intraoperative exploration showed that the blood supply to the tumor was provided by small branches of the middle cerebral artery. After separating the tumor along the perisylvian region and severing its feeding arteries, the tumor was resected in a piecemeal fashion. The cortical tissue located on the surface of the temporal lobe was not resected (the extent of tumor resection was limited to the elliptical area shown in Figure 1(b)). Surgicel (Ethicon, Inc. a Johnson & Johnson company; Somerville, NJ) was applied to cover the operative field to prevent exudation. The surgery was uneventful, and no openings were found in the cerebral ventricle. Pathological examination demonstrated that the tumor was a grade III oligodendroastrocytoma. The patient recovered well after surgery.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Imaging results for Case 1 . (a) Contrast-enhanced MRI showing heterogeneous or ring-like enhancement in the temporal lobe.

She had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 7. The patient received 250 ml of 20% mannitol and 40 mg of furosemide immediately to lower ICP. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her head revealed a hypodense area in the tumor resection cavity in the right temporal lobe, which led to deformation and dislocation of the surrounding tissue and the cerebral ventricle. Therefore, cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity was indicated . Emergency exploratory surgery was then performed. After incising the dura mater, it was found that the cerebral tissue had an elevated tension. A “valve”-like structure was formed by relocated cerebral tissue, Surgicel, and the arachnoid in the roof region of the tumor cavity, sealing the effusion in the tumor resection cavity (the position of the “valve”-like structure is shown by the arrow in Figure 1(c)). After separating the arachnoid and removing the Surgicel to open the tumor resection cavity, approximately 40 ml of clear, nonyellow liquid was aspirated. As a response to tension reduction, the cerebral tissue collapsed. No communication between the tumor resection cavity and the cerebral ventricle was found. The tumor resection cavity was then washed repeatedly, and the bone flap was returned to its initial location. Postoperative CT reexamination revealed that the space-occupying effect was absent, the roof region of the tumor resection cavity was open, and the “valve”-like structure had disappeared (as shown by the arrow in Figure 1(d)).\n\n【9】Five days after the reoperation, the patient again developed symptoms of high ICP and cerebral hernia. Repeat CT showed a recommencement of effusion in the tumor resection cavity and resealing of the roof region of the tumor resection cavity, suggesting possible reformation of the “valve”-like structure . A second reoperation was performed to aspirate the effusion at which the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern were fully separated, the “valve”-like structure resected, and the relocated cortex marsupialized so that the tumor resection cavity could communicate with the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern and the effusion could enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation. Surgicel was not applied this time. Considering that the patient developed cerebral hernia after both operations, the bone flap was removed. The patient recovered well after the second reoperation.\n\n【10】One week later, a CT rescan of her head demonstrated that there was still effusion in the tumor resection cavity, and it was possible that the “valve”-like structure had reformed again . But because the compression on the surrounding tissue was not severe, and considering that the bone flap had been removed and radiotherapy had low risk, the patient was given Gamma Knife therapy immediately after discharge from hospital. Three months later, CT examination showed that the cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity had disappeared, and the tumor had not recurred .\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【12】A 60-year-old women with a 2-month history of decreased memory presented with an exacerbation and nonfluent speech over the previous month. Physical examination revealed that she had incomplete motor aphasia without other focal neurological signs. An MRI scan of her head revealed a gourd-like area in the left frontotemporal region that spanned the anterior and middle cranial fossa. This abnormal area had a well-demarcated boundary, appearing as a slightly hypointense signal on the T1-weighted image, and as mixed isointense, slightly hyperintense and hypointense signals on the T2-weighted image. The left cerebral ventricle had become narrow as a result of compression. After contrast administration, the lesion showed heterogeneous enhancement . A diagnosis of sphenoid ridge meningioma was considered preoperatively and surgery was performed via a left extended pterional approach. After opening the dura mater, it was found that the grooves of the cerebral cortex near the sylvian fissure had become shallow and showed a pale yellow color. Under an operation microscope, the sylvian fissure was separated, and the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus were retracted to expose the yellowish-white tumor. After partially separating the tumor along its periphery, it was found that the basal part of the tumor was located mainly in the sphenoid ridge and partly at the base of the anterior and middle cranial fossa. Blood supply to the tumor was provided by the small branches of the middle cerebral artery. After severing the feeding arteries, the tumor was totally resected in a piecemeal fashion. The basal dura mater was coagulated following surgery. After the tumor removal, Surgicel was applied to cover the tumor cavity. The surgery was uneventful. Pathological examination demonstrated that the tumor was a meningioma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Imaging results for Case 2 . (a)-(b) MRI showing sphenoid ridge meningioma.

However, her condition deteriorated 6 days after the operation. She developed somnolence, mydriasis of her left eye, right limb paralysis, and pathological reflex and had a GCS score of 7, suggesting the formation of a cerebral hernia. To lower ICP, the patient was given 250 ml of 20% mannitol immediately. An emergency CT scan of her head showed a patchy mixed density (mainly hypodensity) area in the tumor resection cavity adjacent to the temporal lobe. The ipsilateral cerebral ventricle was deformed as a result of compression, and the midline structure had shifted toward the right side, suggesting cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity. A band-shaped hyperintense shadow was noted in the intracranial subdural space, in which some shadows of gas density were scattered . Emergency exploratory surgery was performed. After removing a small epidural hematoma and incising the dura mater, it was found that a “valve”-like structure had formed by relocated cerebral tissue, Surgicel, and the arachnoid. The location of the “valve”-like structure was along the sylvian fissure between the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus after the sphenoid ridge (the position of the “valve”-like structure is near the arrow shown in Figure 2(c)) the length along the sylvian fissure was about 5 cm. After separating the arachnoid and removing the Surgicel to open the tumor resection cavity, a virtually clear effusion was noted in the tumor resection cavity in the sylvian cistern. Approximately 30 ml of the effusion was aspirated. As a result, cerebral tissue tension decreased, and the cerebral pulse was good. Subsequent examination revealed that a few blood clots were attached to the base of the tumor resection cavity. After removing the blood clots, no communication was found between the tumor cavity and the cerebral ventricle or cerebral cistern. Subsequently, the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern were fenestrated, and marsupialization of the relocated cerebral tissue was performed so that the tumor resection cavity could communicate with the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern and the effusion could enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation. The tumor resection cavity was then washed repeatedly, and the bone flap was returned to its initial location. No Surgicel was applied during the second operation.\n\n【15】One week later, a CT rescan of her head revealed return of effusion in the tumor resection cavity, and it was possible that the “valve”-like structure had reformed again. But the roof region of the tumor resection cavity had become wider than before (as shown by the arrow in Figure 2(d)). Since compression on the surrounding cerebral tissue was not severe, a conservative approach was adopted. Ten months later, MRI examination showed that the cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity had disappeared, and the tumor had not recurred .\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Reoperation after intracranial tumor resection is common in patients with cerebral retraction-induced cerebral edema, cerebral contusion, and/or intracranial hemorrhage, especially in patients with skull base tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. However, raised ICP or cerebral herniation as a result of the space-occupying effect of cyst formation in a tumor cavity after intracranial tumor resection is rarely encountered in clinical practice. In our retrospective analysis, we found that, among patients undergoing reoperation owing to high intracranial pressure, the rate of reoperation as a result of high intracranial pressure secondary to cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity was approximately 2%. Although intracranial tumor resection cavities filled with fluid are not unusual in patients with large intracranial tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, they often spontaneously diminish or even disappear after cerebral compression is relieved by tumor resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Cyst formation in an intracranial tumor resection cavity is very rare.\n\n【18】After intracranial tumor resection, a pale yellow liquid may be produced by the residual tumor or wound surface and accumulate in the tumor resection cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Such accumulation may occur at an early (average 5.6 weeks) or late (average 3.6 years) stage after tumor resection. Although the space-occupying effect may occur, reoperation owing to development of cerebral hernia is rare. Even if surgery is needed, the prognosis is good, and no repeat cyst formation has been noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In cases 1 and 2 , the liquid aspirated from the tumor resection cavity had a nonyellow color, and cyst formation occurred 3 and 6 days after surgery, respectively, significantly shorter than periods reported in the literature. More importantly, cyst formation recurred rapidly after surgery and regressed over several months. These findings are inconsistent with previous reports mentioned above, suggesting the possible existence of other mechanisms. Cyst formation may also be caused by inflow and accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the tumor resection cavity as a result of communication with the cerebral ventricle or cistern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Although the tumors in both case 1 and case 2 were close to the temporal and frontal horns of the lateral ventricle, intraoperative examination and postoperative imaging revealed no communication between the tumor resection cavity and the cerebral ventricle. If communication occurs, the accumulated fluid in the tumor resection cavity may flow back to the cerebral ventricle, which may not give rise to raised ICP. Therefore, the possibility that cyst formation is caused by communication between the tumor resection cavity and the cerebral ventricle can be excluded.\n\n【19】So what mechanism caused the cyst formation? In case 1 , an intracerebral operation was performed to remove the temporal lobe glioma. In case 2 , resection of the sphenoid ridge meningioma was conducted in the space between cerebral tissue and the dura mater at the skull base; therefore this procedure was an extracerebral operation. Despite large differences in clinical characteristics and surgical procedures, repeated cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity was noted in both cases. Of note, both patients had a large tumor and a large tumor cavity after tumor resection. Exploratory surgery revealed that a “valve”-like structure had formed by relocated cerebral tissue, Surgicel, and the arachnoid in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity. Furthermore, we also found that the liquid aspirated from the tumor cavity had the properties of the cerebrospinal fluid. We therefore surmise that the “valve”-like structure may only permit unidirectional flow of cerebrospinal fluid. When raised ICP occurred, the cerebrospinal fluid entered into the tumor resection cavity via the “valve”-like structure which then sealed the tumor resection cavity, so preventing the effusion from entering the cerebrospinal fluid circulation and resulting in accumulation of liquid in the tumor resection cavity to produce a space-occupying effect. This is similar to the mechanism responsible for the formation of subdural hygroma or iatrogenic cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–14\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Rao reported a case of an expanding iatrogenic cyst following temporal lobectomy. In that case, it was proposed that a ball valve obstruction to flow of CSF occurred at the trigone. Ventricular CSF outflow would be forced into the cyst with the increased pressure of respiratory inspiration and cardiac systolic pulses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Kutlay et al. reported a case with iatrogenic arachnoid cyst with distinct clinical picture as a result of bone defect in the floor of the middle cranial fossa, in the case with time CSF entrapment in iatrogenic cyst, which supported the probable existence of a valvular mechanism, leading to the progressive accumulation of fluid within the cyst. Additionally, the cyst itself might have acted as a conductor for transmitting the pulsatile forces of the brain and CSF, and this condition also contributed to enlargement of the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Thus, it is reasonable for us to speculate that the formation of the iatrogenic “valve”-like structure is responsible for cyst formation in the tumor cavity after intracranial tumor resection. The formation of such an unidirectional “valve”-like structure is presumably in part iatrogenic. As the cortical tissue located on the surface of the tumor was not resected, it may provide an anatomical basis for the formation of the “valve”-like structure .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Diagram showing the “valve”-like structure on the surface of the brain. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【22】To prevent return of the effusion in the tumor resection cavity after the reoperation, we aspirated the effusion in the tumor cavity, opened up the communication of the cavity with the surrounding subarachnoid space and cerebral cistern, resected the “valve”-like structure, and marsupialized relocated cerebral tissue so that the effusion could enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation. However, the immediate postoperative outcome was poor as effusion recommenced in the tumor resection cavity in both cases because of the reformation of the “valve”-like structure. What is the hypothesis about the fact that the cyst postoperatively returns despite the fact that the “valve”-like structure was resected? A retrospective image analysis revealed the presence of edema in the cerebral tissue surrounding the tumor resection cavity. After the “valve”-like structure was surgically resected, edema could push the cortex toward the place of the former “valve”-like structure, which made it reform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Therefore, we speculate that the “valve”-like structure may reform as a result of the presence of cerebral edema, and when the roof region of the tumor cavity remains very narrow, the effusion in the tumor resection cavity cannot enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, and so it builds up. Subsequent “valve”-like structures were weaker than the earlier ones, so as cerebral edema regresses, the anatomical mechanism underlying the formation of the “valve”-like structure diminishes, allowing the tumor cavity effusion to enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation efficiently and resolving the effusion.\n\n【24】Currently there are three main surgical options for the treatment of developmental and iatrogenic cysts: craniotomy with excision of the cyst membrane, CSF drainage (either from the cyst or from the lateral ventricle), and cyst fenestration by means of stereotactic or endoscopic techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–19\\]</u>. For the cases in this paper, the first option was not feasible because there was no cyst membrane to excise. It was also difficult to excise the cyst since it was not possible to resect the anatomical basis of the “valve”-like structure. Long-term CSF drainage was not possible either due to potential for infection. Thus craniotomy with resection of the “valve”-like structure was the best option, although in this paper the resection of brain tissue around the “valve”-like structure was not enough so that the roof region of the tumor cavity remained very narrow.\n\n【25】In case 1 , postoperative CT reexamination revealed the opening and resealing of the roof region of the tumor resection cavity, suggesting possible disappearance and reformation of the “valve”-like structure 通用删除1(英):<u>(as shown by the arrows in Figure 1)</u>. In case 2 , postoperative examination showed that the roof region of the tumor resection cavity became widened 通用删除1(英):<u>(as shown by the arrow in Figure 2)</u>, and cyst reformation was attenuated, suggesting that the effect produced by the “valve”-like structure is weakened. These imaging changes indirectly confirm our hypothesis that the “valve”-like structure is responsible for cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity. Thus, we speculate that resection of the cortical tissue located on the surface of the tumor to widen the roof region of the tumor resection cavity may avoid the formation of the “valve”-like structure.\n\n【26】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【27】In conclusion, we describe two cases of reoperation as a result of raised ICP owing to cyst formation in the tumor cavity following intracranial tumor resection. We hypothesize that the presence of a “valve”-like structure in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity is responsible for cyst formation in the cavity. Surgical resection of this and marsupialization of the cortex provide good long-term outcomes in such patients though short-term outcomes are unsatisfactory, and we speculate that if the resection of the cortical tissue around the “valve”-like structure is wide enough, the problem may be avoided.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:56:34", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:57:20", "cost": 46.887}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:57:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:56:33"}

Other than significant smoking history, the patient had been healthy with a recently treated case of uncomplicated pneumonia. The mass originated in the aortopulmonary window of the left mediastinum and invaded proximally into the left superior pulmonary vein and subsequently into the left atrium. The mass protrusion into the mitral valve occupied 50% of the left atrium space but showed no clinical symptoms of a valvular blockade. Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was identified upon biopsy. These findings of a primary lung tumor with atrial extension in an asymptomatic patient point to the importance of age-appropriate screening and standardization treatment modalities.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The evaluation of cardiac masses frequently presents diagnostic challenges due to a combination of their broad differential, imaging challenges, and rarity, with a prevalence of 0.001 to 0.03% of primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, and a 20–40 higher incidence of secondary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. When the tumor is an extension of lung cancer, there is no standardized approach to its management. Still, typically surgical resection is more common if there exists an intra-atrial extension of tumor thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We present a case of a rare presentation of lung cancer in an asymptomatic healthy female patient found to have a tumor thrombus originating in the pulmonary veins and extending into the left atrium.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient is a 67-year-old previously healthy female with a 55 pack-year smoking history presented with an indication of a mediastinal mass that was incidentally found on a chest radiograph when she developed pneumonia that resolved without complications several months prior. She denied any weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats. After 30 years of not being seen by a healthcare provider, she subsequently established with a primary care physician. At that time, age-appropriate cancer screening was initiated, including a low-dose CT (computed tomography) scan of the thorax, which identified a 19 × 21 mm nodule, left hilar lymphadenopathy, and intralobular septal thickening in the left upper lobe  suspicious for pulmonary venous obstruction.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Screening chest CT scan that originally identified the 19 × 22 mm nodule in the left upper lobe of the lung (red circle). Left hilar adenopathy was also noted on presentation (yellow circle). Intralobular septal thickening was also noted.</u>\n\n【7】On direct admission to the hospital for further workup of the pulmonary mass, the patient was hemodynamically stable during the admission with stable vitals and moderate hypertension of 150/90 mmHg. CT Thorax with contrast verified a mass in the aortopulmonary window measuring 3.3 × 2.4 cm  and extending proximally into the left superior pulmonary veins and subsequently the left atrium . Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 61% with a 3.0 cm × 1.6 cm mobile echo density with a poorly defined variegated surface visualized in the left atrium attached to the roof of the atrium . The hypoechoic mass moves slightly with the cardiac cycle but remains within the left atrium. The mass appears to be projecting in from the right pulmonary vein but is not clearly defined. In some echocardiographic views, the mass occupies more than 50% of the left atrium and has an undulating thrombus on the surface of the tumor.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CT thorax with contrast sagittal (a) and coronal (b) representative views of the patient’s mass measuring 3.3 × 2.4 cm.

An adrenal mass was incidentally found on CT abdomen and follow-up MRI abdomen with contrast established; it was a benign adrenal adenoma. Clinically, the patient appeared healthy and did not have any symptoms or imaging findings suggestive of metastatic disease. The patient reported no weight loss, fevers, chills, changes in appetite, chest pain, or SOB. The patient’s complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic profile (BMP) were unremarkable, except for mild hypokalemia of 3.2. A multidisciplinary approach was utilized: neurology for assessing anticoagulation and stroke prevention due to tumor thrombus involvement: thoracic/cardiac surgery for surgical evaluation; pulmonary for tumor evaluation and management; and interventional radiology for sample biopsy. Interventional radiology CT-guided percutaneous biopsy obtained a pathology sample of the left hilar mass that was identified as a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor cells had an immune profile that was supportive of thymic origins with positive staining for cytokeratin ae1/ae3, CAM5.2, p63, CD5 (patchy), CD117 (focal and patchy), and negative staining for PAX-8, napsin, TTF-1, CK7, CK20, S100, synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CDX-2 .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Histological sections of the left hilar mass.

This immunoprofile is supportive of a thymic origin and was diagnosed as poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. There were not enough tissues to perform ancillary molecular studies.</u>\n\n【12】After discussing with multiple disciplines (radiation, medical oncology, and surgery teams), the plan was to initiate inpatient chemotherapy with concurrent radiation therapy. The patient was transferred to the oncology inpatient service for further management. Her final staging was T4N3M0, Stage 3C. Evaluation by the surgical specialties deemed the tumor to be nonresectable due to location and complexity. As such, following the data obtained from the Pacific trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, the patient was subsequently started on 6000 cGy radiation with concurrent turbotaxol and subsequently followed up with one year of durvalumab. On patient follow-up visits two months after initiating therapy, she is tolerating treatments with minimal adverse effects. Follow-up CT thorax demonstrates a decreased lung mass down to 16mm × 8mm (from 19 × 22 mm).\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】The most common causes of intracardiac tumors are hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Urgent evaluation and complete staging are essential aspects of management with cardiac CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the most commonly used methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the case of our patient, the workup was all negative. Ultimately a biopsy was obtained, which determined the mass as a Stage IIIC squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with possible thymic origins. What makes this case unique is the asymptomatic presentation of a sizeable nonobstructive mass in an otherwise healthy female patient of relatively young age compared to previous case reports with typical age ranging from the mid-70s to mid-80s.\n\n【15】Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and is responsible for most cancer-related deaths in the US and worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Lung cancer invasion into the heart is a rare phenomenon, with only a few reported cases worldwide in the last decade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 7–10\\]</u>. Most of these cases present with symptomatic patients to varying degrees, from the potential of embolization causing stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, bowel infarction, and ischemic leg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> to the left ventricular outlet obstruction resulting in sudden death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. There is still no standardized approach to such masses given these devastating complications, although surgery before chemotherapy is generally advocated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In our case, a healthy female patient in her mid-60s presented with an asymptomatic mediastinal mass and a mobile echo density in the left atrium. On TTE, the mass is fairly large with a poorly defined structure, unlike cardiac myxomas. Our initial differential was broad and included anatomical variations, implantable devices, thrombus, vegetations or other infectious etiologies, traumatic scar (patient had a car accident history), artifacts, and tumors. Among tumors, lung cancer has the highest incidence of metastasis to the heart, followed by breast cancer, malignant melanoma, leukemia, and malignant lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. Additionally, on the differential were myxomas, fibromas, and rhabdomyomas. Due to the tumor’s extension, we also suspected sarcoma as a malignant tumor source. Lastly, metastatic workup included CT, MRI, and NM bone scans returned negative; the diagnosis ultimately depended on the biopsy result. A biopsy of the left hilar mass was obtained with the help of interventional radiology, and subsequent staining was completed.\n\n【17】Due to the number of possible complications that can arise from the mass and its associated treatment, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to identify and classify the tumor and its subsequent therapy steps. The tumor was classified as T4N3M0, Stage IIIC, due to the lack of distant metastasis. The thymic origins suggested possible lymphoma, but after reviewing the histological slides, the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or NSCLC was made, and treatment was planned accordingly. Under the current NCCN guidelines, the patient was treated with chemoradiation per the Pacific trials and will be evaluated for surgical candidacy in the future. At the time of this manuscript submission, the patient is doing well and is tolerating her treatments. Tumor shrinkage was noted on chest CT after two months of therapy. This presentation helps to signify the importance of age-appropriate lung cancer screening with low-dose CT in those with significant smoking history, which recently has been shown to have evidence-based mortality reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】Lung cancer with tumor thrombus can be a rare and severe complication with involvement of the left atrium. Especially with debilitating complications like stroke and infarction, it becomes prudent for age-appropriate screening and early detection of these tumors. The prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung presenting as tumor thrombus in the left atrium is a rarity. Therefore, we need further studies to learn about more multidisciplinary team management strategies and treating such masses.

Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed disruption of IS/OS junction with expansion of abnormal hyperreflectivity from retinal pigment epithelium to the outer nuclear layer (ONL). One month later fundus examination showed disappearance of the lesions. FA revealed transmission hyperfluorescence. FAF showed increased autofluorescence and pigment clumping. Hyperreflective band in SD-OCT disappeared. Loss of photoreceptor segment layers was observed in some of the macular lesions. The diagnosis of acute retinal pigment epitheliitis can be challenging after disappearance of fundus findings. FA, FAF, and SD-OCT are important tests for diagnosis after resolution of the disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Acute retinal pigment epitheliitis (ARPE), which is first described by Krill and Deutman 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, is a self-limiting disease of unknown aetiology typically affecting healthy young adults. The disease is characterized by acute onset of visual symptoms (blurred vision, central/paracentral scotomas, and metamorphopsia) which resolve without treatment within 6 to 12 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The diagnosis usually depends on symptoms and fundus examination findings. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA) are ancillary tests which give us an understanding for the exact spatial location of the disrupted retinal layer. Fundus findings include small areas of fine pigment stippling surrounded by hypopigmented yellow-white haloes in the macular region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–9\\]</u>. OCT reveals disruption of the photoreceptors inner segment and outer segment (IS-OS) junction in association with a hyperreflective band 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–11\\]</u>. The hypopigmented areas show transmission hyperfluorescence without leakage on FA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 6–9, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Herein we report SD-OCT, FA, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) findings of a patient diagnosed with ARPE.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 17-year-old man presented with a complaint of central and paracentral scotomas in his right eye for 1 week. There was no remarkable medical or ocular history. Blood analyses were within normal range. Slit-lamp examination result was normal. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20. Fundus examination revealed vertically aligned yellow-white hypopigmented areas involving superior, inferior, and central macular regions. Other hypopigmented areas were noticed superotemporally. Fine pigment stippling was detected only in the foveola . No sign of vitritis was seen. Early phase of the FA showed hypofluorescence corresponding to hypopigmented areas that were surrounded by a ring of hyperfluorescence . Hyperfluorescence increased due to staining at the late phase of the FA . FAF was slightly increased in the hypopigmented areas . SD-OCT showed disruption of IS/OS junction with expansion of abnormal hyperreflectivity from RPE to the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in superior and inferior lesions . Inferior lesion which was larger showed inner RPE disruption. Foveolar lesion showed RPE irregularities with minimal disruption of IS/OS junction .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Fundus photography demonstrating vertically aligned yellow-white hypopigmented areas involving superior (orange arrow), inferior (white arrow), and central foveal regions (arrow head) and other hypopigmented areas superotemporally.

Hypopigmented areas slightly disappeared . FA showed increased hyperfluorescence surrounding the hypofluorescent areas compared to initial FA . Late phase of the FA showed further increase in hyperfluorescence due to late staining . FAF showed increased autofluorescence and pigment clumping . SD-OCT demonstrated disappearance of the hyperreflective band involving the ONL and the photoreceptor segment layers, loss of photoreceptor segment layers, and RPE irregularities in the superior lesion . The hyperreflective band persisted but became smaller in size in the inferior lesion . Foveolar lesion remained the same with scarce RPE irregularities .\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Fundus photography demonstrating slightly disappeared hypopigmented spots one week later.

At the late phase FA, hyperfluorescence slightly increased due to late staining . Pigment clumping and autofluorescence significantly increased in FAF . Hyperreflective bands disappeared in all of the lesions. In the superior and inferior lesions loss of photoreceptor segment layers was observed with slightly irregular RPE .

Discussion\n\n【14】ARPE is an acute, self-limiting disease of unknown aetiology. It typically affects healthy young adults. The pathogenesis and aetiology are still unclear. Although there were reports about FA and SD-OCT characteristics of the lesions, from the time Krill and Deutman described the disease entity, only a few case reports were published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–10, 12, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Chittum and Kalina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> described FA findings as transmission hyperfluorescence without leakage seen in the hypopigmented areas. Several reports also showed transmission hyperfluorescence in the FA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 6–9, 12\\]</u>. Our FA findings changed over time. FA initially showed early hypofluorescent areas later stained in a halo pattern. Eventually FA findings became more prominent and beginning from the early phase of the fluorescein angiography transmission hyperfluorescence without leakage was observed in the corresponding hypopigmented areas. FA findings can be variable at different stages of the disease. Recognition of different FA findings is important for accurate diagnosis.\n\n【16】Hsu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> was first to describe the SD-OCT findings and reported abnormal increased reflectivity involving the ONL and the RPE with absence of intraretinal, subretinal, or sub-RPE fluid. Our patient’s SD-OCT findings included disruption of IS/OS junction with expansion of abnormal hyperreflectivity from RPE to the ONL especially in the superior and inferior lesions. Hypopigmented lesion in the fovea showed a slight disruption of IS/OS junction with mild RPE irregularities. The lesion in the fovea almost fully recovered in a month when compared to other lesions in which loss of photoreceptor layer was seen after resolution of the hyperreflective bands. This finding could be the result of varied degrees of involvement in different areas of macula.\n\n【17】There are only a few reports mentioning FAF. In some reports autofluorescence measurement was normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 10\\]</u>. Increased autofluorescence with pigmented dots was also detected in corresponding areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In our case fundus autofluorescence findings altered during follow-up. Initially slightly increased autofluorescence was detected. After disappearance of the lesion in the fundus examination, FAF showed increased autofluorescence and pigment clumping. Changes seen in RPE layer are usually permanent in ARPE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. FAF is an important tool for diagnosis even after disease recovery.\n\n【18】Increased autofluorescence and pigment clumping were detected in the areas of photoreceptor layer loss and RPE changes. Both SD-OCT and fundus autofluorescence findings showed us involvement of ONL has worse prognosis causing loss of photoreceptor layer when compared to slight disruption of IS/OS junction and RPE irregularities which recovered almost completely.\n\n【19】The pathogenesis of the disease is still unclear. Hsu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> hypothesized that primary inflammation could involve photoreceptors causing a secondary subacute response in the RPE. Recently Cho et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> suggested that the initial lesion in acute retinal pigment epitheliitis located at the junction between the photoreceptor outer segments and the apical sides of the RPE cells. In our patient the more severely affected lesions involved the outer nuclear layer, photoreceptor segment layer, and RPE inner layer. Less severe lesion caused RPE irregularities and only a slight disruption of IS/OS junction. In the light of this finding it can be suggested that initial lesion is located at the RPE or junction between the RPE and the photoreceptor outer segments.\n\n【20】ARPE can be recognized with FA, FAF, and SD-OCT findings even after the lesions seen in fundus examination were resolved.

The oncologic surgery of a proximal femur osteosarcoma affecting the hip joint can be very challenging. We present an 8-year-old boy with a 5-month history of right hip pain. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a lytic lesion of the proximal femur extending 13 cm to the diaphysis. Histological evaluation was consistent with high-grade osteoblastic osteosarcoma. After completing chemotherapy we performed an extra-articular resection of the hip. Reconstruction was accomplished by reimplanting the acetabulum after irradiation and modular proximal femur megaprosthesis. Endoprosthetic reconstruction following proximal femur resection is a good treatment alternative achieving good postoperative function. Extra-articular resection of the hip using a periacetabular osteotomy technique enabled us to achieve wide margins and leave an intact posterior column to optimize acetabular reconstruction stability. Extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation is a valuable treatment option in a situation such as this where allograft geometric fit is a priority. We conclude that an extra-articular resection of the hip, followed by reconstruction with an extracorporeally irradiated acetabulum and a proximal femur modular megaprosthesis, is a useful combined treatment option for malignant lesions involving the hip joint, especially in paediatric patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone, with an incidence of 2.4% among childhood cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Osteosarcoma commonly occurs in the long bones, near the metaphyseal growth plates; the femur is the most frequently involved bone. Articular cartilage acts as a relative barrier to tumor spread, and extension into the hip joint is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The management of a proximal femur malignant lesion with intra-articular involvement is challenging. The need for adequate excision margins and the anatomical complexity of the pelvis mean that reconstruction procedures are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, as well as poor functional outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】We present an unreported case of proximal femur osteosarcoma with intra-articular involvement, treated with extra-articular resection of the hip, reconstructed with an irradiated acetabulum structural autograft and proximal femur modular megaprosthesis replacement.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】We present a case of a previously healthy 8-year-old boy with a 5-month history of intermittent right hip and knee pain. The patient suffered a nondisplaced pathological femoral neck fracture, treated at another centre with closed reduction and internal fixation using two K wires. After two months of follow-up without clinical or radiological signs of fracture healing, the patient was referred to our centre. Plain radiographs of the pelvis, hip, and proximal femur showed mixed osteolytic and sclerotic areas at the right proximal femur and an unhealed femoral neck fracture fixed with two K wires . Suspecting a primary bone tumor, an open biopsy was performed and the K wires were removed. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a proximal femur lesion extending distally 13 cm, with a surrounding soft-tissue mass. MRI also showed joint effusion, though there was no evidence of acetabular extension . Histological evaluation was consistent with high-grade osteoblastic osteosarcoma. A chest CT scan and a bone scintigraphy did not show metastasis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the Erasmus 1 Trial protocol (Methotrexate, Adriamycin, and Cisplatin) was initiated and completed without incident.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Plain radiographs of the pelvis, hip, and proximal femur showing mixed osteolytic and sclerotic areas in the right proximal femur and an unhealed femoral neck fracture fixed with two K wires.

The iliac vessels and the femoral and sciatic nerves were exposed and mobilized. The intrapelvic portion of the psoas muscle was released and the gluteus maximus muscle was detached from the iliotibial band and femur. The external rotators of the hips were transected near their origins, and the vastus intermedius and lateralis were transected at the level of the femoral osteotomy.\n\n【10】A femoral osteotomy was made 16 cm distally from the tip of the greater trochanter, giving 3 cm of wide margin. The insertions of the adductors were transected from the proximal femur, followed by release of the gluteus medius and minimus. Subsequently an en bloc extra-articular resection of the acetabulum was performed, following the standard steps in a Bernese periacetabular osteotomy; the resected specimen was then transferred to a separate sterile trolley and moved away from the main operative field to avoid any contamination. Under aseptic precautions, a capsulectomy was made through the acetabulum rim, and samples of articular fluid and the proximal femur were sent for histological examination. Head size was measured for bipolar reconstruction. The acetabulum was placed in a sterile container and sent to the radiotherapy department for extracorporeal irradiation . The acetabulum segment, enclosed in a sterile pack, was irradiated to a dose of 50 Gy/1 fraction. Meanwhile we implanted a bipolar femoral modular megaprosthesis (Biomet OSS Compress) for proximal femoral reconstruction. Upon return to the operating room, the excised acetabulum was reimplanted and fixed with two reconstruction plates, achieving perfect geometric anatomic fit.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Following the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy, an en bloc extra-articular resection of the acetabulum was performed; the resected specimen was then transferred to a separate sterile trolley.

Microscopic tumor implantations were seen at the distal capsular insertions. Articular fluid cytology showed no evidence of tumor cells.\n\n【13】Postoperatively the patient was immobilized with a spica cast for a period of 12 weeks. Three weeks after the index procedure the patient developed a superficial wound dehiscence which required aggressive surgical debridement and lavage. Tissue cultures were positive for E. coli. The patient received a 6-week course of intravenous Ciprofloxacin followed by 12 weeks of oral Ciprofloxacin. The patient initiated non-weight-bearing ambulation at 6 weeks. Three months after surgery the patient was allowed to progressively bear weight. Radiographic follow-up showed correct integration of the autograft and prosthesis . Currently, after 18 months, the patient walks with the use of a cane and there is no evidence of infection or tumor recurrence.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 After 18 months of follow-up, a plain AP radiograph of the pelvis shows correct integration of the autograft and prosthesis.</u>\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Since the routine use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy began in the 1980s, limb salvage surgery reconstruction is generally the favored treatment option when managing extensive primary bone tumours, with limb salvage rates above 90% in most major centers. Endoprostheses have several advantages over biological reconstruction methods, being readily available in both custom-made and modular forms, initially reliable with low complication rates, and allowing rapid return to full weight bearing with predictable function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Endoprosthetic replacement following tumor resection is a good treatment option for proximal femoral malignant lesions, due to its low complication rate and good postoperative function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>; however, the management of a proximal femoral malignant lesion with intra-articular involvement is challenging, especially in pediatric patients. The resection of a tumor at the level of the proximal femur results in loss of abductors and other musculature necessary for hip stability. This often leads to a higher dislocation rate. Hip dislocation is a recognized problem after the use of megaprostheses, with rates of dislocation varying from 1.7% to around 28% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7, 8\\]</u>. To reduce the risk of dislocation in our case, we decided to use a bipolar hemiarthroplasty as it is inherently more stable than total hip replacement. We reattached the abductors to a surgical mesh and directly to the prosthesis attachment site.\n\n【18】Periacetabular en bloc resection of the pelvis (Enneking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> type II resection) including the anterior and posterior columns is the traditional treatment for malignant bone lesions affecting the hip joint, but this option may result in substantial loss of pelvic bone stock and compromise pelvic stability. Although several other reconstructive procedures have been reported, including pelvic prosthesis arthroplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–14\\]</u>, allograft reconstruction (with or without a total hip prosthesis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u> arthrodesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 17\\]</u>, and pseudarthrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, a gold standard has yet to be established owing to poor postoperative function and major complication rates ranging from 33% to 56%.\n\n【19】Rüdiger et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> described a posterior-column-preserving technique for the treatment of intra-articular malignant lesions, using the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy introduced in the 1980s by Ganz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> for the treatment of hip dysplasia. They reported two cases with intra-articular extension of a proximal femoral malignant lesion treated with extra-articular resection of the hip, reconstructed with a structural acetabular allograft and endoprosthetic replacement maintaining the continuity and stability of the pelvic ring. The use of the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy in our case had the main advantage of preserving the stability of the pelvic ring and also preserving a large bone contact area with intact vascular supply from the superior gluteal artery to the supra-acetabular and posterior column bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. Both facts contributed to early consolidation/integration of the irradiated graft and allowed increased loading of the hip and range-of-motion training 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Extracorporeal irradiation of autogenous timorous bone and its use for reimplantation was first described in 1968, by Spira and Lubin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Since then, extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation (ECI) has been used as a surgical limb salvage technique for musculoskeletal malignant lesions. The major advantages of this surgical technique are biological reconstruction, no risk of disease transmission or immunological reaction, ready availability, and preservation of bone stock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. A recently published case series of 30 malignant tumours treated with extracorporeal irradiation and posterior reimplantation reported 90% excellent and good results, with two cases of surgical failure, and a 10% infection rate as the main complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. In our case, although no evidence of tumor extension into the acetabulum was seen on MRI, there was extension into the capsule joint due to the pathological neck fracture. For this reason we considered the tumor as intra-articular and performed an extra-articular resection of the hip joint, in order to secure wide excision margins. Taking into account that we were treating a skeletally immature patient, we decided to reimplant the resected acetabulum after irradiation, in order to guarantee a perfect geometric match and because we did not have access to an acetabulum allograft of pediatric size.\n\n【21】The irradiation of the autologous acetabular graft in a skeletally immature patient may result in a premature fusion of the triradiate physeal cartilage. Fusion of the triradiate cartilage, as seen in young patients with pelvic or acetabular fractures, produces a disparate growth between the femoral head and the acetabulum, with subsequent incongruence of the hip joint resulting in subluxation of the femoral head, similar to the mechanism in developmental dysplasia of the hip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. In our case, although we reimplanted the autologous acetabular graft after extracorporeal irradiation, we replaced the proximal femur with a megaprosthesis, which should avoid future incongruence or mismatch between the prosthetic bipolar head and the acetabulum.\n\n【22】We conclude that an extra-articular resection of the hip using the Bernese periacetabular technique, followed by reconstruction with an extracorporeally irradiated acetabular autograft and a proximal femur modular megaprosthesis, is a useful combined treatment option for malignant femoral lesions involving the hip joint, especially in pediatric patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:28", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:42", "cost": 13.406}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:28"}

Neurosarcoidosis, either isolated or as part of systemic sarcoidosis, is an uncommon entity and has diagnostic uncertainty.

Neurosarcoidosis may further predispose patients to infections of the central nervous system. Case Presentation. A 54-year-old male with a history of probable neurosarcoidosis on methotrexate and infliximab presented with encephalopathy, hypoxia, and reported fevers. The patient was found to have disseminated histoplasmosis involving the lungs (miliary histoplasmosis), central nervous system (neurohistoplasmosis), and bloodstream. The Histoplasma capsulatum infection was treated with amphotericin and then voriconazole. Discussion. Patients with neurosarcoidosis are suspected to have blood-brain barrier dysfunction.

We present the case of a patient diagnosed with probable neurosarcoidosis who subsequently developed disseminated histoplasmosis with miliary histoplasmosis, central nervous system histoplasmosis (neurohistoplasmosis), and Histoplasma capsulatum bacteremia. In our review of the English medical literature, we did not identify any additional cases of extensive multisystem infection with Histoplasma capsulatum in a patient with neurosarcoidosis.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 54-year-old male with a history of probable neurosarcoidosis, lymphocytic leptomeningitis, seizures, cirrhosis, and possible ethanol use disorder presented with encephalopathy, hypoxia, and several weeks of reported intermittent fevers. For the treatment of neurosarcoidosis, he was taking mycophenolate 1000 mg orally twice a day and last received an infliximab infusion the month prior to presentation.\n\n【8】Approximately seventeen months prior to presentation, the patient underwent extensive investigation for ataxia, near syncope, and encephalopathy, during which he received empiric treatment for encephalitis with corticosteroids, although herpes simplex virus studies were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine from the cervical spinal cord to the lumbar spinal cord found leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) found 24 white blood cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (reference range 0–5 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) with 83% lymphocytes (reference range 0–60%), 8 red blood cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (reference range 0–0 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), glucose of 35 mg/dL (reference range 40–70 mg/dL), protein of 247.6 mg/dL (reference range 15–45 mg/dL), and no oligoclonal bands. Biopsies of the brain and meninges found leptomeningeal fibrosis with prominent arachnoid cap cells. Chest imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography found nonspecific pulmonary nodules and hilar lymphadenopathy. Additional unremarkable studies included bone marrow biopsies, lung biopsies, and sinus biopsies. No infectious pathogens, including Histoplasma, or neoplastic processes were identified.\n\n【9】Eleven months prior to presentation, the patient presented with encephalopathy. He was thought to have lymphocytic leptomeningitis. Serum and CSF angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) were normal. CSF studies found 21 white blood cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (no reference range) with 91% lymphocytes (no reference range), 1 red blood cell/mm<sup>3</sup> (no reference range), glucose of 39 mg/dL (50–70 mg/dL), and protein of 188 mg/dL (15–45 mg/dL). Investigations for infectious pathogens, including serum and CSF fungal studies such as for histoplasmosis, and neoplastic processes were negative. He received intravenous immunoglobulins and corticosteroids for an unclear autoimmune disease. A month later, his neurology providers thought his symptoms and studies were consistent with probable neurosarcoidosis and proceeded with treatment using mycophenolate and infliximab. Six months prior to presentation, he developed keratitis and uveitis.\n\n【10】Vital signs at presentation were temperature of 36.4°C, blood pressure of 80 mmHg/52 mmHg, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on 10 liters per minute of supplemental oxygen. Conventional chest radiography  found a diffuse miliary pattern, which was also identified on subsequent computed tomography of the chest. CSF studies found 1 white blood cell/mm<sup>3</sup> (no reference range) with 95% lymphocytes (no reference range), 1 red blood cell/mm<sup>3</sup> (no reference range), glucose of 28 mg/dL (50–70 mg/dL), and protein of 53 mg/dL (15–45 mg/dL).\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Conventional chest radiography obtained at the initial presentation found a diffuse miliary pattern.

He underwent endotracheal intubation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was extubated approximately one week later. Urine, serum, and CSF antigen studies were positive for histoplasmosis and blastomycosis, but the positive studies for blastomycosis were thought to be secondary to cross-reactivity. Respiratory culture obtained via bronchoscopy grew Histoplasma capsulatum. Fungal blood culture grew Histoplasma capsulatum. Bone marrow biopsy, obtained after the administration of antibacterial and antifungal agents, found hemophagocytosis that was thought to be consistent with the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis, although the bone marrow culture had no growth of pathogens. For treatment of disseminated histoplasmosis, he completed a course of amphotericin, was briefly on itraconazole, and was transitioned to voriconazole, on which he was eventually discharged after a month-long hospitalization. Pneumocystis jirovecii polymerase chain reaction study of the bronchoalveolar lavage was positive for which he received a complete course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, although suspicion for pneumocystis pneumonia was low. The patient’s hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury, aspiration pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】This patient was diagnosed with probable neurosarcoidosis. Evidence of systemic sarcoidosis in this patient included hilar lymphadenopathy and a history of uveitis and keratitis, although these findings do not conform to all the proposed criteria of Zajicek et al. for the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 10\\]</u>. Central nervous system studies suggestive of neurosarcoidosis included leptomeningeal enhancement, elevated proteins in the CSF, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 11\\]</u>. No oligoclonal bands were found. Serum ACE, which can be elevated in sarcoidosis, was normal. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> CSF ACE was normal but lacks clinical utility in the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. Extensive studies during multiple hospitalizations did not find alternative infectious and neoplastic pathologies to fully account for the patient’s symptoms and findings, thereby lending credence to neurosarcoidosis as a diagnosis of exclusion.

Clinicians should consider fungal studies and empiric antifungal treatment in patients with neurosarcoidosis on immunosuppressants.

In this report, we present a case of a 46-year-old patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who avoided insulin treatment due to associated peripheral edema. Though rare, this phenomenon is typically seen in patients with elevated glucose levels who are initiated on insulin treatment, resulting in rapid correction and tight control of glucose levels. The diagnosis of insulin-induced edema is made after other causes of acute edema are ruled out. Furthermore, in this case report, we will also discuss the postulated mechanisms for the edema-causing property of insulin.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Insulin edema syndrome is a rare complication of insulin therapy. Edema resulting from initiation of insulin therapy or intensification of glycemic control is an under-recognized complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This phenomenon has typically been described in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus during the initiation of insulin treatment, with rapid correction and tight control of glucose levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, the rarity and lack of awareness of this phenomenon creates challenges in establishing the prevalence, making an accurate diagnosis, and creating guidelines for treatment. We report a case of insulin edema during rapid correction and strict glucose control in a diabetic patient with poorly controlled glucose levels and elevated hemoglobin A1c level, with the goal of highlighting this complication, exploring the etiology and pathophysiology of insulin-related edema, and acknowledging it as a potential reason why patients decline insulin therapy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 46-year-old man with a medical history significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), recurrent pancreatitis, alcohol use disorder, and hypertension presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. His abdominal symptoms occurred intermittently for approximately three weeks prior to admission, during which time he had stopped using his insulin pump with continuous glucose monitoring after his device broke over two months ago. Ten days before his current admission, he was admitted to the hospital for diabetic ketoacidosis during which time he was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin and discharged on insulin detemir 8 units twice daily, insulin lispro 8 units 3 times daily with meals, calcium carbonate 750 mg every 6 hours, pancrelipase 12,000-unit capsule 3 times daily, sucralfate 10 ml four times daily, and trazodone 50 mg tablet nightly. He reported stopping the use of his insulin because he believed it was causing bilateral pedal edema to the level of his knees. He noted consistent patterns of developing edema in his lower extremities a few days after insulin administration. The patient stated that the swelling in his legs resolved after cessation of insulin use. During his hospital admission, the patient refused diabetes education and insisted on the side effect of insulin as a reason for non-compliance with treatment routine.\n\n【6】Social history was remarkable for 60 pack-year tobacco use, daily marijuana use, and no other illicit drug use. Review of systems was remarkable for recent weight loss due to poor diet, chronic smoker's cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, and lower extremity bilateral pedal edema present on days of insulin use that resolves when the patient does not use his insulin. He also reported having chronic diabetic neuropathy and numbness in his feet bilaterally.\n\n【7】Physical examination was notable for temperature of 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 151/76, heart rate of 88, respiratory rate of 20, and oxygen saturation of 98 percent on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal rate and regular rhythm, there was no elevated jugular venous pressure, and lung sounds were with no rales. He had generalized abdominal tenderness on palpation without guarding, rebound tenderness, or distension. There was bilateral pedal pitting 4+ edema up to his knees .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bilateral pedal edema to the level of the knees secondary to insulin therapy (photograph was taken with patient’s permission).</u>\n\n【9】Laboratory results were consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): anion gap of 23, bicarbonate of 11 mmol/L, sodium of 130 mmol/L, chloride of 93 mmol/L, creatinine of 0.41 mg/dL, glucose of 374 mg/dL, total protein of 5.4 g/dL, albumin of 3.4 g/dL, and positive beta hydroxybutyrate of 2.74, and urinalysis showed 1+ ketones and 3+ glucose and was negative for proteinuria. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was remarkable for scattered calcification along the atrophic pancreas suggesting chronic pancreatitis and normal liver texture. Lower extremity venous Doppler was not done due to lack of recent immobility, negative Homans’ sign, bilaterality, and low clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis. Transthoracic echo was unremarkable without any ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Insulin edema syndrome is an adverse effect of insulin therapy ensuing from the rigorous correction of hyperglycemia in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition to poor glycemic control, having a low body mass index increases the risk of developing insulin edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is also seen in younger patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus. The edema is generally mild, affecting the lower extremities. However, there have been reports of severe presentations causing anasarca, ascites, and pleural effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The cause of our patient’s insulin-dependent diabetes was believed to be secondary to his history of recurrent pancreatitis in the setting of alcohol abuse, also known as pancreatogenic diabetes or Type 3c 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Insulin edema may have variable presentations, from benign to frank heart or renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The edema has been postulated to result from several mechanisms, including increasing capillary permeability and renal salt retention, thus inducing extravasation of fluid, resulting in edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Insulin is known to cause the reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys by stimulating the Na<sup>+</sup>/K+-ATPase as well as expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 3 in the proximal tubule, and it also causes vasodilation, which contributes to fluid retention. Hyperglycemia independently also causes an increase in vascular permeability, which is consistent with the development of edema in patients that have persistently elevated glucose levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Persistently elevated glucose levels in diabetic patients cause poor integrity of the vascular membrane, which increases the risk of edema as a result of rapid serum osmolar changes. This proposed mechanism is supported by the phenomenon of “refeeding edema.” Refeeding edema occurs with an increase in endogenous plasma insulin associated with carbohydrate ingestion after prolonged starvation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】There are different approaches to treating insulin edema, ranging from conservative management with restriction of salt and liquid intake to pharmacotherapy with diuretics, epinephrine, or ephedrine in refractory cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Adjusting the dose of insulin has also been shown to reduce the degree of edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. As discussed above, the patient in this presentation noticed improvement of the leg swelling with cessation of insulin usage, which unfortunately resulted in his non-compliance and several sequelae of hospital admission as a result of DKA. During his admission, he received 20 mg of furosemide daily with rapid improvement in his symptoms.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【16】Insulin edema syndrome is a rare complication of insulin therapy. Appropriate patients who present with edema should have this clinical entity as an element in their differential diagnoses. Potential complications involving the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems should be considered. After other cardiac, hepatic, vascular, and nephrotic causes of sudden onset edema have been excluded, it is reasonable to attribute the etiology to this under-recognized phenomenon.

Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 19-year-old man ingested large amount of crack cocaine in a suicide attempt. He arrived in the emergency department unconscious and was intubated. After this, he had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation reversed with defibrillation. Repeated seizures were observed, and benzodiazepines were administered.\n\n【8】Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, prolonged PR and QTc interval (510 ms), widening of the QRS complex (200 ms), and increase in R wave amplitude in aVR (8.0 mV) and right ward of the terminal 40 ms (T40 ms) axis deviation in the frontal plane (210°), Figure 1(a).

Myocardial infarction and any structural cardiac involvement were ruled out because there was no electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemic injury, the dosage of troponin I was only slightly elevated, and the echocardiography was normal. He was discharged without neurological disabilities, and the electrocardiogram was normal.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】We described a case of severe crack cocaine overdose with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and repeated seizures in which an interesting electrocardiographic pattern similar to that found in tricyclic antidepressant poisoning was observed, and these alterations were completely reversed through the acidosis correction.\n\n【14】The classical electrocardiographic abnormalities observed in acute poisoning by tricyclic antidepressant are the widening of QRS; the increase in R wave amplitude in aVR, the QTc interval prolongation, the right-axis deviation of the terminal 40 ms vector of the QRS complex in the frontal plane, and the Brugada-like pattern. Many studies showed that these alterations can help identify patients with high risk of arrhythmia and seizure, mainly the prolongation of the QRS duration >100 ms. This last alteration predicts a higher risk of complications and is used as a formal indication for systemic sodium bicarbonate administration in many medical services 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【15】There are many descriptions of reversal of these electrocardiographic alterations through intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion during tricyclic antidepressant intoxication, and it is recognized as a standard treatment in this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. These electrocardiographic abnormalities are caused mainly by blocking the fast sodium channels; this effect is called “quinidine-like” because it is similar to that caused by the type I antidysrhythmic drugs.\n\n【16】The crack cocaine form is manufactured by processing the cocaine with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate to remove the hydrochloride, and in this way it is heat stable which allows it to be smoked 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our case, the patient used this drug in an unusual manner, because he ingested orally the crack cocaine in a suicide attempt.\n\n【17】Cocaine can block the fast sodium channels and theoretically trigger similar abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this case, the electrocardiographic alterations are probably due to potent sodium channel blockage slowing the cardiac conduction. Although cocaine can block other channels, like the potassium channel, this action is secondary during the clinical presentation, and this drug has a biphasic effect on cardiac repolarization causing a prolongation of the repolarization in a low concentration and a shortening of the repolarization in a high concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In our case, the patient ingested a large amount of cocaine, and we observed QTc interval prolongation; however, only the QRS prolongation caused by the sodium blockage was responsible for this alteration, since the JT interval was normal (280 ms) and remained unchanged after bicarbonate administration.\n\n【18】There are many descriptions of cocaine-related sudden death, but the majority of these patients die before arriving at the hospital, and the mechanisms responsible for these deaths are unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Ventricular arrhythmias as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation induced by the cocaine may be responsible for it; in our case ventricular fibrillation was observed which was promptly reversed by defibrillation. Wang described one case of a 25-year-old man with cardiac arrest resuscitated with epinephrine after the ingestion of crack cocaine who presented electrocardiographic alterations similar to those showed here that improved after sodium bicarbonate infusion; however, in this case arrhythmias and seizure were not described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】These life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias can be precipitated due to myocardial infarction or ischemia induced by the cocaine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>; but in our case, alterations compatible with acute coronary syndrome were not observed, and echocardiography was normal. Therefore, these alterations appear to be a direct local effect of the cocaine on the heart.\n\n【20】Acidosis can increase the toxic effect of the cocaine on the heart in that it increases the sodium channel blocking degree and decreases the conduction between the gap junctions, and, because of this, the acidosis correction is an important goal in the treatment of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Some reports have described the treatment of cocaine-induced arrhythmias with the administration of sodium bicarbonate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Jonsson et al. described an interesting case of cocaine overdose complicated by epileptics status, accelerated idioventricular rhythm associated with metabolic acidosis, and this arrhythmia was abated through the correction of the acidosis with bicarbonate infusion and ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Kerns et al. reported three cases of cocaine overdose with wide complex tachycardia; in one of these cases the rhythm disturbance resolved without direct treatment, but in the other two cases this arrhythmia resolved after intravenous bicarbonate infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【22】In our case, the cocaine-induced electrocardiographic alterations were reversed through the acidosis correction by sodium bicarbonate intravenous infusion and improved ventilation. Tricyclic antidepressant intoxication was actively ruled out in this case through the negative blood dosage.\n\n【23】There are some descriptions of transient Brugada-like pattern after cocaine and tricyclic antidepressant intoxication which is defined by right bundle branch block associated with coved ST-segment elevation in leads V1 and V2. In our case, we observed important alterations in cardiac conduction but not the Brugada-like pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Postresuscitative effects on the heart might have been responsible for some of these alterations, although this electrocardiographic pattern is not commonly observed in other situations of cardiac arrest, and in this case the patient was promptly resuscitated because the cardiac arrest happened during the initial medical evaluation.\n\n【25】The prevalence and prognostic of these electrocardiographic changes during cocaine overdose are unknown, but they could help identify patients at high risk of complications during this clinical setting, and the physicians need to suspect crack cocaine overdose in unconscious patients admitted to the hospital with electrocardiogram pattern compatible with sodium channel blocking.\n\n【26】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【27】The crack cocaine can induce an electrocardiographic pattern similar to that observed in acute poisoning by tricyclic antidepressants which is reversed by sodium bicarbonate infusion. These alterations may help identify patients at high risk of ventricular arrhythmia and seizure during crack cocaine overdose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:46:11", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:46:32", "cost": 20.597}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:46:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:46:11"}

For this reason, patients presenting with COVID-19 are often put on therapeutic or intermediate anticoagulation upon hospitalization. A common issue of this anticoagulation is the progression to hypocoagulability resulting in hemorrhage. Therefore, monitoring the hemostatic integrity of critically ill COVID-19 patients is of utmost importance. In this case series, we present the cases of three coagulopathic COVID-19 patients whose anticoagulation was guided by thromboelastography (TEG). In each case, TEG permitted the clinical team to simultaneously prevent thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, a difficult task for COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The first two cases illustrate the utility of TEG to guide anticoagulant dosing for COVID-19 patients when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is inaccurate. The first case was a severely ill COVID-19 patient with end-stage renal disease and a falsely elevated aPTT secondary to hypertriglyceridemia. The second case was a severely ill COVID-19 patient with chronic pulmonary disease who demonstrated a falsely elevated aPTT due to polycythemia and hemoconcentration. In both cases, TEG was sensitive to the hypercoagulability caused by the metabolic derangements which enabled the goal-directed titration of anticoagulants. The last case depicts a severely ill COVID-19 patient with an inherited factor V Leiden mutation who required abnormally high dosing to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation, guided by TEG. Hypercoagulopathic COVID-19 patients are difficult to anticoagulate without development of hypocoagulopathy. Treatment of these patients demands goal-directed therapy by diligent laboratory monitoring. This can be accomplished by the use of TEG coupled with aPTT to guide anticoagulation. This case series illustrates the necessity for active hemostatic monitoring of critically ill COVID-19 patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】There has been dispute regarding the anticoagulation of patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Initially, there was support for anticoagulation due to the high rates of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit, but standard doses of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin (UFH) may lead to hemorrhage in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>. A recent large United States trial regarding therapeutic anticoagulation of critically ill COVID-19 patients was discontinued because of the high rate of hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Determining a standard for anticoagulation was an attractive goal for the study, but the high doses of anticoagulation had proven to be potentially lethal.\n\n【4】These high rates of clotting and hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients prompted us to assemble a coagulation committee. This committee’s goal was to prevent thrombosis in COVID-19 patients while simultaneously reducing the occurrence of clinically significant hemorrhage. Thromboelastography (TEG) was an appealing test for hemostatic monitoring due to its proven benefits in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and trauma and its recent use in other studies regarding anticoagulation of hypercoagulopathic COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–13\\]</u>. This case series illustrates the use of TEG in administering anticoagulation of three COVID-19 patients and preventing hemorrhage . No written consent has been obtained from the patients as there is no patient identifiable data included in this case series.\n\n【5】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Patient demographics.</u>\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case 1: TEG-Guided Anticoagulation in a COVID-19 Patient with Falsely Elevated aPTT Caused by Hypertriglyceridemia\n\n【7】A 24-year-old Hispanic male with a 2-year history of end-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis was hospitalized with critically severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. At admission, Doppler ultrasound of all four extremities was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was administered 5,000 units of subcutaneous (SQ) UFH every eight hours for DVT prophylaxis. In addition, he received an intravenous (IV) UFH infusion because of the recent history of clotting dialysis lines. Seven days after admission, because of respiratory insufficiency and deterioration, he was endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated. Nine days after admission, he had an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 50.2 seconds; however, TEG demonstrated excessive hypocoagulability with a prolonged reaction time (R) . His heparin drip was stopped, and the overall dose was decreased to include only 5,000 units SQ UFH every twelve hours. The following morning, TEG was consistent with hypercoagulability, but the aPTT measured 122.6 seconds by optical clot detection and 81.2 seconds by mechanical clot detection (measured using the Sysmex CA-1500 with reagents Innovin and CaCl<sub>2</sub>, Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, Pennsylvania, USA) . Triglycerides were 1,456 mg/dL and D-dimer was trending upward. It was discovered that the aPTT measurement by optical clot detection is only accurate to triglyceride levels <331 mg/dL according to the manufacturer, and thus, aPTT was falsely prolonged due to the lipemia. For the rest of his stay, TEG guided anticoagulation dosing of SQ UFH ranging between 5,000 and 7,500 units every eight hours. TEG enabled an individualized regimen to prevent clotting and hemorrhage from dialysis lines despite the hemostatic dysfunction from COVID-19 superimposed with hypertriglyceridemia and renal failure.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Nine days after admission, the aPTT and TEG concurred with a supratherapeutic hypocoagulable state, and the heparin drip was stopped (dashed lines).

Case 2: TEG-Guided Anticoagulation in a COVID-19 Patient with Falsely Elevated aPTT Caused by Excessive Hemoconcentration\n\n【10】A 66-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and DVTs on chronic rivaroxaban was admitted with a moderately severe COVID-19 pneumonitis and appropriate secondary polycythemia. Doppler ultrasound of the extremities was negative for DVT at admission. Home rivaroxaban was stopped, and he was started on 9 units/kg/hr IV UFH for DVT prophylaxis. Two days after admission, he was started on furosemide 40 mg IV every twelve hours for pulmonary edema. Nine days after admission, the polycythemia was worsened to a hemoglobin of 21.4 g/dL, likely due to hemoconcentration and the COVID-19 inflammatory response. Titration of UFH was guided by aPTT every six hours and daily TEG. A sudden increase in the aPTT to 82.3 seconds occurred when the patient’s polycythemia increased beyond 21.4 g/dL. Based on the elevated aPTT, the clinical team reviewed the patient’s TEG tracing which demonstrated a lack of full anticoagulation despite an elevated aPTT . Review of the patient’s rising hemoglobin and of the effect of the hemoconcentration on the aPTT revealed that, for hemoglobin more than 21 g/dL, the presence of citrate in the sample causes false elevation, rendering the aPTT ineffective in guiding anticoagulation in this patient. Thereafter, TEG guided UFH dosing between 7 and 9 units/kg/hr to achieve a target R of 12–17 minutes because the secondary polycythemia produced an inaccurate aPTT.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Nine days after admission, TEG demonstrated subtherapeutic anticoagulation in the setting of prolonged aPTT because of hemoconcentration and polycythemia.

Case 3: TEG-Guided Anticoagulation in a COVID-19 Patient with Inherited Hypercoagulable State\n\n【13】A 49-year-old Caucasian male with a factor V Leiden mutation was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonitis. Doppler ultrasound screening of all four extremities was negative for DVT. He was started on IV UFH 8 units/kg/hr for DVT prophylaxis. One day after admission, aPTT was 32.9 seconds and within normal limits, but TEG demonstrated borderline hypercoagulability . The UFH dose was increased to 10 units/kg/hr IV. The same day, persistent heparin resistance prompted further dose escalation to 12 units/kg/hr. For the rest of his hospitalization, TEG guided goal-directed anticoagulation despite his hypercoagulable baseline , enabling us to achieve target aPTT of 40–50 seconds and R of 12–17 minutes with IV UFH 12–13 units/kg/hr. No thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications occurred prior to discharge.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 One day after admission, despite prophylactic anticoagulation dosing, a patient with factor V Leiden mutation demonstrated borderline hypercoagulability on his TEG tracing (dashed lines).

Discussion\n\n【16】COVID-19 induces distinctive changes at the endothelium causing an endotheliitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The acute inflammatory response at the endothelium is marked by the permeating phagocytic cells releasing cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and IL-8 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. This may be described as the “cytokine storm” in extreme cases. In turn, these cytokines activate factor XII, beginning the intrinsic coagulation cascade resulting in thrombin formation. Moreover, upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 expression impairs fibrinolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. These pathophysiologic immune changes procure the hypercoagulable state often found in critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, as the cytokine storm recedes, these patients may develop a sensitivity to anticoagulation, which causes them to bleed. Hence, the risk of thrombosis in these patients evolves to a risk of bleed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The immunothrombotic changes induced by COVID-19 may not be unique. The endothelial surface may undergo similar pathology as found in ECMO patients as well as those with trauma-induced coagulopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 20\\]</u>. The level of anticoagulation necessary to prevent thrombosis is likely a function of the magnitude of inflammation and the cytokine storm. As the cytokine storm wanes, intense monitoring and adjustment of the patient’s hemostatic integrity with daily TEG and aPTT enable those responsible for COVID-19 anticoagulation to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications in these critically ill patients. Based on the treatment of patients on ECMO, we elected to handle COVID-19 hypercoagulopathy with persistent monitoring by a coagulation team that followed the clinical pattern, TEG, and aPTT to guide anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. We have found this strategy to be effective in guiding goal-directed anticoagulation of our COVID-19 patients, including the three examples above.\n\n【18】Limitations of TEG include the inability to replicate the effects of endothelium on hemostasis, negligible effects of endogenous anticoagulants, and a very low shear within a closed system.

During the course of the disease, her respiratory symptoms remained mild; however, she developed acute pancreatitis leading to severe hypertension and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. During the hospitalization and treatment of acute pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, her condition improved and she was discharged in stable condition.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Herein, we report a case of acute pancreatitis, leading to severe hypertension and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 65-year-old Hispanic woman with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, end-stage renal disease, hypothyroidism, and morbid obesity was diagnosed with COVID-19 based on a routine PCR test at her hemodialysis facility. About two weeks later, she presented to our hospital with confusion, intractable nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and shortness of breath for 2 days. While the patient has been on atorvastatin, carvedilol, bumetanide, hydralazine, clonidine, detemir insulin, glipizide, glyburide, and levothyroxine, she has not been able to take her medications in the last 2 days due to severity of nausea and vomiting and missed her dialysis sessions. Her social history was negative for smoking or intake of alcoholic beverages. On arrival, her vital signs indicated blood pressure of 222/94 mmHg, pulse rate of 67/min, respiratory rate of 15/min, and temperature of 36.6°C with SpO2 of 96% on 2 L/min nasal cannula. Initial lab work indicated blood glucose of 1661 mg/dL with bicarbonate of 30.6 mmol/L, normal anion gap, and BNP of 1,810.0 pg/mL . The patient was started on insulin and nicardipine drips which improved her blood pressure and blood glucose level. Chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates with pulmonary congestion, and the patient was treated with azithromycin and ceftriaxone for COVID-19 pneumonia. Due to hyperglycemia, steroids were not started at the presentation. For treatment of severe hypertension and pulmonary edema, hemodialysis was performed. After improvement in her mental state, she reported severe epigastric abdominal with radiation to back, escalating since one day prior to hospitalization. Serum lipase was elevated (1,142 U/L; reference range: 11–82) and CT scan demonstrated diffuse edematous enlargement of the pancreas with moderate pancreatic infiltrative stranding and fluid. No gallstones, biliary dilatation, or biliary filling defects were observed. Further etiologic assessment of pancreatitis was negative for alcohol intake, hypercalcemia, severe hypertriglyceridemia, or offending medications. With continuing supportive management, patient tolerated oral intake. Five days later, she was discharged upon decrease in lipase to 261 U/L, improved blood pressure, improved glycemic control, and return to normal oxygenation.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory findings.</u>\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【8】Considering the presenting symptoms, signs, and the lab work, it seems that the patient has been experiencing acute pancreatitis, which due to intractable nausea and vomiting led to medication non-adherence and subsequently severe hypertension and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.\n\n【9】In individuals with COVID-19, elevated pancreatic enzymes were reported in about 12.1–17% of cases in different reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5, 7\\]</u>. Further, increased serum amylase and lipase to more than three times of upper normal limit has been reported in cases without diagnosis of acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Although obstructing common bile duct stones, alcohol consumption, hypertriglyceridemia, medications, traumas, and severe medical conditions comprise the majority of the underlying causes of acute pancreatitis, infectious etiologies may account for about 10% of encounters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In such cases, paramyxoviruses such as mumps and measles viruses, enteroviruses, namely, Coxsackie B viruses and hepatitis A virus, and Epstein–Barr virus from Herpesviridae are the most well-known etiologies of acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Currently, about fifty cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported in the literature in individuals with COVID-19. Nevertheless, there are several shortcomings in many of these reports which makes it difficult to assume causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and acute pancreatitis. In brief, in some of the reports, cases do not meet the diagnostic criteria of acute pancreatitis based on Atlanta classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> . In many reports, common causes of acute pancreatitis have not been clearly ruled out . Further, in some of the cases, diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and hospitalization preceded diagnosis of COVID-19 or positive SARS-CoV-2 test, which may suggest that COVID-19 has occurred as a nosocomial infection rather than serving as the etiology of the acute pancreatitis, as reported in 5 individuals with acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, in our case, 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> COVID-19 was diagnosed about two weeks prior to hospitalization and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the major etiologies of acute pancreatitis including common bile duct stone, alcohol consumption, hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, trauma, and offensive mediations were clearly ruled out.\n\n【11】Similar to other viral etiologies underlying acute pancreatitis, it is not clear if involvement of the pancreas is directly related to invasion of the virus to the pancreatic tissue and subsequent direct cytopathic effect of local SARS-CoV-2 replication or it is a consequence of immune reaction to the virus, leading to destruction of the pancreatic tissue as a naïve bystander. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Single-cell RNA analysis as well as protein expression on autopsies has shown that pancreatic ductal and acinar cells co-express these molecules, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can enter pancreatic ductal cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. Notably, messenger RNA level of ACE2 might be higher in the pancreas than in the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Also, expression of ACE2 is increased in diabetic murine models and diabetic donors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. Coronaviruses were reported to cause acute pancreatitis in ferrets and pigeons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. In cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, autopsies revealed pancreatitis without clinical suspicion of pancreatitis in 25–45.5% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 PCR was found positive in pancreas pseudocyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> suggesting that the virus may be directly present in the pancreatic tissue during the course of acute pancreatitis.

She presented with dyspnea, cough, and fatigue. Her chest CT scan revealed nodular opacities in the right upper lung. A fine needle aspirate biopsy culture yielded Phaeoacremonium and surgical pathology of the biopsy showed chronic inflammation. We successfully treated her with posaconazole and managed drug interactions between posaconazole and tacrolimus. This is the second reported case of biopsy-proven pulmonary infection by Phaeoacremonium in a kidney transplant recipient and successfully treated with posaconazole.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Phaeoacremonium species are well known plant pathogens causing stunted growth and dieback of various woody hosts especially grapevines and have been isolated from necrotic woody tissue of Prunus species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Phaeoacremonium species are dematiaceous fungi characterized by the presence of melanin or melanin-like pigments and are widely distributed in the environment particularly in soil, wood, and decomposing plant debris. Phaeohyphomycosis is a collective term for cutaneous, subcutaneous, and systemic disease caused by dematiaceous fungi. Pulmonary phaeohyphomycosis is a rare opportunistic infection of immunocompromised hosts. A review of 34 cases of dematiaceous fungal infections in organ transplant recipients revealed an overall mortality of 57% among patients with systemic disease and 7% among those with skin, soft-tissue, or joint infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】This is only the second case of biopsy-proven pulmonary infection by Phaeoacremonium in a kidney transplant recipient and the first report of successful treatment with posaconazole. Moreover, management of drug interactions between posaconazole and tacrolimus was successfully done, thereby preventing supratherapeutic levels of tacrolimus and avoiding kidney injury.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 49-year-old Caucasian female who underwent a living related kidney transplant 6 years before presented with progressive dyspnea, cough, and fatigue over 6 months that failed to improve after the administration of several antibiotic courses. She had been on tacrolimus and prednisone for maintenance immunosuppression. She lived in a rural area, had exposure to chicken sheds and barns, and was a gardener. A chest CT scan revealed nodular opacities in the right upper lobe , and she underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial fine needle aspiration biopsy of the right upper lobe nodules.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Chest CT scan before starting posaconazole showing reticulonodular opacities in the right upper lobe. (b) CT scan one month after starting posaconazole showing resolution of most of the opacities. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】Phaeoacremonium species grew from the biopsy culture within four days of incubation. Identification was assigned based on macroscopic and microscopic morphology. Initially, the surface of the mold was olive in color, becoming greyish-black upon subculture. The texture was velvety, and the reverse was black. Microscopically, pigmented hyphae with tapering, funnel-shaped phialides were observed, and conidia were hyaline and oblong, forming clusters at the tip of the phialides. Macroscopic and microscopic morphology was consistent with Phaeoacremonium species. Surgical pathology of the biopsy showed chronic inflammation but no fungal hyphae. Culture for acid fast bacilli from the biopsy specimen was negative for mycobacteria. Culture of bronchial fluid yielded Dactylaria constricta and few Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex.\n\n【9】Given that her biopsy culture yielded Phaeoacremonium and showed chronic inflammation, we started oral posaconazole 200 mg QID and reduced her tacrolimus dose from 2 mg BID to 1 mg Q day. A repeat chest CT scan one month after the institution of antifungal therapy showed improvement , and she reported reduced cough and shortness of breath. Two months after commencing treatment, we changed her posaconazole dose to 400 mg BID for greater ease of administration. She received posaconazole for 4 months and her symptoms resolved .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Graph showing serum creatinine and blood tacrolimus levels before, during, and after posaconazole treatment with tacrolimus dose adjustments. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】To et al. reported the first case of biopsy-proven Phaeoacremonium parasiticum lung infection in a kidney transplant recipient. In contrast to our case, the patient was severely immunocompromised due to chemotherapy for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. He showed initial improvement with voriconazole and caspofungin but succumbed after a prolonged period of neutropenic fever. Shah et al. described a case of probable Phaeoacremonium lung infection in a lung transplant recipient. The patient developed cavitary lung nodules in the native lung a few months after single lung transplantation. Biopsy of one of the nodules showed chronic inflammation with possible granulomatous lesions. Phaeoacremonium parasiticum grew only from the bronchoalveolar lavage culture but not from the biopsy culture. The patient improved after the administration of voriconazole and caspofungin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 26\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Phaeoacremonium species are typically isolated from thorns, wood, and soil. Human infection can be caused by traumatic implantation or occurs in the setting of immunocompromising conditions. Twenty-seven cases of human infections with Phaeoacremonium species have been reported in the literature. In immunocompetent hosts, Phaeoacremonium has been reported to cause subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis, osteomyelitis, endophthalmitis, and onychomycosis. Successful outcomes have been achieved with debridement and antifungals . In immunocompromised patients, Phaeoacremonium causes more severe disease and has been reported to cause endocarditis, brain abscesses, cavitary lung nodules, and disseminated infections. Disseminated infections in severely immunocompromised hosts are associated with poor outcomes and death .\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Skin and subcutaneous infection, osteomyelitis, endophthalmitis, and onychomycosis due to Phaeoacremonium species.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Invasive and disseminated infections due to Phaeoacremonium species.</u>\n\n【16】The other dematiaceous fungus isolated from this patient was Dactylaria constricta. It grew only from culture of bronchial fluid and not from the biopsy. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) also grew only from the culture of bronchial fluid. Given our patient’s exposure history (gardening, exposure to sheds and barns) and no growth of these organisms from the biopsy specimen, it is likely that these organisms were merely colonizers of her respiratory tract and not pathogens. Moreover, resolution of her illness without treatment for MAC suggests that it was not a pathogen.\n\n【17】There is no standard antifungal regimen described for Phaeoacremonium in the literature. Posaconazole is the most recently approved triazole with an extended spectrum of activity against a wide variety of fungi. Posaconazole was chosen over other azoles because it is well tolerated and has a favorable side effect profile and a low potential of drug interactions compared to other azoles. Posaconazole inhibits the metabolism of calcineurin inhibitors. Failure to adjust tacrolimus dosing can result in supratherapeutic levels of tacrolimus and harm the kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Our patient responded well to the treatment with no relapse of infection during 4 years of follow-up.

Case Description\n\n【6】A 51-year-old female, from Guaíba, South of Brazil, was referred to a gastroenterology outpatient clinic at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. She had noticed a decrease in her bowel habits (evacuations every three days), as well as sharp and long stools, with progressive worsening during one year period. She also had intermittent episodes of elimination of red blood mixed with feces, every 3–4 weeks; she denied associated abdominal pain, weight loss, or night sweats. On physical examination, blood pressure was 124 × 78 mmHg, heart rate 80bpm, and respiratory rate 14 and normal pulmonary and cardiac auscultations were performed. The abdomen was painless, without palpable masses or visceromegaly, and normal bowel sounds were present. The rectal examination showed no nodules, bleeding, or masses, and there was no palpable enlargement of the lymph nodes.\n\n【7】Personal and family history: symptomatic cholelithiasis (awaiting surgery), two previous cesarean sections (G2P2), and hysterectomy in 2011 (fibroids). She denied continued use of medications, alcoholism, smoking, or drug use. She had no family history of gastrointestinal tract disease or any type of cancer.\n\n【8】Investigations were performed initially with laboratory tests (blood count, renal function, electrolytes, liver function tests were normal). Afterwards, she underwent tomography of the abdomen (CT), showing two areas of irregular parietal thickening, one in the upper rectum with approximately 3.0 cm extension and the other in the middle segment of the sigmoid colon, measuring about 2.5 cm in length, presenting impregnation with contrast . These lesions were stenosing but did not determine significant upstream intestinal obstruction. Among the diagnostic possibilities, a synchronic colorectal neoplasia was highlighted. An opaque enema was performed before performing a colonoscopy that confirmed the findings of the CT scan. During rectosigmoidoscopy, the device was inserted up to 30 cm from the anal margin, where a concentric stenosis was observed, covered by macroscopically normal mucosa, preventing the progression of the device. At 15 cm from the anal margin, a caliber reduction area covered by irregular and friable mucosa was observed. A biopsy specimen was performed and the anatomopathological study resulted in colonic mucosa without relevant alterations.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Abdomen tomography with stenosing lesions in the upper rectum and sigmoid presenting impregnation with contrast, as shown by the pointing arrow.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Coronal image of abdomen tomography with stenosing lesions in sigmoid presenting impregnation with contrast, as shown by the pointing arrow.</u>\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Sagital image of abdomen tomography with stenosing lesions in the upper rectum presenting impregnation with contrast, as shown by the pointing arrow.</u>\n\n【12】The surgical team evaluated the patient and decided to perform a rectosigmoidectomy with cholecystectomy, which had no complications and evidenced the two stenoses mentioned in the tomography with surrounding fibrotic adhesions. The anatomopathological study of the surgical specimen evidenced intestinal wall endometriosis, compromising submucosa and internal and external muscular layers, with fibrosis. The patient subsequently evolved with complete improvement of the referred symptoms.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Low intestinal bleeding, represented in the case reported as hematochezia, is a sign of different pathologies, from benign to malignant. What is noticeable in this case are the intestinal cycling changes that the patient presented, rectal bleeding every 3–4 weeks, which should alert to the diagnosis of endometriosis. Inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, neoplastic diseases, diverticular disease, and hemorrhoidal disease are part of the differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Some patients have multiple lesions of endometriosis involving more than one intestinal segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, two areas of irregular parietal thickening were found, one in the upper rectum and the other in the middle segment of the sigmoid colon, which were initially interpreted as suspect of synchronic neoplasia but which, in fact, were found to be compatible with endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【16】It is known that the extension of the disease is not necessarily related to the intensity of the symptoms; many women are asymptomatic with extensive disease by incidental finding, as some women with mild illness have disabling symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

Cardiac amyloidosis is considered an infiltrative cardiomyopathy associated with an unfavorable prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The two major types of cardiac amyloidosis include acquired monoclonal immunoglobin light chain (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR).

Interventricular septum was 1.5 cm (normal: 0.7–1.1 cm), and posterior wall thickness was 1.4 cm (normal: 0.7–1.1 cm). The wall motion was normal with no suggestion for prior focal myocardial infarction. She also had a serum calcium >11 mg/dL (normal <8.6 mg/dL), with an elevated globulin gap (4.3 g/dL on admission), and serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgG lambda monoclonal peak (2683 mg/dL) (normal: <1600 mg/mL) with an abnormal kappa/lambda light chain ratio with kappa of 5.37 mg/dL (normal: <1.96 mg/dL) and lambda of 6535 mg/dL (normal: <1.96 mg/dL) concerning for plasma cell dyscrasia.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Electrocardiogram on admission showing sinus rhythm with low voltage, prior infarct of anteroseptal regions, and T-wave inversions in lateral leads.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Echocardiography shows low global longitudinal cardiac strain (−13.4%) with “cherry on top” pattern (normal value for global longitudinal strain is −20% and below in healthy individuals). Strain pattern is suggestive of possible cardiac amyloidosis.</u>\n\n【9】She later received a bone marrow biopsy which revealed 60% cellular marrow with 40% plasma cells consistent with plasma cell myeloma, but further staining was not performed. A skeletal survey also revealed lytic lesions in bilateral humeri and femurs. She was treated with diuretics on her initial admission, and the patient sought early discharge from the hospital. She was discharged with a diuretic for management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction with recommendations for a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and close follow-up with cardiology and oncology.\n\n【10】One week after discharge, she was readmitted with progressive shortness of breath, fevers, syncope, as well as a clinical presentation consistent with early cholecystitis. Laboratory studies revealed WBC >21 × 10<sup>9</sup>/dL (normal: <9.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>/dL), acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL (normal: <1.1 × mg/dL), shock liver with aspartate aminotransferase 495 U/L (normal: <40 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase 494 U/L (normal: <40 U/L), BNP of 4687 pg/mL (normal: <100 pg/mL), troponin of 2.82 ng/mL (normal: <0.04 ng/mL), and potassium of 4.6 mEq/L (normal: 3.5–5.2 mEq/L). Abdominal computed tomography scan revealed new abdominal ascites and small gallbladder stones with pericholecystic stranding and duodenal thickening. On the day after admission, she developed unstable ventricular tachycardia but spontaneously converted after two minutes to junctional bradycardia . Telemetry strips were not saved from the event. Given concern for marked sinus bradycardia and corrected QT interval of 509 ms (normal <440 ms), R-on-T phenomena was suspected as a possible cause for the patient’s polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Intravenous isoproterenol was started, and advanced cardiac life support protocol was initiated. After 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), patient awoke but was unable to maintain saturation, and she was promptly intubated. Subsequent defibrillation converted the ventricular tachycardia to a sinus rhythm with a rate of 50–60 beats per minute. There was a concern for recurrent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Immediate left heart catherization revealed nonobstructive coronary artery disease. Right heart catherization showed an elevated mean right atrial pressure of 30 mmHg, right ventricular pressure of 62/17 mmHg, mean pulmonary artery pressure of 51 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 40 mmHg, cardiac index of 1.8 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, cardiac output of 3.2 L/min, and systemic vascular resistance of 920 dynes/seconds/cm<sup>5</sup>. A transvenous pacer wire was placed to assist against further ventricular tachycardia episodes. She appeared to have a mixed picture of distributive and cardiogenic shock. She remained hypotensive and in shock despite maximized dosing for norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. The patient decompensated again with unstable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Rhythm control agents with the use of amiodarone and overdrive pacing were futile. The ventricular tachycardia persisted despite several rounds of CPR, defibrillation, epinephrine, amiodarone, and bicarbonate. The patient’s family came to the bedside and requested resuscitation efforts be terminated. They authorized the autopsy which subsequently revealed gross cardiomegaly and left ventricular hypertrophy . Congo red staining of both ventricular and hepatic tissue revealed amyloid fibrils with apple-green birefringence . Outside pathology report later confirmed AL amyloid deposition by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Electrocardiogram after cardiac arrest with junctional bradycardia and premature ventricular complexes.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Autopsy of cardiac muscle with increased subpericardial fat asymmetrically concentrated more towards the right ventricle compared to the left ventricle.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 (a) Infiltrative amyloid deposits noted among the myocytes on hematoxylin and eosin stain.

Discussion\n\n【15】The patient had an unusual presentation of symptoms with rapid progression of heart failure and tachyarrhythmia. Her two hospitalizations were one week apart. While she was scheduled for outpatient workup for her plasma cell dyscrasia, this was unable to be completed due to her rapid progression and subsequent readmission. She developed cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias that were nonresponsive to conventional therapies. Early recognition and diagnosis and treatment are vital for patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【16】Among the different types of amyloidosis, primary AL and both secondary amyloidosis ATTRm and ATTRwt can commonly involve the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. Manifestations of cardiac amyloidosis include heart failure and heart block 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Infiltration of amyloid fibrils in the ventricles results in stiffening progressing to restrictive cardiomyopathy causing diastolic dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 7, 8\\]</u>. Cytotoxic effects of amyloid fibrils lead to apoptosis and fibrosis with eventual systolic dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 9\\]</u>. The classic symptoms of heart failure manifest with exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia with 10–20% incidence in all cases of cardiac amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Other common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> conduction abnormalities include ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Physical examination findings include those of heart failure including JVD, lower extremity edema, and an S3 gallop 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Extracardiac manifestations include purpura, macroglossia, periorbital edema, nephrotic syndrome, hepatomegaly, ascites, and bilateral carpal syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【17】There are various cardiac diagnostic modalities that facilitate the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. A brief review of literature is presented as follows.\n\n【18】Electrocardiogram: cardiac amyloidosis manifests as pseudoinfarction pattern with low voltage in limb leads (<5 mm) and poor R-wave progression and precordial leads 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In AL, 50% have low voltage in frontal and precordial leads, whereas in ATTR, only 30% meet low voltage criteria (low voltage may be confined to frontal leads only) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Cyrille et al. explains that the sum of amplitudes of S wave in V1 and R wave in V5 or V6 more than 3.5 mV is considered a measure of left ventricular hypertrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and less than 1.5 mV is associated with dismal outcomes in all cardiac amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 15\\]</u>. Absence of left ventricular hypertrophy does not exclude cardiac amyloidosis as only 10–20% will meet left ventricular hypertrophy criteria, while up to 50% will have pseudoinfarction pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14–16\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Echocardiogram: echocardiographic findings include biatrial enlargement, ventricular wall and valvular thickening, diastolic dysfunction, and classic granular sparkling appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Doppler measurements include the assessment of ratio (E/A) of early (E) and late (A) diastolic peak velocities along with deceleration time (time taken by peak E velocity to return to baseline) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Assessment of strain and strain rate (longitudinal axis dysfunction) can help diagnose cardiac amyloidosis earlier in subclinical stages and gauge survival outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The development of speckle-tracking echocardiography better analyzes the longitudinal axis, particularly radial and circumferential strain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The significant decrease of longitudinal strain in the mid and basal wall regions with preservation of the apical region has high sensitivity and specificity (ranging from 90%–95% and 80%–85%, respectively) for cardiac amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Diffuse valve thickening, atrial septal thickening, and right ventricular hypertrophy help differentiate cardiac amyloidosis from other causes of left ventricular hypertrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. ATTR is common in aortic stenosis and can be seen in up to 15% of elderly patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The “cherry on top” strain pattern was found in our patient on the prior admission , but further workup was warranted for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【20】Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: cardiac magnetic resonance imaging employs various techniques including strain analysis and tissue imaging with and without contrast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can assess strain with a technique known as displacement encoding with stimulated echoes with high sensitivity and specificity rivaling echocardiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Myocardial injury secondary to amyloid deposition in the interstitium serves as a reservoir for gadolinium accumulation resulting in characteristic late gadolinium enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. This technique has a sensitivity of close to 80% and specificity of 94% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Late gadolinium enhancement when coupled with phase-sensitive inversion recovery has shown to provide a better assessment of the extent of cardiac involvement allowing Fontana 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> to classify patients with AL and ATTR in 3 subcategories (normal, subendocardium, and transmural) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Transmural is associated with the worst prognosis (5.4-fold increase in mortality) and the progression of normal to subendocardium to transmural late gadolinium was proportionally related to extracellular volume expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Although cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has extreme diagnostic utility, our patient decompensated acutely prior to obtaining this study.\n\n【21】Nuclear imaging: a noninvasive way to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis involves the accumulation of radiotracers, most commonly technetium-99m and 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-DPD) and technetium-99m-pyrophosphate (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-PYP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 25\\]</u>. <sup>99m</sup>Tc-DPD scintigraphy has been useful in the workup for cardiac amyloidosis with high specificity and sensitivity for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis while showing low seismicity and high specificity for AL cardiac amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. In addition to <sup>99m</sup>Tc-DPD and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-PYP, technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-MDP) scintigraphy has also been studied in cardiac amyloidosis workup. All three forms of nuclear testing have shown such high sensitivity and specificity, especially when resulting with high uptake (Grade 2 or Grade 3) that additional endomyocardial biopsy would not be necessary for the diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Despite these imaging modalities, endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard given the ability to use microscopy and histopathology and directly observes the deposition of amyloid fibrils as amorphous deposits 通用删除1(英):<u>(as seen in our patient, Figure 5)</u>. Endomyocardial biopsy is a relatively safe procedure with almost 100% sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. However, our latent pathological diagnosis was from tissue obtained by autopsy.\n\n【22】The treatment modalities of cardiac amyloidosis are mainly aimed at managing clinical heart failure but specifically managing amyloidosis may involve chemotherapy and various transplant modalities including hematopoietic stem cell, heart, and liver transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8, 29\\]</u>. The role of heart transplant is still under investigation. Younger patients <60 years without associated plasma cell dyscrasia or other major organ involvement are better candidates for orthotopic heart transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】Cardiac amyloidosis is a life-threatening manifestation of systemic amyloidosis. Patients with exertional dyspnea, low voltage electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram with left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction are concerning for cardiac amyloidosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and phase-sensitive inversion recovery was initially ordered as the next step in our workup of cardiac amyloidosis. While supportive therapy for heart failure, chemotherapy and transplant are the currently available modalities for treatment, and the prognosis of cardiac amyloidosis depends upon the extent of myocardial involvement with amyloid. In addition, previously undiagnosed, advance-stage multiple myeloma was likely the precursor of our patient’s cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【25】Unfortunately, our patient progressed rapidly from heart failure to ventricular storm, thus underlining the importance of expediting advanced imaging diagnostics that may have facilitated expedient management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:17", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:39", "cost": 21.757}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:15"}

The PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. The medical procedure consisted of orotracheal intubation to guarantee the safety of the airway, in addition to close surveillance in the intensive care unit and constant monitoring of vital signs.

Introduction\n\n【3】Tracheobronchial injuries occurring after penetrating or blunt trauma are rare, although unfortunately they can be life-threatening. It has been indicated that a high percentage of these patients die before being admitted to the hospital, and a significant number die within the first hours after admission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Penetrating injury to the airways can occur from sharp objects, or from wounds firearm injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, while iatrogenic airway injury can occur during surgery, endotracheal intubation, or bronchoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, the incidence of airway injury is likely to be underestimated since these injuries are often poorly recognized and reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

This article reports the case of a patient with tracheal perforation due to closed neck trauma, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2, who had conservative medical management through orotracheal intubation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The case of a 42-year-old female patient with no medical history is described. She was admitted to a high-complexity hospital after suffering a traffic accident. The patient presented amnesia of the event and an altered state of consciousness. She also presented facial trauma, closed trauma to the neck and left arm, and lacerations to the lower extremities.\n\n【6】Upon her admission, the following vital signs were observed: blood pressure 130/64 mmHg, heart rate 90 per minute, respiratory rate 17 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The physical examination revealed an alert patient, oriented in the three spheres, with left periorbital ecchymosis, wound in the upper eyelid on its medial side, with little active bleeding and limited eye-opening. She was immobilized with a rigid collar, with a nonpulsatile hematoma in the neck area, with pain on palpation in the left lateral face, and with subcutaneous emphysema in zone II of the neck. Moreover, she had no stigmata of the chest  or abdominal trauma.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest X-ray: emphysema is observed in the cervical region, the cardiothoracic index was within normal limits, and no rib fractures, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion are identified, without consolidations or interstitial infiltrate.</u>\n\n【8】High-risk mild cranial brain trauma was suspected with a left orbital fracture, without compromise of visual acuity, with closed cervical trauma, with soft signs of the airway and/or vascular injury. Initially, continuous monitoring was requested, intravenous fluids (500 cc bolus), angiotomography of neck vessels, and tomography of the paranasal sinuses and face, in addition to contrast-enhanced tomography of the chest and abdomen. Administration of tetanus toxoid, analgesics, and paraclinical were also ordered. Furthermore, the patient incidentally reported 5 days of dry cough, no runny nose, no fever, no signs of respiratory distress, and no diarrhea. However, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an antigen test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were requested to detect the virus. The patient was isolated in the acute respiratory care unit.\n\n【9】The computerized axial tomography (CT) of the neck, thorax, and abdomen showed anterior and proximal tracheal injury and dissolution of continuity of 2 mm of the anterior infraglottic airway in the proximal third , with emphysema subcutaneous dissecting the visceral, carotid, and prevertebral space and causing anterior and middle pneumomediastinum, with a decrease in the diameter of the airway at the level of the glottis . The tomography of the paranasal sinuses showed fractures of the nasal bones, local and left periorbital edema. Simple skull CT showed no pathological findings. No lesions were found in large vessels of the neck . It was decided to intubate the patient on an emergency basis in the hands of anesthesiology with all protective measures in the context of a patient suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 A 2 mm continuity solution of the anterior infraglottic airway is observed.</u>\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Subcutaneous emphysema is observed dissecting the visceral, carotid, and prevertebral space and causing anterior and middle pneumomediastinum, with a decrease in the diameter of the airway at the level of the glottis.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 No lesions are evident in large vessels of the neck.</u>\n\n【13】The patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit due to anterior and proximal tracheal injury of the anterior infraglottic airway in medical management with orotracheal intubation. In addition, the result of the PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, an issue that could complicate the outcome of the case. The medical conduct consisted of orotracheal intubation to guarantee the safety of the airway, in addition to close surveillance in the intensive care unit and constant monitoring of vital signs. During clinical surveillance, there was no evidence of an increase in subcutaneous emphysema, nor the presence of signs of respiratory distress.\n\n【14】In these cases, bronchoscopy should also be performed to confirm the diagnosis and see the injury site. However, considering that the patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2, the bronchoscopy was not performed because the risk of contagion could be increased during the procedure. Moreover, at that time, the patient already showed signs of improvement.\n\n【15】The patient was discharged on the eighth day after her admission with anterior and proximal tracheal injury and nasal fractures; she was given follow-up and outpatient rehabilitation.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】In the present case, the conservative medical management of a tracheal perforation after blunt trauma in a patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 is described. Although the tracheobronchial injury is more common among women, men tend to have a higher risk of mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Moreover, the most frequent cause of tracheobronchial injuries due to blunt trauma is motor vehicle accidents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【18】As observed in the present case, the typical findings in the context of tracheobronchial injury include subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In the diagnosis of tracheal injury, the degree of clinical suspicion, CT, and bronchoscopy are helpful. Radiographic images may reveal pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, or the tracheal tear itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The treatment of tracheobronchial injury in most cases must be individualized, depending on the patient’s comorbidities, the clinical presentation, and the anatomy of the tracheobronchial injury. As in the present case, it has been described that in tracheobronchial lesions involving the mucosal layer with mediastinal or subcutaneous emphysema (level II lesions), patients are treated according to their manifestations with nonsurgical therapy. However, it has been reported that if managed conservatively, tracheal perforations are associated with a 10-fold increase in mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, although in the absence of progressive deterioration, open lesions, or mediastinitis, conservative treatment has not been associated with increased mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【20】As described in this report, it is recommended to periodically assess clinical parameters, including stability of respiration and subcutaneous emphysema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The prognosis for the patient with tracheobronchial injury depends on several factors related to the underlying clinical status of the patient, the degree of the tracheobronchial injury, and the type of repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>; consequently, the prognosis of the patient in the present case was good. However, it is necessary to highlight that when a tracheal perforation occurs, in addition to an infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there could be a greater risk of causing a ventilatory failure that could cause complications such as severe pneumonia due to COVID, a longer stay in intensive care unit and even death.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:16:23", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:17:46", "cost": 83.514}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:17:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:16:22"}

Wilson’s disease is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Clinical signs, biochemical parameters, histologic findings, and/or ATP7B genetic testing are required to diagnose Wilson’s disease. Case Presentation. 25-year-old and 22-year-old young women (siblings) presented to the University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, with difficulty of keeping balance of 3-year duration and progressive extremity weakness of 5-year duration, respectively. Both siblings had visible ocular Kayser–Fleischer rings, low serum ceruloplasmin level and increased urinary copper content, ultrasound-evidenced cirrhotic liver disease, and axial T<sub>2</sub>\\-weighted MRI hyperintensities in basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem (midbrain and pons). Diagnosis of Wilson’s disease was established in both patients using a diagnostic scoring system proposed by “8<sup>th</sup> International Meeting on Wilson Disease and Menkes Disease, Leipzig 通用删除7(英):<u>(2001)</u>.” Treatment with D-penicillamine as a chelator and zinc sulphate as a metalothionein-inductor was started. Screening of their family members was recommended. Conclusion. Wilson’s disease, declared to be an orphan disease, requires clinical acumen of physicians and expensive investigation modalities for prompt recognition and is inaccessible as required, lifelong drugs for treatment.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Wilson’s disease (WD) was first described by Kinnear Wilson in 1912, as “hepatolenticular degeneration” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder, caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, leading to impaired hepatocellular copper transport, and subsequently results in deleterious accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea. The prevalence of WD is estimated to be 1 in 30,000 individuals in nonconsanguineous families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The clinical features may vary from asymptomatic state with biochemical abnormalities, hepatic diseases, neurologic deficits, and psychiatric disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–11\\]</u>. Diagnosis is established by a clinical scoring system proposed by “8<sup>th</sup> International Meeting on Wilson Disease and Menkes Disease, Leipzig 通用删除7(英):<u>(2001)</u>” as presenting clinical and laboratory parameters lack diagnostic accuracy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Symptoms of Wilson’s disease can be effectively controlled by medical therapy (chelation therapy, zinc salts, and dietary advice), while liver transplantation is held in reserve for those with severe liver disease and incapacitating neurologic deficit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5, 11–14\\]</u>. Here, we discourse two cases of Wilson’s disease presented with neurologic deficits.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case-1\n\n【7】A 25-year-old young woman presented to the University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, with progressive difficulty of keeping balance of three-year duration and change in voice (slurring of speech) and tremor of hands of six-month duration. She had no visual disturbance, weakness of extremities, or bladder or bowel problem. She had no memory loss or epileptic fits. Her younger sister has been wheel-chaired due to neurologic problem. No preceding head injury or excess alcohol intake. Serology for HIV infection was negative. There was no history of yellowish discoloration of eyes, urine color change, or abdominal distension.\n\n【8】On physical examination, she was nourished, conscious, and oriented. Vital signs were within normal limits and stable. She had pink conjunctivae and nonicteric sclerae. Her lungs, heart, and abdomen examinations were unremarkable. On neurologic examination, she was oriented in time, place, and person. There were no cranial nerve abnormalities. No motor or sensory deficits occurred. Tandem walk and heel-to shin tests were poorly performed. She had dysarthria (slurred speech) and intention tremor of hands. Then, diagnosis of ataxic disorder due to multiple sclerosis was made at initial evaluation. Diagnosis of Wilson’s disease was considered by the neurologist by pointing out the Kayser–Fleischer ring on both eyes, after the radiologist reported the possibility of Wilson’s disease on MRI imaging.\n\n【9】A laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin 15 gm/dl (normal, 12–18 gm/dl), total leukocyte count 5,200/μl (normal, 4000–11,000/μl; granulocyte 54%, lymphocyte 35%), platelet count 87,000/μl (normal, 150,000–450,000/μl), and ESR 01 mm in first hour. Serum biochemical tests were normal. Serum tests for ANA and RF were negative. The serologic test for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C infections was negative. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed the coarse echotexture liver with surface irregularity. Axial T<sub>2</sub>\\-weighted MRI images showed bilateral hyperintensities on basal ganglia and thalamus . Serum ceruloplasmin level by immunoturbidimetry and 24 hr urinary copper content by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were determined in the International Diagnostic Laboratory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to support the imaging diagnosis. Serum ceruloplasmin concentration was reduced (<10 mg/dl), and 24 hr urinary copper excretion was increased (142.2 μg/24 hrs).

Case-2\n\n【15】A 22-year-old, wheel-chaired, young woman presented to the University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, with progressive weakness of proximal muscles (difficulty to go upstairs and stand from toilet, followed by difficulty of combing hair, and at last unable to stand) of 5-year duration and unable to keep balance of 3-year duration. She has been wheel-chaired in the last six months due to neurologic problem. She had been transiently incontinent to urine. She was treated with high-dose prednisolone (60 mg, po, daily) for six months with presumptive diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy but had no improvement. She had no memory loss or epileptic fits. Serology for HIV infection was negative. There was no history of yellowish discoloration of eyes, urine color change, or abdominal distension.\n\n【16】On physical examination, she was undernourished, conscious, and oriented. Vital signs were with in normal limits and stable. She had pallor of conjunctivae and nonicteric sclerae. Kayser–Fleischer rings were visible with naked eye. Her lungs, heart, and abdomen examinations were unremarkable. On neurologic examination, she was oriented in time, place, and person. No cranial nerve abnormalities occurred. She had proximal muscle weakness and atrophy on both upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were variable. Tandem walk was difficult to perform due to weakness. She had head titubation and intention tremor of hands. Finger-to-nose was poorly performed. Diagnosis of ataxic disorder and myopathy due to Wilson’s disease was considered after confirmed diagnosis of prior case. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, biochemical tests, copper studies, and brain MRI were requested.\n\n【17】A laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin 8.6 gm/dl (normal, 12–18 gm/dl), total leukocyte count 3,700/μl (normal, 4000–11,000/μl; granulocyte 57%, lymphocyte 30%), and platelet count 137,000/μl (normal, 150,000–450,000/μl). Serum biochemical tests were normal. Serum tests for ANA and RF were negative. The serologic test for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C infections was negative. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed the coarse echotexture liver with surface irregularity. Axial T<sub>2</sub>\\-weighted MRI images showed bilateral hyperintensities on basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem. “Face of the giant panda” in the midbrain was spotted on the MRI image . Serum ceruloplasmin level was reduced (10.5 mg/dl), and 24 hr urinary copper content was increased (110.5 μg/24 hrs). In sum, the clinical signs, biochemical tests, and imaging findings met diagnostic criteria for Wilson’s disease (K-F rings present, score 2; severe neurologic symptoms, score 2; serum ceruloplasmin level = 10.5 mg/dl, score 1; urinary copper content >2 × ULN, score 2; diagnosis of Wilson’s disease established with score ≥4) . The global assessment score (GAS) was L3C0M4O4 at time of diagnosis. Then after, she was started on D-penicillamine, 300 mg, po, daily, and dose escalated by 300 mg monthly, to reach a target dose of 900 mg, po, daily. She was as well started on zinc sulphate, 110 mg, po, twice daily, and pyridoxine 25 mg, po, daily, and advised to avoid copper-rich diet.

Discussion\n\n【20】Wilson’s disease (WD) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired hepatocellular copper metabolism. Mutation of ATP7B gene at chromosome 13 encodes defective hepatic copper transporting P-type ATPase at trans-Golgi network and cytoplasmic vesicles, which hinders ceruloplasmin synthesis and biliary excretion of copper. Hence, excess serum nonceruloplasmin bound copper results in tissue toxicity via oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis in hepatic and extrahepatic organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Clinical characteristics of reported Wilson’s disease in Sub-Saharan Africa in the last three decades are shown in Table 3. Patients with WD initially present with a variable degree of hepatic (40–50%), neurologic (50–60%), and ophthalmic (50–90%) manifestations. Mean age of onset for hepatic disease is 10–15 years and unusual beyond 40 years. The clinical spectrum of hepatic disease may assume several forms. The asymptomatic state with persistently elevated serum transaminase activity has been witnessed. Presence of Coomb’s negative hemolytic anemia, hepatic dysfunction with jaundice, ascites, coagulopathy, elevated serum transaminase activity, and hyperbilirubinemia heralds acute hepatitis. Progressive cirrhosis is a frequent mode of hepatic presentation of WD. Mean age of onset for neurologic disease is often a decade later than hepatic disease. Most patients with neurological symptoms have some degree of liver disease. The spectrum of neurological syndromes comprises Parkinsonian-type (bradykinesia, rigidity, and cognitive deficit), pseudosclerotic-type (tremor, ataxia, and dysarthria), and arrhythmic-hyperkinesia-type (chorea, athetosis, and dystonia). Tremor and dysarthria are the most common initial neurologic symptoms. Dystonia and gait disorders are often reported. A variety of psychiatric problems were documented in WD. Inappropriate behaviors include labile mood, irritability, impulsiveness, and disinhibition. Antisocial or criminal behaviors have been reported. Severe depression with suicidal attempts and frank psychosis were observed as major psychiatric disorder. Cognitive changes manifest with reduced scholastic performance, executive abilities, and visuospatial processing. Kayser–Fleischer rings and sunflower cataracts are ocular hallmarks of WD. Few of the extra hepatolenticular features consist of neuropathy, myopathy, renal tubulopathy, premature osteoporosis, and arthritis. Biochemical findings in WD consist of low serum ceruloplasmin level and increased urinary copper content. Axial T<sub>2</sub>\\-weighted and FLAIR-MRI images suggest bilateral hyperintensities on basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. “Face of the giant panda” in the midbrain is classic MRI sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–11\\]</u>. Diagnosis of Wilson’s disease is established by the scoring system proposed by “8<sup>th</sup> International Meeting on Wilson Disease and Menkes Disease, Leipzig 通用删除7(英):<u>(2001)</u>,” which encompasses the combination of clinical signs, biochemical parameters, histologic findings, and mutation analysis of ATP7B gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 Summary of Wilson’s disease reported in Sub-Saharan Africa in the last three decades.</u>\n\n【23】Our patients presented with pseudosclerotic-type neurologic deficit, ocular Kayser–Fleischer rings, ultrasound-evidenced cirrhotic liver disease, axial T2-weighted MRI-hyperintensities on basal ganglia and brainstem, and abnormal copper studies (low ceruloplasmin level and increased urinary copper content), which established diagnosis of Wilson’s disease. The most likely differential diagnosis for pseudosclerotic-type Wilson’s disease includes Friedreich ataxia, multiple sclerosis, and manganese storage disease. Features of progressive limb and gait ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria, and motor weakness at young age favored the autosomal recessive inherited ataxic disorder, Friedreich ataxia. Genetic testing for frataxin, containing expanded GAA triplet repeats, confirms the diagnosis. The other likely diagnosis was multiple sclerosis, as patients presented with gait ataxia, intention tremor, and slurred speech due to inflammatory, demyelinating cerebellar pathways. Presence of MRI-evidenced plaques in the brain and spinal cord, which disseminate in time and space, supports the diagnosis. Manganese storage disease, autosomal recessive disease, is named as “new Wilson disease” as it often presents with pseudosclerotic- or Parkinsonian-type neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Bilateral hyperintensities in basal ganglia is spotted in T1-weighted MRI imaging. Genetic testing for SLC30A10 gene mutation settles the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Medical therapy such as chelators (penicillamine and trientine) and zinc salts effectively controls symptoms of WD via decoppering effect and enterocytic metalothionein-inductance, respectively. Liver transplantation is indicated in those with fulminant hepatic failure (Revised King’s Score ≥11), progressive hepatic dysfunction due to advanced hepatic cirrhosis, and severe progressive neurologic deficit unresponsive to chelation therapy. Majority of patients with WD succumb from complications of progressive liver disease. Screening of family members of the index case should be routinely practiced to identify and treat early symptomatic and asymptomatic cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5, 10–14\\]</u>.\n\n【25】In conclusion, Wilson’s disease, declared to be an orphan disease, requires clinical acumen of physicians and expensive investigation modalities for prompt recognition and is inaccessible as required, lifelong drugs for treatment.\n\n【26】#### Abbreviations\n\n| ATPase: | Adenosine 5′ triphosphatase |\n| --- | --- |\n| ATP: | Adenosine triphosphate |\n| ALT: | Alanine aminotransferase |\n| AST: | Aspartate aminotransferase |\n| ANA: | Antinuclear antibody |\n| BUN: | Blood urea nitrogen |\n| ESR: | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate |\n| FLAIR: | Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery |\n| HIV: | Human immunodeficiency virus |\n| HBsAg: | Hepatitis B surface antigen |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| RF: | Rheumatoid factor |\n| ULN: | Upper limit of normal |\n| WD: | Wilson’s disease. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:06:58", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:07:26", "cost": 27.498}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:07:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:06:58"}

They are related to mutations in the CNTNAP1 (contactin associated protein 1) gene, playing an important role in myelination. Recent studies have shown that both diseases could present with a wide phenotypic spectrum, with promising survival up to early childhood. We report on a 7-year-old boy from a nonconsanguineous Lebanese family presenting with neonatal hypotonia, respiratory distress, and arthrogryposis. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of a pathogenic variant in the CNTNAP1 gene leading to a premature stop codon: NM\\003632.2:c.3361C>T p.(Arg1121). A review of the literature is discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Mutations the CNTNAP1 gene (contactin associated protein 1) (OMIM 602346) have been associated with two rare autosomal recessive congenital diseases, lethal congenital contracture syndrome type 7 (LCCS7) (OMIM 616286), and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy type 3 (CHN3) (OMIM 618186). CNTNAP1 is located on chromosome 17q21 and encodes a contactin-associated transmembrane receptor (CASPR), highly essential in the formation of paranodal axoglial junctions in myelinated axons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】CNTNAP1 is also involved in regulating neural progenitor cells and the development of cerebral cortex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It was first implicated in human disease in 2014, leading to disorders characterized by polyhydramnios, severe neonatal hypotonia, arthrogryposis, facial diplegia, and severe motor paralysis, leading to death in early infancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. These mutations have been reported in 31 patients, with a wide phenotypic spectrum and promising survival up to early childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here, we report on a new case presenting with LCCS7 with a novel identified CNTNAP1 variant, with survival beyond early infancy.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【7】This study is conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n【8】##### 2.1. Clinical Presentation\n\n【9】The patient is a 7-year-old boy, born to Lebanese unrelated healthy parents. He is the second of three children, his siblings being both healthy.\n\n【10】##### 2.2. Whole Exome Sequencing\n\n【11】After informed consent was obtained by the parents in compliance with national ethics regulation, genomic DNA extraction was performed from peripheral blood using standard techniques.\n\n【12】Approximately 60 Mb of the consensus coding sequences (>99%) were enriched from fragmented genomic DNA using the SureSelect Human All Exon V6 kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the generated library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with an average coverage depth of 100x. An end-to-end bioinformatics pipelines including base calling, primary filtering of low quality reads and probable artefacts, and annotation of variants was applied.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【14】##### 3.1. Clinical Report\n\n【15】Pregnancy was complicated with placental abruption and unexplained polyhydramnios. The patient was born after an emergent C-section at 35 weeks of gestational age, with generalized hypotonia and a severe respiratory distress. His weight was 2340 g (25<sup>th</sup> percentile), his length was 47 cm (50<sup>th</sup> percentile), and his head circumference was 36 cm (>97<sup>th</sup> percentile). On initial examination, he was comatose, hypotonic, with absence of spontaneous motility, and intermittent trepidation of lower limbs. He was intubated and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Upon admission, initial metabolic and infectious workups were within normal ranges. Cardiac evaluation was normal. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a slowing of flow in some superficial cortical veins with asymmetric flow in both transverse sinuses with no visible thrombophlebitis. An electroencephalogram monitoring revealed a slowed cerebral activity with intermittent burst suppressions. Neurological workout included the dosage of neurotransmitters in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that identified a dosage of L-dopa at 31 nmol/L (reference range lower than 30 nmol/L), a low dosage of homovanillic acid (HVA) (<543 nmol/L; reference range between 601 and 1397 nmol/L), and a low dosage of 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) (<383 nmol/L; reference range between 382 and 949 nmol/L).\n\n【16】On clinical examination at one month of age, the patient remained hypotonic, areflexic, with no visual tracking nor blinking, and an absence of muscular movements of the intercostal muscles. He also presented a major plagiocephaly and a persistent upper limbs contraction. He was noted to have epicanthal folds, thickened nares, and thickened lips. He received valproic acid for recurrent generalized clonic movements. Dilated fundus examination revealed an anterior subcapsular cataract in the right eye. The patient underwent tracheotomy and gastrostomy. Complementary metabolic workout was within normal ranges, including amino acid and organic acid chromatography. Muscle biopsy revealed muscular hypertrophy with mitochrondrial and neurogenic dysfunction. Congenital disorders of glycosylation were ruled out, as well as Prader-Willi syndrome, by genetic studies. Finally, a tracheotomy was undergone because of the impossibility of ventilation weaning, and the patient was fed by gastrostomy, due to the absence of swallowing.\n\n【17】Afterwards, no changes occurred in his clinical status. At seven years, generalized hypotonia remained prominent, and the patient showed a failure to thrive, with a weight of 16 kg (<1<sup>st</sup> percentile), a length of 102 cm (<1<sup>st</sup> percentile), and a head circumference of 56 cm (>97<sup>th</sup> percentile). Tracheotomy weaning turned out to be impossible and nutrition was provided exclusively by gastrostomy. No infections were detected and the patient received all his immunizations.\n\n【18】##### 3.2. Molecular Analysis\n\n【19】By whole-exome sequencing (WES), we detected a homozygous variant in the CNTNAP1 gene NM\\003632.2:c.3361C>T p.(Arg1121) that creates a premature stop codon. This variant has been confirmed by Sanger sequencing and found at the heterozygous state in both parents. It was classified as likely pathogenic (class 2) according to the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【21】CNTNAP1 involvement in human diseases was first described by Laquérriere in 2014 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. To this day, most of the 31 identified patients (11 LCCS7 and 20 CHN3), issued from 20 families, were males and answered to diverse ethnicities (Palestinian, Irish, English, American, Qatari, Lebanese, and French), which brings the number of affected families to twenty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 6–11\\]</u>. Only seven girls were reported to be affected, three of which were diagnosed with LCCS7 and four with CHN3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. First degree consanguinity was noted in most families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【22】##### 4.1. Clinical Features\n\n【23】All affected patients presented with respiratory distress at birth, secondary to motor nerve paralysis. Most of them were born preterm (58%) and had marked fetal akinesia (42%) with polyhydramnios (97%). Another classical finding was the absence of swallowing (58%). However, arthrogryposis multiplex congenital was present in 42%, with a nonspecific joint involvement. Hypotonia (87%) remains frequent in this population. Other findings remain rare and nonpathognomonic .\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Review of clinical features associated with LCCS7 and CHN3.</u>\n\n【25】The above described patient answers to most of the clinical features reported previously. He also presented some of the rare features cited in the literature, such as seizures and epicanthus. To this date, this is the only surviving patient showing evidence of an isolated unilateral anterior subcapsular cataract in association with LCCS7. No known cause of juvenile nor congenital cataract was identified. The ophthalmological examination was otherwise within normal ranges, and the seizures were well controlled under treatment. Moreover, no other reported case underwent a dosage of CSF neurotransmitters, which could be a track to follow for further studies of management.\n\n【26】##### 4.2. Histopathology\n\n【27】Nerve biopsy is now less often performed, as genetic testing in patients with hereditary neuropathies is becoming increasingly used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 12\\]</u>. However, sural nerve biopsy is nonspecific and consists mainly of paranodal abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9\\]</u>, along with significant homogeneous axonal loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6, 9, 11\\]</u>, significant decrease of large myelinated fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10, 11\\]</u> and thin myelin sheaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6, 9–11\\]</u>, all consistent with hypomyelinating neuropathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 10\\]</u>. Muscle biopsy can reveal early muscle innervation disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> with generalized small muscle fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u> and neurogenic muscular atrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. On electron microscopic examination, a marked widening of the nodes of Ranvier is often noticed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 6, 11\\]</u>, leading to a loss of attachment sites of the myelin loops in the paranodal regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 11\\]</u> and an absence of the typical transverse bands that cross the paranodal junctional gap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【28】##### 4.3. Imaging\n\n【29】Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is also nonspecific and could reveal signs of hypomyelination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7–10\\]</u> and cerebral atrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8–10\\]</u>. Cases have been reported with normal brain MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 8, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【30】##### 4.4. Functional Explorations\n\n【31】Electroencephalography (EEG) might show a discontinuous immature pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, while electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies converge to a neurogenic rather than a myopathic pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9\\]</u>. Auditory and visual evoked potentials could be nonspecifically altered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【32】##### 4.5. Antenatal Diagnosis\n\n【33】Fetal sonography can detect prenatal manifestations for LCCS7, such as fetal hypokinesia, abnormal positioning of the limbs, and polyhydramnios that require therapeutic amniotic fluid reductions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. No interference with fetal growth velocity has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Detection can go as far as 27 weeks of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. No patient has been recorded to be born before 30 weeks of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【34】##### 4.6. Genetic Counseling\n\n【35】The present case identifies a new pathogenic variant in the CNTNAP1 gene, leading to a premature codon stop. The list of reported variants is presented in Table 2. While CHN3 can be caused by either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the CNTNAP1 gene, LCCS7 is only caused by a homozygous mutation.\n\n【36】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Variants in CNTNAP1 gene.</u>\n\n【37】##### 4.7. Management\n\n【38】Although there is no evidence of a milder phenotype, extensive medical care might explain the survival of twelve cases to this day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Of the latter, four underwent gastrostomy and twelve tracheostomy at the neonatal intensive care unit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8–10\\]</u>. Supportive treatment must be provided accordingly.\n\n【39】##### 4.8. Prognosis\n\n【40】Life expectancy in patients with LCCS7 is usually limited to death in the neonatal period, varying from a few hours of life to three months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11\\]</u>. However, patients with CHN3 are reaching early teenager years, with the oldest reported patient at 15 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. To this day, ten patients with CHN3 are reported to be alive, and only one girl with LCCS7 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>; we report on the second LCCS7 patient to remain alive, leading to a total of twelve cases. Respiratory distress was the main cause of death.\n\n【41】##### 4.9. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【42】CHN were first described by Dejerine and Sottas in the late 1800s, and they consisted essentially of progressive muscle wasting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Later on, a larger spectrum has been identified and new classifications emerged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 14, 15\\]</u>. CHN present with hypotonia, areflexia, and distal muscle weakness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15–19\\]</u>.

This chronic lymph leakage leads to a state of immunosuppression secondary to the loss of humoral and cellular components of the immune system and represents a potential risk factor for opportunistic infections. We report a case of protein-losing enteropathy in a seemingly immunocompetent patient. An intestinal histopathological study revealed the unusual association of lymphangiectasia and intestinal cryptococcosis. Although cryptococcal infection is common in immunocompromised patients, intestinal involvement is rarely reported. We found no reports on the association of intestinal cryptococcosis in patients with lymphangiectasia. This case report is the first to describe intestinal cryptococcosis associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case\n\n【3】A 37-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain exacerbation of 3 hours of evolution associated diarrhea with melena. The patient had a documented medical history of intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea over the 6 months prior to the current admission. Upon admission, the patient presented febrile and in anasarca, with major edema in lower limbs. Initial blood work showed moderate microcytic anemia (Hb 10.3 g/dl, Hct. 23.7%, and MCV 75 fL), severe hypoalbuminemia (1.7 g/dL), inversion of albumin/globulin ratio, and CBC did not show signs of infection.\n\n【4】The patient was started on protein replenishment with human albumin which resolved partially the edema.\n\n【5】An exhaustive workout was performed to identify the underlying cause of the edema and low protein levels. Liver disease was ruled out due to normal liver profile (total bilirubin 0.21 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 0.11 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.10 mg/dL, AST 9 IU/L, and ALT 8 IU/L) and the negative liver ultrasound. Nephrotic syndrome was also ruled out as a possible diagnosis.\n\n【6】Due to the persistence of abdominal pain, structural damage or tumor processes were investigated; however, abdominal CT only showed edema in the small intestine wall suggesting chronic enteropathy.\n\n【7】Although the patient was considered initially immunocompetent, there was a significant drop in complement C3 0.5 g/L (negative <0.8 g/L) and C4 0.03 g/L (negative <0.10 g/L). Further laboratory testing showed hypogammaglobulinemia (22 mg/dL IgA (normal 22–149 mg/dL), 150 mg/dL IgG (normal 615–1530 mg/dL), 20 mg/dL IgM (normal 31–272 mg/dL)), and 20 mL/24 hrs α\\-1 antitrypsin clearance.\n\n【8】An upper digestive endoscopy was performed showing a whitish lace pattern and erythematous walls in the second portion of the duodenum. In addition, a colonoscopy showed hemorrhoidal packages, multiple ulcerated lesions in sigma, and elevated, pseudopolypoid, infiltrative lesions in cecum and ileocecal valve.\n\n【9】Since our patient lived in a tuberculosis endemic area and that the lesions simulated intestinal tuberculosis, empirical antituberculosis therapy (isoniazid 75 mg, rifampicin 150 mg, ethambutol 275 mg, and pyrazinamide 400 mg) was started until biopsy results came back.\n\n【10】Multiple cryptococci were found in samples taken from the cecum, sigma, and ileocecal valve using the techniques of immunohistochemistry CD68, Grocott stain, PAS stain, and Alcian blue stain . In addition, the presence of intestinal lymphangiectasia was confirmed with D240 staining .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Macrophages loaded with cryptococcal spores (arrowhead): (a) PAS staining, (b) Grocott staining, (c) Alcian blue staining, and (d) immunohistochemistry CD68.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Histopathological biopsy study obtained from the lower gastrointestinal tract.

Due to the severity of the presentation octreotide was started along with dietary treatment. Octreotide and oral fluconazole 600 mg were maintained for 90 days after discharge with favorable symptomatic evolution, additionally, following laboratory controls shown that albumin levels went back to normal.\n\n【14】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Cryptococcosis is one of the most frequent opportunistic fungal diseases. Its incidence in Latin America has been increasing, reaching approximately 5300 cases in 2017. However, intestinal dissemination is rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】An exhaustive literature review in the Medline databases was performed using the terms “gastrointestinal cryptococcosis” and “intestinal lymphangiectasia.” We identified a total of 10 case reports of intestinal cryptococcosis in the context of immunosuppressing conditions which are summarized in Table 1; however, we were unable to find reports similar to our case. The lack of literature on the coalescence of these conditions suggests that this work is the first description of intestinal cryptococcosis associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Case reports of intestinal cryptococcosis in the context of immunosuppressing conditions.</u>\n\n【18】The countries with the highest incidence of common presentations of Cryptococcosis are Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The infection occurs through contact with soil or eucalyptus trees contaminated with birds’ feces. Most of these cases occur in young male patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, and in much lesser proportion in immunocompetent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The infection involves the central nervous system (CNS) in almost 70% of cases, being the most common cause of meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients. Lung involvement is the second most common presentation and presents as infiltrations or granulomatous reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The increasing prevalence of patients diagnosed with AIDS has been proportional to the increase in opportunistic infections such as Cryptococcosis. The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has modified its presentation, resulting in atypical locations. Intestinal cryptococcosis is believed to be through direct inoculation rather than hematogenous dissemination since blood cultures were always negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The apparent immunocompetence of our patient and his unspecific symptomatology made his diagnosis a real challenge, misguiding the diagnostic suspicion towards more common gastrointestinal tract infections such as tuberculosis. Similar situations happened in a large number of reported cases of intestinal cryptococcosis, in which diagnosis occurred incidentally.\n\n【22】Out of 11 case reports of gastrointestinal cryptococcosis, only Sciaudone G presented an immunocompetent patient while the rest reported immunologically compromised patients. The correlation between immunocompromised and intestinal cryptococcosis is well documented. Patients with advanced stages of HIV (CD4 < 200), with malignant processes (solid or hematological tumors), treatment with immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>, organ-transplanted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, or cirrhotic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 12\\]</u> are considered as high-risk subjects.\n\n【23】Intestinal lymphangiectasia can produce a state of secondary immunodeficiency. The pathological dilation of lymphatic vessels in the intestinal wall, especially in the submucosa, causes chronic loss of lymph containing immunoglobulins and lymphocytes (predominantly naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells) and severe hypoalbuminemia. This state of secondary immunodeficiency is of difficult diagnosis and poses a high risk for opportunistic fungal infections such as cryptococcosis, as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Our patient’s age was accord with the average age of intestinal cryptococcosis presentation reported in the literature (37 years, ranging from 26 to 73 years) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Abdominal pain was the most common initial symptom in patients infected with Cryptococcus. The onset of pain in reported cases ranged from 2 days to 6 months; however, the majority exceeded 3 weeks. In addition, 66% of patients had fever at some point in the course of the illness associated with vomiting and nausea sporadically. Despite being an invasive intestinal pathology, only half of the patients had diarrhea, and only 25% had bloody diarrhea or melena. Any gastrointestinal organ can be affected.\n\n【26】Through endoscopy, suggestive lesions, as ulcers or abscesses, and signs of inflammation can be evidenced. However, ulcers can be similar to those produced in malignancy, other infections (Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania donovani, etc.), or Crohn’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 7, 11, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Although management varies depending on the localization of infection, fluconazole 400 to 800 mg once daily for 8 weeks followed by medium doses for 12 months can be used empirically. Intravenous amphotericin B is considered as the first line of treatment for disseminated Cryptococcus; however, its use in gastrointestinal cryptococcosis is not well studied (F. Cicora) (Rupashree Sundar).\n\n【28】The cryptococcal infection had high mortality rates in immunocompromised patients; however, it is important to consider that in the majority of reports the patient’s general condition was already severely compromised due to the advanced state of the underlying disease prior to infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:36:03", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:36:08", "cost": 4.748}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:36:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:36:01"}

She was awake and alert in the emergency room but was confused about her identity, past events in the last 2 days, and how she had arrived at the hospital. A head CT scan showed no acute disease. The psychiatry team was consulted, and it was discovered that Ms. A had a previous diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder (DID). Further investigation revealed that her family recently experienced enormous stress, which may have precipitated the current episode. During the psychiatric exam, she calmly sat with her eyes closed and insisted that they were already open when asked to open them. She also repeatedly fluctuated between referring to herself as “I” or “she.” When asked to write a complete sentence during the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam, Ms. A took the pen with her right hand and effortlessly wrote, from the right margin to the left, the mirror image of “I’m tired of being here.” When asked to write the sentence again, she wrote the same sentence in the same direction as fluidly as she had done before . She later reported that she was normally right handed. Ms. A ultimately received a 24/30 on the Mini-Mental State Exam, with points deducted in orientation to place and time and in short-term memory. The amnesia began to clear toward the evening, and Ms. A agreed to continue her care at a local community hospital.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Sentence written by Ms. A. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Mirror image of sentence. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】People with severe DID are known to fluctuate in various abilities, “such as fluency in a foreign language or athletic abilities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.” In some case studies, people with DID are able to switch handedness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

Introduction\n\n【3】Myocarditis is a disease characterised by a polymorphic clinical presentation and appears to be a major cause of sudden, unexpected death in adults aged <40 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A prominent lymphocytic infiltrate histologically characterizes the majority of biopsy-verified myocarditis. We report a fairly special case of an apparently lymphocytic myocarditis with reparative fibrosis, described using multimodality imaging and confirmed on histopathology.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 49-year-old farm laborer was referred to our hospital with complete heart block, incidentally discovered when he presented with persistent left sciatica despite analgesic treatment. No personal or familial history except a smoking habit was reported. The sciatica did not require immediate surgical management according to the physicians’ assessment after a spinal magnetic resonance imaging. Electrocardiogram  revealed complete atrioventricular block associated with atrial tachycardia. Thus, this patient was sent to our intensive care unit for cardiac investigation. Clinical history revealed New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II dyspnea, associated with clinical signs of global heart failure. Chest radiography demonstrated cardiomegaly and bilateral hilar overload. Transthoracic echocardiography  revealed extensive localized thickening of the right ventricle, right atrium, interatrial septum, and basal to mid interventricular septum associated with a pericardial effusion. The infiltration extended around the root of the pulmonary artery and aorta . Left ventricular systolic function was slightly impaired (ejection fraction = 54%). Analysis of tissue Doppler indices showed elevated left ventricular filling pressures (E/E′ ratio = 16.4). Blood sample tests found an isolated inflammatory syndrome: C-Reactive Protein raised to 50 mg/L. Nt-proBNP increased to 1150 pg/mL ( 𝑁 < 1 2 5  pg/mL). Serological tests for a bacterial, fungal, or immunological (including anti-nuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor) cause were negative. QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was negative, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme level was normal. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed to localize and characterize the nature of the tissue thickening. Four-chamber , apical short-axis, and long-axis (Movie 4) cine images were performed using steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine sequences. The right ventricular wall was akinetic, with preservation of apical contractility. Short-axis dark-blood T2-weighted  sequences confirmed concentric thickening and oedema of the right ventricle. First-pass perfusion  showed enhancement of the right ventricular and interventricular septum infiltration consistent with an active inflammatory process. Delayed enhancement CMR  sequences demonstrated widespread and heterogeneous enhancement of the right ventricle. Combined 通用删除7(英):<u>(18)</u>F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET)/computed tomography (CT) was performed to look for primary malignant lesion  showing moderate FDG uptake involving mainly the right heart chambers of the heart. This whole body exam did not detect any extracardiac locations of FDG uptake.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Twelve-lead ECG demonstrating a complete atrioventricular block. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Apical two-dimensional four-chamber (a) echocardiogram showing marked thickening of the right ventricle (arrow), right atrium (empty arrow), interatrial septum (empty arrowhead), and basal to mid interventricular septum (arrowhead) associated with a pericardial effusion.

Right ventricular myocardial biopsy and implantation of a dual-chamber epicardial pacemaker were performed via a sternal thoracotomy. Hematoxylin-eosin-saffron stained sections of the tissue sample showed a granulomatous reaction consisting of nodular cellular infiltrates (histiocytes associated with lymphocytic elements) with an abundant fibrotic reaction . Immunohistochemistry revealed a prevalence of T lymphocytes (CD3 positive; Figure 5(c)) mixed with B lymphocytes (CD20 positive), histiocytes (CD68 positive; Figure 5(d)) and a few plasma cells (CD138 positive). Neither giant cells nor epithelioid cells were observed, thus rejecting the diagnoses of giant cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis. Vessels were not specifically concerned with the cellular infiltrates, so that a diagnosis of vasculitis was also excluded. Congo red and hematoxylin-eosin stained sections did not show amyloid deposits. Nested/reverse transcription-PCR did not detect any genomes of enterovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus B19, or human herpes virus type 6.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | Low (a) and high (b) magnifications of hematoxylin-eosin-safron stained sections showing nodular cellular infiltrates with abundant fibrosis; immunohistochemistry revealing a prevalence of CD3-positive T lymphocytes (c) and some CD68-positive histiocytes (d). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】At followup twelve months later, the patient described NYHA class II dyspnea, with no clinical signs of heart failure. Echocardiography revealed persistent myocardial infiltration, although the pericardial effusion had resolved. The patient remained pacemaker dependent with underlying complete heart block, which is probably the consequence of infiltration of the cardiac conduction system with granulomatous tissue. Nt-proBNP had decreased to 550 pg/mL.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】We report a fairly special case of lymphocytic myocarditis progressing to a fibrotic stage, described using multi-modality imaging and confirmed on histopathology. This paper presents an uncommon diagnosis with a probable guarded prognosis.\n\n【15】First, although MRI and other imaging modalities findings are relatively nonspecific, we can notice the ability of dark-blood T2-weighted and first-pass perfusion imaging to detect, respectively, oedema and enhancement of the right ventricular free wall and the interventricular septum infiltration consistent with an active inflammatory process. Consequently, we decided a corticosteroid therapy in order to clear inflammation. Furthermore, we confirm in this paper CMR’s ability to depict myocardial fibrosis on delayed enhancement imaging. We can suppose that this fibrous infiltration of the right ventricle and basal to mid interventricular septum is responsible for the persistence of conduction disturbances. Thus, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging detected oedema, residual inflammatory process, and myocardial fibrosis, which may influence patient’s management. We regret that a second CMR control could not be performed because of the pacemaker.\n\n【16】Secondly, this patient presented incidentally with apparently idiopathic cardiac granulomatosis, probably being longstanding. We used the term “granulomatous” because of the nature of nodular lesions and the presence of histiocytes associated with lymphocytic elements. Cardiac sarcoidosis and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis are usually clinicopathologic entities evocated in this situation. Okura et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> demonstrated, in a large series of patients, histological differences between cardiac sarcoidosis and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis: the first has more granulomas and fibrosis, while the second one more necrosis, foci of lymphocytic myocarditis and eosinophils. The number of giant cells is equivalent in the two entities. Presentation with heart failure predicted idiopathic giant cell myocarditis, whereas presentation with heart block or more than nine weeks of symptoms is associated with cardiac sarcoidosis. There is still an open debate as to whether idiopathic giant cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis are separate disorders. However, in this case, neither giant cells nor epithelioid cells were observed, thus rejecting the diagnoses of giant cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis. Thus, a viral-negative lymphocytic myocarditis which had progressed to a fibrotic and granulomatous stage was the most plausible diagnosis, although we recognize that infiltration of the aortic root and the right atrium is very unusual in case of myocarditis. Surprisingly, in this patient presenting with chronic myocarditis and persistent inflammation, nested/reverse transcription-PCR did no detect any genomes of virus. Gutberlet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> observed that viral genomes were amplified at nested PCR assay in 49 (59%) of the 83 patients presenting with chronic myocarditis. Parvovirus B19 was the most frequently detected virus. Because lymphocytic myocarditis has multiple etiologies, therapy should be individualized according to the specific etiology. Unfortunately, efficacy of most therapies used or proposed for use in lymphocytic myocarditis has not been proven. Until this proof is available, specific and nonspecific antiviral measures should be considered for use in those patients who present with documented ongoing viral infection. Likewise, appropriate antimicrobial is always indicated in lymphocytic myocarditis caused by bacterial and other organisms. The area of greatest controversy is the use of immunosuppressive and other immunomodulatory therapies for noninfectious and postinfectious myocarditis. In our case we hypothesize that corticosteroid therapy may be effective in clearing the residual inflammatory process. Healing of myocarditis lesions may result in some degrees of fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. Earlier series have shown that symptoms do not reflect the extent of lymphocytic infiltrate and fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, we can notice that our patient presented with severe heart failure, and in parallel the endomyocardial biopsy showed significant fibrosis.\n\n【17】Thirdly, this paper presents an uncommon diagnosis with a probable guarded prognosis. Magnani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported in 112 patients with histopathologic confirmation of myocarditis that 88 (79%) and 63 (56%) were alive without cardiac transplantation at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Furthermore, Davidoff et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> observed that the presence of atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker insertion was predictive of a subsequent fatal outcome in both giant cell and lymphocytic myocarditis.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】We report a fairly special case of lymphocytic myocarditis progressing to a fibrotic stage, described using multi-modality imaging and confirmed on histopathology. The combination of CMR with various image acquisition sequences associated with other imaging modalities provides a noninvasive morphological assessment and tissue characterization of myocardial involvement.

The oral cavity is rarely affected by this infestation and the circumstances which can lead to oral myiasis include persistent mouth opening together with poor hygiene, or facial traumatism. We present a case of oral myiasis by larvae of Lucilia sericata, a species present in the Iberian Peninsula, in a hospitalized patient with surgical problems.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case History\n\n【3】A male aged 32 years was admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from General Surgery in a tertiary hospital (Hospital Virgen del Puerto, Plasencia, Extremadura, Spain). Case history revealed intestinal pathology with peritonitis, and laparotomy with intestinal resection, approximately a year previously. Two months before, the patient presented a new subocclusive condition, with gastroparesis, esophageal motor disorder, and intestinal myopathy. The patient was admitted to surgery with pain in the left iliac fossa compatible with acute peritonitis and perforation of the hollow viscus. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and the affected intestinal loops were resected. Two days later a further surgical intervention was necessary because of feverish syndrome and abdominal distension. During this period the patient remained under the effects of sedation. Abscesses and peritonitis with intestinal block were found, which prompted the patient’s transfer to ICU. After 12 h in ICU a further intervention due to biliary peritonitis was required; the omentum was seen to be invaded by abscesses, requiring it to resected, a jejunostomy was performed, and the abdomen was left open. Antibiotherapy was administered contributing to improve the patient’s evolution, with diminished fever and signs of inflammation. In the evolutionary period of 15 days following admission, the nurse reported mobile “maggots” in the patient’s oral cavity, nasopharynx and oropharynx, and the presence of perilarval reaction. Treatment consisted of total mechanical removal of the larvae by combining manual extraction with tweezers and aspiration after having washed the infected area with water and povidone iodine. The patient’s clinical condition was controlled without the appearance of further signs of infestation.\n\n【4】Several fly larvae were sent to the laboratory, white in color, without legs, and with a smooth surface . The larvae presented 12 segments: the first of which had a pair of lateral papillae (anterior spiracles) with digitiform prolongations; the last segment having D-shaped posterior spiracles with 3 straight perimetral slots, not sinuous, and dark in color. The perimetral membrane is closed with a button which is especially evident when observed with low microscopic magnification (10x). These structures led us to identify this larva as part of the Calliphoridae family, belonging to the genus Lucilia.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Aspect and evolution of the larvae of Lucilia sericata in our laboratory.

The larva moved freely in the agar, and after about 10 days a dark brown structure appeared stuck on the edge of the plaque. This pupa was placed on a clean petri plate at room temperature. After a few days, the adult insect or imago appeared. Based on its subcostal sclerite, which was yellow in color, its meron structure, and the analysis of its wing venation, it was identified as Lucilia sericata, a species present in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n【7】#### 2\\.

We present an 18-year-old high school student who presented with a sore throat, macular rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fevers, and joint pains. He presented with acute kidney injury and confusion with multiple tests and was eventually diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Presentation\n\n【3】An 18-year-old African male high school student with no prior comorbid conditions presented with a 2-day history of tonsillitis and was noted to have a macular rash that started on his chest and extended to his arm. He had received symptomatic treatment by a school clinician with oral chlorohexidine and lozenges. Three days into the initial symptom, he developed abdominal cramping and multiple episodes of non-bloody diarrhea, watery in nature, without nausea nor vomiting. He also had fevers and joint pains (both wrist, elbows, and knees). He was taken to a nearby health facility, where he was noted to have a high temperature and tachycardia. Within 24 hours in this facility, he developed confusion and was reported to have increasing creatinine, which rose from 200 μmol/L to 400 μmol/L. Treatment received included ceftriaxone 2 grams once a day for three days, paracetamol 1 g three times a day, loperamide 2 mg with every episode of diarrhea, and one dose of IV methylprednisolone 1 g. Given his deterioration, he was transferred to our facility for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n【4】On arrival at this hospital, he was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, febrile at 40 degrees Celsius, hypotensive at 70/40 mmHg, and desaturating to 86% on room air. His GCS was 14/15; respiratory exam revealed bilaterally coarse crepitations throughout the lung fields with an audible S3 gallop rhythm on cardiovascular examination. Per abdomen was distended, tense with hypoactive bowel sounds. The musculoskeletal examination was unremarkable. He underwent acute management with fluid resuscitation, an urgent central line was placed, and he was initiated on inotropic support at 0.4 mcg per kilogram per minute.\n\n【5】The initial laboratory findings included a full hemogram which depicted an elevated white cell count of 27.12 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dl (normocytic normochromic), and platelets of 281 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Inflammatory markers were elevated with a procalcitonin of 71.58 ng/ml and C-reactive protein of 287 mg/L. The kidney fuctions were deranged with a creatinine of 494mmol/L, urea 26.70 mmlols/L, sodium 128 mmol/L, potassium 4.87mmol/L, and bicarbonate 15.5 mmol/L (blood gas analysis supoorted a metobaolic acisosis with a pH7.33, PCO2 23 PO2 122 and HCO3- 19.8). His liver function test represented ischemic hepatitis with an elevated AST of 1461 units/L ALT 812 units/L normal bilirubin (hepatitis screens A, B, and C were negative, including an HIV test). Urine analysis showed proteinuria with protein three-plus and blood four plus (with no red blood cells) and a urine albumin creatine ratio confirming proteinuria of 52.28 mg/mmol. The cardiac markers were elevated with a troponin of 17,137 ng/ml with an elevated creatine kinase of more than 7800 units/L. At this point, a diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease and rheumatic fever was entertained; an ASOT titer was obtained, being negative.\n\n【6】His radiological investigation included a chest X-ray that showed a feature of pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly; a 2D echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a low ejection fraction of 30 to 35% and normal valves. A CT scan abdomen showed distended bowel with splenic and renal infarcts as highlighted in Figures 1 and 2, and an HRCT redemonstrated the cardiomegaly and bi-basal lung atelectasis.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showing multiple hypodense wedge-shaped parenchymal defects involving the cortex and medulla consistent with renal infarcts (black arrow).</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showing hypodense pyramidal wedge-shaped defect consistent with splenic infarcts (black arrow).</u>\n\n【9】Multiple differential diagnoses were entertained at this point, such as vasculitis (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, medium-sized vasculitis) and multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, which has been superimposed by septic shock. Within a few hours, the patient deteriorated, requiring intubation, and his norepinephrine requirements had increased to 0.7 mcg per kilogram per minute. He had been initiated on meropenem one gram three times a day and was started on urgent dialysis to help with the pulmonary edema, and supportive management was commenced for the fevers (given liver dysfunction, paracetamol was avoided, and other measures were integrated, which included cooling and icepacks). Because of the above differential diagnosis, an autoimmune panel was sent. Complement 3 and Complement 4 (C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>) were low at 0.51 g/L and 0.04 g/L, respectively. The patient was initiated on a low-dose steroid pulse at 250 mg once a day and, due to the high risk of immunosuppression secondary to the steroids, was given broader cover with vancomycin 500 mg twice a day (renally adjusted doses); the rest of the autoimmune panel results are as follows: positive beta2-glycoprotein IgA antiphospholipid antibody and negative ANA, antiDS DNA, ENA, pANCA, and cANCA. COVID-19 PCR from tracheal aspirate and nasal swab was negative. However, to our surprise, the COVID-19 antibody test was positive, giving us strong evidence that our patient was suffering from the multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. By this point, all cultures, including blood and urine, had no growth.\n\n【10】With the first pulse of steroids, the patient showed marked improvement with a decreasing pressor requirement from 0.7 mcgs of norepinephrine to 0.16 mcgs. Currently, the patient is doing well and has been successfully extubated, off inotropic support, with good urine output. He has remarkably overcome an acute process with four days of treatment with antibiotics and steroids and will continue on a tapering dose of steroids. He was successfully discharged from the hospital with some mild left leg weakness. As demonstrated by the MRI in Figures 3 and 4, the brain had developed small lacunar infarcts with residual neurological deficits.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 ADC mapping with an area of low signal intensity (left image orange arrow).

Discussion\n\n【14】Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is where you have multiple organ inflammation, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. COVID-19 pneumonia in children presents very mild symptoms and can often be asymptomatic. There is a specific criterion that should be met for the diagnosis of MISC. As per the European and US center of disease prevention and control the diagnostic criteria is as follows: <21 years of age, fever for more than one day, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and more than two organ failure with a positive SARS-COVID 19 PCR or positive antigen test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As seen in our case, the criteria were met given that the patient was 18 years old and had increased inflammatory markers evidenced by increased CRP and ferritin levels. The patient also had multiple organ failure including a positive antigen test, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain.\n\n【15】The pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia in children is similar to that of adults, where viral entry is via angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2, the difference being that fewer receptors in children give milder symptoms. In MIS-C, once the viral entry has been established, the early infection activates the macrophages after the T-helper cells causing cytokine release 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. One after that develops a hyperimmune state by activating the B-cells causing the production of autoantibodies. The hyperimmune state leads to autoantibodies attacking the endothelial cell and gastrointestinal cells; myocardial damage’s exact mechanism is unknown, but one can present with myocarditis or acute ischemic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The clinical presentation of MIS-C is a multisystemic disease, one of the most common manifestations is fevers occurring in 97–100% of patients, and dermatological manifestation includes rash and conjunctivitis (30–94%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestation are the most common presenting complaints which include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Cardiac involvement includes features of myocarditis and ischemic events; around 31–100% of the patients may have left ventricular diastolic function evidenced by an echocardiogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thrombotic complications like splenic infarction and cerebral strokes are also common manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. On the other hand, renal infarctions are rare, and only a few cases reported in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have developed renal infarctions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. Based on this evidence, one can see that the above patient presented with almost all the clinical signs making the diagnosis even stronger.\n\n【17】Acute kidney injury is prevalent amongst the SARS-COVID-19 patients. AKI and renal parenchymal disease may be caused by the ACE-2 receptors on the kidney parenchyma, causing microvascular injury triggered by the cytokine storm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. As noted in outpatient, there was proteinuria, which has been reported in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The theory is that viral replication occurs in the podocytes causing damage that can ensue in proteinuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Renal infarction resulting in AKI is rare; studies have shown renal infarction resulting in AKI but none requiring hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This case stands out as it is one of the only cases of renal infarction requiring renal replacement therapy. Most cases of renal infarction lead to AKI with no additional intervention required.\n\n【18】There is a unique coloration between SARS-COVID-19 pneumonia and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; there can be an elevated anticardiolipin IgA antibody or an anti-B2-glycoprotein I IgA and IgG antibodies (as seen in our patient); this manifestation can lead to cerebral vascular infarctions, although studies do not support this hypothesis as in antiphospholipid syndrome it is the IgM and IgG titers that collate to thrombotic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Further studies need to be conducted to prove the thrombotic sequela amongst those with increased IgA titer, as clearly evidenced not only in our patient but in other case series conducted by Zhang et al. where all three patients had thrombotic events (multiple cerebral infarctions) and positive anticardiolipin IgA, anti-β2-glycoprotein I IgA, and IgG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【19】MIS-C and COVID-19 pneumonia is a pediatric syndrome characterized by increased inflammatory markers, fever, and multiorgan failure. There is a significant increase in the risk of morbidity and mortality, but some cases have a reasonable response rate, as seen in our patient. The unique events of positive IgA antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombotic events as seen in our patient may need further studies to prove any correlations.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】COVID-19 pneumonia can lead to MIS-C resulting in multiple organ inflammation. Patients with MIS-C are more prone to thrombotic events and multiple organ failures. Therapies with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins have been shown to improve outcomes significantly. AKI caused by renal infarction is rare; this may be the only case resulting in renal infarction requiring renal replacement therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:27", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:40", "cost": 13.211}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:40", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:26"}

They have widespread environmental distribution and have been isolated from water, soil, and plants as well as from some hospital devices such as intravenous catheters and water contained in humidifier reservoirs used in respiratory treatment. The genus Comamonas originally contained the following species: acidovorans, testosteroni, kerstersii, terrigena, denitrificans, and nitrativorans. It now contains 17 species, while acidovorans spp. have been reclassified as Delftia acidovorans. In spite of its uncommon human pathogenesis, there are few reports on the aggressive manner of it as an opportunistic pathogen, mostly related to testosteroni spp. We present a case of polymicrobial bacteremia involving Comamonas testosteroni. The aim of this case report is to alert clinicians to the potential diagnosis of bloodstream infections caused by uncommon pathogens.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Comamonas testosteroni, formerly known as Pseudomonas testosteroni, is an aerobic, motile, nonspore forming, ubiquitous Gram-negative organism. Although it has low virulence potency, there are few reports on its involvement in human infections. It became clinically important after 1987, when reports began accumulating on human infections such as cellulitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, endophthalmitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, tenosynovitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, and pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, cases of bloodstream infections caused by Comamonas testosteroni have been infrequently reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8–12\\]</u>. The name of testosteroni was given due to its characteristic of utilizing carbon from the metabolism of testosterone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, although this property has also been demonstrated by some Pseudomonas spp. and fungi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Some strains of Comamonas testosteroni have acquired the plasmid-mediated blaNDM1, gene that confers broad spectrum antimicrobial resistance thus potentially hampering treatment options in the event where this bacterium causes human infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In this report, we present an uncommon case of polymicrobial bacteremia involving Comamonas testosteroni with a detailed review of the literature.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】An 80-year-old African American female, morbidly obese, was brought to emergency department complaining of generalized body aches (predominantly in shoulders) and nondocumented fevers at home for about 1 week. Her past medical history was significant for systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hiatal hernia, osteoarthritis, and cholelithiasis (s/p cholecystectomy). On arrival to the hospital, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 150/77 mmHg, a regular heart rate of a 106 beats/minute, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths/minute, a temperature of a 100.8°F, and an oxygen saturation of 96% breathing ambient air.\n\n【6】Remarkable laboratory findings on admission were a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14, 500/mm<sup>3</sup> (4.8–10.8), a sodium level of 129 mmol/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(135–147)</u>, a potassium level of 5.5 mmol/L (3.5–5.3), and a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL (0.8–2.0). C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrosedimentation rate (ESR) levels were both elevated at 152.7 mg/L (1.0–4.0) and 130 mm/h 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–20)</u>, respectively. Her urine analysis showed positive leukoesterase and a WBC count of 10–15/hpf 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–5)</u>. Coagulation and liver profiles were within normal limits. Bilateral shoulder X-ray demonstrated degenerative changes, with a right rotator cuff tendinitis but no fractures. Chest radiography revealed no infiltrates.\n\n【7】She was admitted to the medicine ward with the presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), and empiric antimicrobial therapy was initiated with ceftriaxone 2 grams intravenously daily. Blood cultures drawn on admission grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and antimicrobial therapy was stream lined to nafcillin 2 grams intravenously every 4 hours. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no vegetations. On day 3 of admission, her hospital course was complicated by worsening leukocytosis and a transient episode of hypotension which responded to intravenous fluids therapy. At that time, a new set of blood cultures was obtained from which Comamonas testosteroni was isolated (sensitive to ceftazidime, carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Antimicrobial therapy was then escalated to cefazolin 1 gram intravenously every 8 hours plus doripenem 250 mg intravenously every 8 hours. Abdomen, pelvis, and chest computed tomography (CT) were obtained, demonstrating the presence of diverticulosis but no abscess formation or mass. Repeated blood cultures were negative, and the patient was discharged home to complete a total of 4-week course of intravenous antimicrobial therapy.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】This is one of fewer than 15 cases of Comamonas testosteroni bacteremia reported in the literature and the first reported case of Comamonas testosteroni and Staphylococcus aureus polymicrobial bloodstream infection, according to a MEDLINE search using the words “Comamonas” and “bacteremia” and “bloodstream infection.” Approximately 35 cases of infections involving Comamonas testosteroni have been reported in the medical literature. Majority of infections are community-acquired rather than nosocomial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>, and most of the patients reported had some degree of immunosuppression such as malignancy, chronic liver disease, and end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 11, 12\\]</u>. Bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of infections caused by Comamonas spp. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Based on results from previous reports, majority of the 14 reported patients with bacteremia caused by Comamonas testosteroni were males, their median age was 47 years (range, newborn–89), only one patient died, and predisposing factors for infection were not identified in two of them. Most of the patients responded well to appropriate antimicrobial therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Comamonas spp. isolates are usually susceptible to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, cephalosporins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The patient discussed in this report did not have any obvious source of infection. She did not have central venous catheters, and the abdominal imaging did not evidence any acute inflammatory process or mass. Her immunosuppressive state was limited to diabetes mellitus, which might have played a role as a possible predisposing factor. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that the most likely source might have been the right shoulder rotator cuff tendinitis. Although this hypothesis cannot be proven, it is supported by the fact that the patient reported shoulder pain, the CRP and ESR levels were markedly elevated, and the right shoulder imaging showed rotator cuff tendinitis. In 2000, Isotalo et al. reported a case of polymicrobial tenosynovitis, involving an organism most likely to be related to Comamonas spp. based on biochemical factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. If proven, our patient may have been only the second case of tenosynovitis caused by Comamonas spp. reported in the literature. We also postulate that the second likely mode of bacteremia in this case could have been dissemination of Comamonas testosteroni from the bowel following gastrointestinal translocation, given the finding of extensive diverticulosis demonstrated in the abdominal imaging.\n\n【12】Polymicrobial bacteremia involving Comamonas testosteroni have been reported in association with Streptococcus parasanguis and Ralstonia pickettii 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Two other cases of polymicrobial bacteremia involving Comamonas spp. (Delftia acidovorans (formerly known as Comamonas acidovorans) and Comamonas kerstersii) were previously reported in association with Streptococcus agalactiae and Bacteroides fragilis, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first case of bloodstream infection involving Comamonas testosteroni and Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n【13】In this report, we have highlighted an unusual cause of bloodstream infection. Comamonas spp. should be kept in mind as a rare cause of bacteremia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:46:20", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:46:51", "cost": 31.111}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:46:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:46:19"}

Primitive malignant heart tumours are rare, specific cases. The presence of cardiac metastases, often in the pericardium, besides indicating disseminated oncological disease, represents a diagnostic challenge since they tend to be asymptomatic. Malignant cutaneous melanoma (MCM) is the neoplasm that most often affects the heart. Patients and Methods. The authors describe a case report of a 59-year-old female patient with a history of non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and remitting cutaneous malignant melanoma who underwent skin excision, lymphadenectomy, and adjuvant chemotherapy in 1996. In April 2014, she resorted to emergency service due to epigastric pain and progressive tiredness. Due to the persistence of the complaints, abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed a large pericardial effusion, corroborated later by teleradiography and echocardiography. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, which isolated neoplastic cells. A computed tomography study of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed bilateral and pericardial pleural effusion, as well as alterations suggestive of pericardial and pulmonary metastasis. Later, fine-needle aspiration puncture of the left posterior cervical nodule confirmed histologically malignant melanoma metastasis. Discussion. Given the natural history of melanoma that when metastasized has an overall survival of 15–20% for 5 years, its metastatic spread may occur several years after its surgical excision. Thus, patients with a history of melanoma and heart failure who develop new cardiac symptoms of unknown aetiology should undergo imaging studies such as echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primary cardiac tumours are specific cases, and in adults, the most frequent malignant tumours are angiosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and fibrosarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Regarding benign neoplasms, myxomas and lipomas are the most prevalent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The heart and pericardium are often affected in the context of disseminated metastatic tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–6\\]</u>. Secondary cardiac metastasis is found in 20% of autopsies and approximately 10% of metastatic cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–6\\]</u>. Any cardiac structure may be metastasized, but the epicardium is the preferred site, as described in 75.5% of the cases, and at least half of these are accompanied by pericardial effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. The main forms of neoplastic dissemination are essentially by lymphatic route, hematogenous route, and contiguous extension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The main malignancies with frequent cardiac involvement are the lung and breast cancers, mainly due to their anatomical proximity and high prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 6, 7\\]</u>. Nonepithelial tumours have cardiac involvement in 22.7% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Lymphomas, in the context of secondary immunodeficiency, also present an extensive cardiac involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Cardiac metastases indicate a state of advanced oncological disease, which usually are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. In some cases, they may manifest as arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, pericardial effusion, and acute heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–5\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Cardiac tamponade as the first manifestation of neoplasia is unlikely since, in addition to pericardial infiltration by malignant cells, the presence of other circumstances, such as an acute event or even lymphatic obstruction, is necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 59-year-old female patient presented with a personal history of non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, usually medicated with metformin, perindopril, and simvastatin.\n\n【10】The patient attended to emergency service (ES) due to epigastric pain and feeling of fullness, for which was submitted to dioctyl sulfosuccinate enema and later discharged. Due to the persistence of the complaints and, now, with progressive tiredness, the patient frequented the ES two days later, where she underwent an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed pericardial effusion.\n\n【11】Objectively, on admission, the patient was conscious, oriented, collaborative, eupneic at rest and hemodynamically stable with rhythmic heart tones, no murmurs, decreased vesicular murmur in the right pulmonary base, free and defenceless abdomen, and lower limbs without oedema.\n\n【12】The patient displayed on electrocardiogram a sinus rhythm, 90 bpm heart rate, low amplitude QRS complexes, and nonspecific alterations in ventricular repolarization; chest X-ray was performed with increased cardiothoracic index and bilateral pleural effusion, especially at the base of the right hemithorax; echocardiogram was with large pericardial effusion “swinging heart” and partial collapse of the right heart chambers. The patient is admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit, in the context of cardiac tamponade.\n\n【13】During hospitalization, the patient underwent: pericardiocentesis, with a total drainage of 1250 cc, whose fluid, according to the pathological anatomy, evidenced neoplastic cells. She also underwent a thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography which revealed bilateral pleural effusion, with adjacent parenchymal atelectasis, slight pericardial effusion , and zones on the left side, with clear pericardial thickening suggestive of pericardial metastasis, after intravenous contrast. Several nodules in all lung lobes were indicative of metastases. The patient also underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a cervical nodule, which has shown to be a melanoma metastasis. Later on, it was found out that the patient had malignant melanoma with inguinal ganglion metastasis in 1995 and completed chemotherapy, cutaneous excision, and lymphadenectomy in 1996.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Thoracic computed tomography showing the presence of pericardial effusion.</u>\n\n【15】During hospitalization, the patient had several periods of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, despite chemical cardioversion with amiodarone. The patient was discharged with oral anticoagulation and digoxin, as an effective heart rate management agent.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Melanoma most often affects the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Its cardiac involvement is identified in more than 50% of autopsies, but it is challenging to diagnose since it spreads asymptomatically to the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 7\\]</u>. It is even more difficult to establish the prime diagnosis of melanoma through cardiac metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Once metastasized, the survival rate of patients with stage IV melanoma is very low as their 5-year survival is 15 to 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7, 8\\]</u>. It is metastasized via the hematogenous pathway, by the coronary arteries or the vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. Myocardial and pericardial involvement implies extracardiac metastatic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 7\\]</u>. Like cardiac tamponade, the clinical presentation of metastatic melanoma through cardiac arrhythmia is rare. To date, the arrhythmogenic mechanism of melanoma is unknown. It is admitted that there is intramyocardial invasion with compromise of the right atrium impairing the electrical myocardial conduction system. The maintenance of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented in case may be explained by the electrical myocardial alterations due to melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Pericardiocentesis besides being lifesaving in the context of cardiac tamponade also allows establishing the etiological diagnosis. Treatment in these scenarios is limited to serous sclerosis or the establishment of pericardial windows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】New therapeutic regimens for malignant cutaneous melanoma (MCM)—immunotherapy, BRAF, and MEK inhibitors—demonstrated a significant improvement in relapse-free survival, although they are associated with cardiotoxicity. Among the documented adverse effects, the prolongation of QTc implies a monthly electrocardiographic evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The authors intend to emphasize that given the natural and unpredictable history of melanoma, the patient’s history must be taken into account. Cardiac events can occur several years after surgical excision of skin melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Due to the abovementioned conditions, all patients with the diagnosis of MCM should be followed and treated by a multidisciplinary team with Oncologists, Cardiologists, Radiologists, Endocrinologists, Surgeons, and Internal Medicine specialists, for proper treatment of the disease and adverse events from its’ treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:09:55", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:02", "cost": 7.376}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:09:54"}

Such arteries can also develop atherosclerotic lesions. This report describes the case of a 75-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital due to exertional dyspnea. The right coronary artery was found to originate from the left coronary sinus and exhibit tight stenosis due to atherosclerosis, causing effort angina pectoris. This case highlights the fact that coronary artery anomalies can cause angina pectoris via both atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic effects, and successful revascularization was achieved noninvasively via percutaneous coronary angioplasty.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The incidence of congenital coronary artery anomalies has been reported at less than 1%, indicating that such anatomical abnormalities are relatively rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Such conditions are characterized by abnormal location of the orifice of a coronary artery, including anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA). Sometimes, these abnormal anatomical features can lead to life-threatening presentations such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmia and even sudden death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery (AAORCA) describes the abnormal location of the orifice of the right coronary artery (RCA) in the left coronary sinus, an abnormality shown to carry a risk of myocardial infarction and sudden death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Such arteries can also develop atherosclerotic lesions. Although some studies have reported successful revascularization of these coronary abnormalities using surgical coronary bypass or percutaneous coronary angioplasty, the optimal revascularization strategy remains unclear. This report describes the case of a 75-year-old man with AAORCA and effort angina pectoris related to an atherosclerotic lesion in the RCA, which was successfully treated noninvasively using percutaneous coronary angioplasty.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】A 75-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to exertional dyspnea that had been manifesting for several months. The patient had coronary risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history of coronary disease, and past history of smoking, and was taking medication prescribed by his regular physician (nifedipine 20 mg/day for hypertension; bezafibrate 400 mg/day for hyperlipidemia). On admission, physical examination and laboratory data revealed no specific findings: white blood cell count, 3990 cells/μL; hemoglobin, 14.8 g/dL; platelets, 26.7 × 104 cells/μL; glucose, 95 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 14 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.71 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate, 81.7 mL/min; uric acid, 6.0 mg/dL; aspartate transaminase, 21 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 15 U/L; total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; creatine kinase, 85 IU/L; creatine kinase-MB, 8 IU/L; C-reactive protein, 0.1 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 150 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 63 mg/dL; triglycerides, 113 mg/dL; glycated hemoglobin, 5.4%; brain-type natriuretic peptide, 24 pg/mL. However, the exercise stress test revealed slight ST depression in leads V4-6 on electrocardiography. Based on the clinical symptoms, the patient was suspected of coronary artery disease. Adenosine triphosphate-stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging revealed inferolateral wall ischemia. Coronary computed tomography indicated that the RCA originated from the left coronary sinus and passed between the aorta and the pulmonary artery . Total occlusion in the midportion of the abnormal RCA and 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) were suspected. The RCA lesion had atherosclerotic findings such as spotty calcification and mild positive remodeling . The patient was diagnosed with effort angina pectoris and underwent coronary angiography, which revealed tight stenosis at the LAD-D1 bifurcation and a completely occluded RCA originating from the left coronary sinus. The abnormal RCA had multiple collaterals from the LAD and left circumflex branch . Because the patient had a coronary artery anomaly and multivessel stenosis, coronary artery bypass grafting was proposed for revascularization, but the patient refused any surgically invasive treatment. Therefore, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed for revascularization. The following revascularization systems were used: right femoral artery approach; guiding catheter, 7-Fr Amplatz Left 2 Mach 1 (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA); guide wire, Grand Slam, XT-R, and Sion blue (both from Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan); microcatheter, Mizuki (Kaneka Medical, Osaka, Japan) and Caravel (Asahi Intecc); balloon, Ikazuchi 1.0 × 10 mm (Kaneka Medical), Tazuna 2.0 × 15 mm (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and Raiden 3.5 × 10 mm (Kaneka Medical); stent, Ultimaster 3.0 × 18 mm (Terumo Corporation); and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheter, 40 MHz rotational OptiCross (Boston Scientific). Cannulating the guiding catheter to the anomalous orifice of the RCA was difficult, and it was not possible to achieve adequate backup support . Using the XT-R guide wire, the Mizuki microcatheter could not be passed though the chronic total occlusion lesion until it was replaced with a Caravel microcatheter. The wire was then changed to Sion blue . IVUS revealed diffuse eccentric calcified plaque. The intramural course of the proximal ectopic artery was elliptical with some lateral compression. However, the stenosis of the proximal intramural course was not so severe that we did not deploy the stent in the proximal portion . Multiple ballooning and angioplasty with a drug-eluting stent were performed , and an optimal result was obtained . At the same time, PCI was performed for LAD revascularization, and an optimal result was obtained . No exertional dyspnea was noted following PCI. At approximately one year after intervention, exercise stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging and coronary angiography revealed no in-stent restenosis or ischemia. The patient expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the intervention.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Coronary computed tomography revealing that the RCA originates from the left coronary sinus and passes between two great vessels.

Discussion\n\n【17】This case illustrates the possibility that coronary artery anomalies can be complicated with atherosclerotic lesions and can cause angina pectoris. PCI may represent a suitable option for the noninvasive treatment of such abnormal arteries.\n\nAAOCA represents a congenital coronary artery anomaly in which the artery originates from the contralateral aortic sinus. Thus, AAORCA describes the abnormal location of the RCA orifice in the left coronary sinus. The mortality rates associated with AAOCA have been reported at 0–50% for RCA abnormalities and 30–100% for left coronary artery abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The interarterial course of the RCA, which runs between the aorta and pulmonary artery (as in the present case), is considered malignant because it carries a risk of myocardial ischemia and sudden death even in the absence of atherosclerosis. Several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the mechanism by which such abnormalities cause ischemia in the absence of atherosclerosis: compression of the anomalous artery between the aorta and pulmonary artery (especially during exercise), compression of the anomalous artery by the aortic commissure, and angulation of the coronary artery origin with increased aortic wall tension or intramural course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. In contrast, some reports highlight the possibility that the proximal portion of the anomalous RCA could be more susceptible to atherosclerosis due to shear stress and vascular endothelium dysfunction caused by compression or by the anatomical feature itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Some reports of acute myocardial infarction with AAORCA indicated that the atherosclerotic culprit lesion was mostly seen at the proximal portion of the anomalous artery (75%). It is suspected that such anatomical abnormalities increase the risk of plaque formation and progression of atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. In patients with coronary anomaly, both atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic effects may lead to coronary disease. In the present case, coronary computed tomography and IVUS revealed the presence of an atherosclerotic lesion in the anomalous RCA. The IVUS findings also revealed the intramural course of the proximal ectopic artery was elliptical with some lateral compression. The severe stenosis of the intramural course of the proximal ectopic artery was recommended to deploy the stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However, in the present case, the stenosis of the proximal intramural course was not so severe that we did not deploy the stent in the proximal portion. The patient had no symptoms or signs of ischemia after PCI. The abnormal origin of the RCA may have promoted atherosclerosis development in this patient|.\n\n【19】Coronary revascularization is recommended as class I in patients with RCA originating anomalously and passing between the aorta and pulmonary artery, with evidence of myocardial ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the present case, the patient needed revascularization because the RCA ran between the aorta and pulmonary artery, with evidence of ischemia on stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. Coronary bypass surgery is usually selected for such coronary revascularization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 13, 14\\]</u>. However, an increasing number of reports have described the efficacy of PCI in such patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Because of the unusual anatomical features of anomalous coronary arteries, PCI may be technically challenging. Regarding the selection of the guiding catheter, if the ostium of the anomalous RCA is above the sinotubular junction, an AL-type guiding catheter is likely suitable for PCI. If the ostium of the anomalous RCA is below the sinotubular junction within the left sinus of valsalva, the anomalous RCA will present an acute takeoff angle of the orifice and the vessel course, which was also noted in our patient. Thus, guiding support is poor due to the noncoaxial engagement of most currently available guiding catheters. Successful revascularization in such patients requires adequate techniques such as the deep-seated guiding catheter technique, the buddy wire technique, the anchor balloon techniques, or using a large-caliber guiding catheter, an ST01™ catheter, or a GuideLiner™ catheter with the mother-and-child technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–19\\]</u>. Angelini et al. used dedicated guiding catheters and performed IVUS study successfully 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【20】This case illustrates the possibility that the anatomical features of coronary anomalies may promote atherosclerosis and cause angina pectoris, and that PCI may be used for the noninvasive revascularization of anomalous coronary arteries.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【22】Coronary artery anomalies can cause angina pectoris via both atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic effects.

Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is an aggressive Epstein–Barr virus-associated T cell lymphoma.

Our report emphasizes the complexity of the clinical manifestations of AITL, which aims to increase the alertness of physicians and improve the rate of early diagnosis.

Introduction\n\n【3】Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is an Epstein–Barr virus-associated neoplasm of CD4+ T follicular helper cells (TFH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Patients usually present with B syndrome, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and immune-related syndrome/signs. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and various autoimmune manifestations are distinct features of AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Histologically, the architecture of lymph node is partial or complete effacement with proliferation of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and high endothelial venules (HEVs). Small to medium-sized neoplastic lymphocytes are present in a polymorphous inflammatory background containing histiocytes, eosinophils, reactive lymphocytes, and immunoblasts. The immunoblasts consist of early stage plasma cell (PC), lymphocytes with plasmacytoid features, and large plasmacytoid cells with blast-like nucleusi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that the neoplastic T cells express most pan-T cell antigens (e.g. CD3, CD2, and CD5), and at least 2-3 TFH-associated antigens consist of CD4, ICOS, CXCL13, CD279/PD1, CD10, BCL6, and CCR5 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The absence of surface CD3 and the coexpression of CD4/CD10 represent the typical phenotypic aberrancy of AITL by flow cytometry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. Recurrent mutations in RHOA<sup>G17V</sup> (Ras homology family member A), TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2), DNMT3A (DNA methyl transferase 3 alpha), and IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, mitochondrial) are genetic features of AITL, followed by mutations of some T cell receptor- (TCR-) related genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. IDH2<sup>R172</sup> mutations are relatively specific to AITL with an incidence of 20–30%, especially co-occurring with chromosome (Chr5) gain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. IDH2 mutant cells in AITL may be sensitive to alkylating agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Cytogenetically, gain of Chr5, Chr3, and Chr21 is often observed in AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Reactive polyclonal plasmacytosis occurs in various situations, such as viral infection (EBV, parvovirus B19, and hepatitis), autoimmune diseases, and serum sickness. Excessive plasmacytosis in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) associated with hypergammaglobulinemia in AITL have been reported in the past few years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–21\\]</u>. Early diagnosis can be very challenging. Here, we present two male patients with excessive polyclonal PC proliferation in BM, PB, and ascites. Both of them had poor endings. The purpose of this article is to highlight the complexity of the clinical features of AITL to enable physicians recognize the disease at an early stage. Integrated diagnostic approaches such as histopathology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular biology are essential for accurate diagnosis and precise therapy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Clinical Cases\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 69-year-old man with a medical history of atrial fibrillation was admitted to our hospital due to fever for one month. Laboratory tests showed white blood cells (WBC) 14.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, hemoglobin (Hb) 113 g/L, platelet (PLT) count 85.6 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, and fibrinogen 0.96 g/L. Serum globulin increased to 72.9 g/L. Polyclonal high gamma globulin was observed in serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) (IgG 70.3 g/L, IgA 16.10 g/L, and IgM 3.32 g/L). Chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed generalized lymphadenopathy, significantly enlarged left and right atriums, pulmonary hypertension, and splenomegaly. The 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram monitor showed atrial fibrillation and ST-T changes. Atrial fibrillation was not treated regularly; diltiazem hydrochloride and enoxaparin sodium were suggested by a cardiovascular physician. Concerning the lower fibrinogen and PLT count of the patient, heparin was not given for anticoagulation.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) BM aspirates suggesting plasma cell proliferation (Wright’s stain) (×1000).

Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in BM showed polyclonal PC proliferation with a proportion of ∼45.9% . MFC and TCR/IgH receptor gene rearrangement tests were negative in BM and PB.\n\n【10】After BM and lymph node (LN) biopsies were obtained, the patient received symptomatic treatment and fever was controlled. Plasma exchange could temporarily decrease levels of globulin. One week later, he complained of drowsiness and inability to lift his upper limbs, and thereafter, he gradually developed lethargy and progressive decline in blood oxygen saturation. Cervical LN biopsy suggested angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that tumor cells express CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD43, and PD1, and they were negative for CD20, CD10, and BCL6. CD21, CD23, and CD35 showed irregular FDCs proliferation . Rare small lymphoid cells were positive for EBV (by EBER in situ hybridization). The results of this patient’s examination are shown in Figure 1. The diagnosis of AITL was established, and the patient received low-dose COP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 400 mg, vindesine sulfate 2 mg, and dexamethasone 15 mg). However, severe respiratory distress emerged on the third day of chemotherapy, and the patient eventually died of respiratory and circulatory failure.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【12】A 53-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of fever and cytopenia for 2 months. He went to a local hospital initially. Laboratory tests showed Hb 83 g/L, PLT count 53 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, and serum globulin 68.8 g/L. The T-SPOT test was positive. Ultrasound examination revealed right pleural effusion, abdominal effusion, and generalized lymphadenopathy. No acid-fast bacilli or malignant tumor cells were found in ascites. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of left cervical LN was negative. He received a diagnostic antituberculosis therapy, which suspended in the fifth day due to sudden high fever, and pleural effusion was increased. Thereafter, he went to the tuberculosis specialist hospital, and no acid-fast bacilli were found in the pleural and ascites effusion. Finally, two months later, after clinical symptoms appear, he was referred to our hospital. Laboratory tests showed WBC 6.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, Hb 53 g/L, and PLT count 42 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Serum globulin was more than 100 g/L. SPEP and IFE demonstrated polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (IgA 14.7 g/L, IgG 89.4 g/L, IgM 6.73 g/L, and IgG4 4.96 g/L) and Coomb’s test was positive. Human immunodeﬁciency virus, sera cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B serology, and hepatitis C serology were negative. Plasma EBV DNA was 1.19 × 10<sup>3</sup> copies/ml, and seven days later, it was quantified by qRT-PCR as 3.768 × 10<sup>6</sup> copies/2.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells, EBV-infected B cells. Symptomatic treatment of anti-infection, red blood cell transfusion, and plasma exchange was failed to prevent disease progression.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Bone marrow aspirate suggesting Rouleaux formation and plasma cell proliferation (Wrights stain) (×1000).

The results of this patient’s examination are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. A diagnosis of AITL was established, and the patient received a cycle of R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). Serum globulin was decreased to 84.8 g/L on the fourth day of chemotherapy. However, polyserous effusions and serum globulin levels had not been improved. The blood coagulation disorder is worse than before, and the performance of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) appears. Ultimately, the patient abandoned treatment and discharged.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Ancillary examination results of BM, ascites, and LN.</u>\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Clinical procedures of AITL are diverse and aggressive. BM, spleen, skin, and liver are the most common extranodal involvement sites. Effusion/edema/ascites occurs in 25–53% of patients and are usually nonneoplastic. BM involvement can be seen in 28–60% patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. MFC seems to be more sensitive to detect involvement than morphology in BM. The neoplastic T cells ranged 0.1–20% of total cells examined by MFC (median, 0.6%) in morphology-negative patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The reason may be that AITL often have a rich background of reactive cells, resulting in a low proportion of tumor cells. However, BM aspirate only counts 200 nucleated cells, which may cause a decrease in sensitivity. It is worth noting that flow cytometry still has diagnostic pitfalls in the diagnosis of T-NHL. On the one hand, due to the polymorphism of the phenotype of T lymphocytes, reactive T lymphocytes may have changes in the expression intensity of pan-T antigens. But the clonality of T cells cannot be identified like B lymphocytes using restricted expression of light chains. The detection of T cell receptor β\\-chain constant region 1 (TRBC 1) may be helpful, and its polyclonal expression can play a role in exclusion, but the monoclonal expression of TRBC1 does not confirm that it must be an abnormal clone. On the other hand, in the following situations, the tissue samples are contaminated by formaldehyde or apoptosis too fast, and the cells lose their viability; there are not enough channels to detect pan-T markers, such as four-color flow cytometry; there are not enough cells for analysis, such as fine-needle aspiration samples, or the proportion of abnormal cells is extremely low; or the abnormal T cells only had changes in expression intensity instead of loss of pan-T antigens expression; or the analysts does not have enough experience; all of these circumstances can lead to negative results. As to AITL, according to our preliminary experiences, apart from the above reasons, abnormal T lymphocytes do not express T cell receptor αβ in nearly ∼57% (51/90) cases. It is impossible to use TRBC1 to judge the monoclonality of suspicious T cells. In addition, AITL has a subtype of sCD3+CD4+CD7-phenotype, the pan-T markers only loss CD7, the expression intensity of CD3 is isointensity, or slightly diminished compared with normal T cells. There are a small amount of sCD3+CD4+CD7-cells in the normal bone marrow, and the proportion of this group of cells may increase under reactive conditions; this kind of AITL is prone to be missed. The addition of more markers of follicular helper T lymphocytes can be helpful to increase positive rate. At last, the bone marrow invasion of AITL is not 100%, so the negative detection in the bone marrow cannot rule out the diagnosis. In patients without BM involvement, trilineage cytopenias and polyclonal plasmacytosis can be observed as secondary features. In our report, patients presented with hypergammaglobulinemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and one patient had polyserous cavity effusions. BM and ascites examinations were performed prior to the diagnosis of AITL. BM aspirate revealed significantly Rouleaux formation with excessive plasmacytosis, mimicking plasma cell leukemia. Paradoxically, PC and immune globulin were both polyclonal. There was no evidence of BM involvement in both of them. Large B cells without surface and cytoplasm light chain expressed were observed in ascites of the second patients by MFC, resembling diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The negative of IgH receptor gene arrangement was nonsupport. With the experience obtained from the first patient, we suggested the probability of AITL of the second one, and rebiopsy was recommended.\n\n【18】LN biopsy is indispensable but not always available. Integrated diagnostic approaches including MFC and molecular genetics examinations are essential for accurate diagnosis. As to the second patient, histopathology suggested AITL by reexamination of LN, and neoplastic T cells detected by MFC and the clonal of TCR gene rearrangement verified the diagnosis. But the immunophenotyping of tumor cells by MFC in LN were CD2+, CD7−, sCD3+, CD4+, and CD10−, not the typical sCD3−/CD4+ or CD10+ immunophenotyping. It probably cannot distinguish AITL from other peripheral T cell lymphoma. But the usage of MFC can quickly exclude reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, T cell rich large B cell lymphoma, and plasma cell diseases, which are difficult to differentiate by pathology. The NGS test detected the recurrent mutations of TET2 and IDH2<sup>R172k</sup>, which further verified the diagnosis, and may be potential therapeutic targets.\n\n【19】AITL have a dismal prognosis with a five-year overall survival (OS) of 32–41% and a seven-year OS of 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. Older age (>60 years old), elevated WBC and IgA levels, thrombocytopenia, high international prognostic index and prognostic index for PTCL-U scores, and number of extranodal involvement sites >1 were adverse factors for OS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 25, 26\\]</u>. Patients with AITL with polyserous effusions seem to have poor endings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 28\\]</u>. Plasma cell hyperplasia seems to have no prognostic significance in AITL patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. We reviewed the clinical history, diagnosis, and treatment process to speculate the possible causes of poor endings. The first patient had a history of atrial fibrillation without regular treatment. Excessively elevated PC may lead to blood stickiness, which may increase the burden on the heart and further induce atrial fibrillation. The treatment to prevent thrombosis formation was unavailable because of lower fibrinogen and PLT count. The manifestations of unable to lift limbs, somnolence, and the sudden decline in blood oxygen saturation lead to the hypothesis of cerebral thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Cerebral infarction may be the direct cause of death. We speculate that the underlying cardiocerebrovascular diseases may make prognosis worse in patients with AITL and excessive plasma proliferation, consistent with Kelsey Sokol’s report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The second patient presented with severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and polyserous cavity effusion at onset, excessive polyclonal PC emerged in BM, PB, and ascites without neoplasm T cells infiltration. The T-SPOT test was positive; he was initially misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. The delayed diagnosis time superadded multiple adverse prognosis indicators that lead to poor conditions of the patient.\n\n【20】The relationship between excessive proliferation of PC and AITL has not been expounded comprehensively. TFH is helpful for differentiation of B cells to PC or memory B cells in lymphoid tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. In the AITL-NGO mouse model, AITL tumor cells were proved to act as TFH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. PC proliferation was accompanied by extensive secretion of IL-6, and the secretion of immune globulin can be completely stopped by adding anti-IL-6 and anti-CD126 (IL-6 receptor) monoclonal antibodies, which manifested that IL-6 is necessary for PC proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. The ultimate differentiation of EBV-infected B cells into PC was related to EBV replication, which is suppressed by a strong T cell immune response in EBV-seropositive healthy people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. EBV-positive B cells can be detected in 66–86% patients of AITL, on account of immunosuppression due to AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Tumor T cells, cytokines, and EBV infection may potentially cause polyclonal plasma cell expansion. In our second patient, EBV copies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was increased to millions, IL-6 levels elevated in sera, and these results were consistent with the past literatures. Whether PC component be a reflection of earlier disease or not should be further explored.\n\n【21】In conclusion, the clinical manifestations of AITL patients are diverse. AITL should be highly suspected in patients presenting with exuberant polyclonal PCs in extranodal sites, combined with syndromes of generalized lymphadenopathy, high EBV copies, and presence of autoimmune antibodies. Integrated diagnostic approaches are essential for accurate diagnosis and precise therapy. Cardiocerebrovascular diseases may be an adverse factor for patients with AITL and significant plasmacytosis, which need to be verified in the future by more samples. The efficacy of traditional treatment in patients with AITL and excessive PC proliferation is less-known and deserves more attention.\n\n【22】#### Abbreviations\n\n| AITL: | Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma |\n| --- | --- |\n| TFH: | T follicular helper |\n| BM: | Bone marrow |\n| PB: | Peripheral blood |\n| MFC: | Multiparameter flow cytometry |\n| EBV: | Epstein–Barr virus |\n| WBC: | White blood cells |\n| Hb: | Hemoglobin |\n| PLT: | Platelet |\n| CT: | Chest computerized tomography |\n| ECG: | Electrocardiogram |\n| FNA: | Fine-needle aspiration |\n| LN: | Lymph node. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:04:39", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:04:57", "cost": 17.84}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:04:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:04:39"}

It is important to recognise Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in electrocardiograms (ECG), as it may mimic ischaemic heart disease, ventricular hypertrophy, and bundle branch block. Recognising WPW syndrome allows for risk stratification, the identification of associated conditions, and the institution of appropriate management. Objective. The present case showed that electrophysiological study is indicated in patients with abnormal ECG and syncope. Case Report. A 40-year-old man with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome was presented to emergency with syncope. A baseline ECG was a complete right branch block and posterior left hemiblock. He was admitted to the cardiac care unit for pacemaker implantation. The atypical figure of complete right branch block and posterior left hemiblock was thought to be a “false positive” of conduction abnormality. But the long anterograde refractory period of the both accessory pathway and atrioventricular conduction may cause difficulty in diagnosing Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Conclusion. A Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome may mimic a conduction disease. No reliable algorithm exists for making an ECG diagnosis of a preexcitation syndrome with conduction disorders. This can lead to diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in the context of syncope.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a conduction disturbance in which atrial impulses are transmitted to the ventricle by an accessory pathway besides normal atrioventricular conduction. The result of these multiple fronts of depolarization is a short PR interval, the delta wave, and a widened QRS complex. The preexcitation syndrome (PS) is diagnosed by the surface ECG in sinus rhythm with a typical pattern associating a short PR interval (<0.12 s in adults) and a widening of QRS complex with a delta wave 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Patients with WPW syndrome may usually present palpitation, syncope, and sudden death. Pattern of PS is noted among 0.1 to 0.5% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The pattern is dependent not only on the location of accessory pathway (AP), but also on the properties of atrioventricular (AV) node and His-Purkinje system, and there is a wide spectrum of ECG types encountered. Spontaneous normalization of ECG with intermittent preexcitation is reported in 20% to 30% of WPW; dynamic QRS variations in WPW syndrome were noted several years ago 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】This case reported unexplicated syncope with unusual patterns of PS related to an atrioventricular accessory pathway (AP) was identified at electrophysiological study.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】This case is about a 40-year-old man who was presented to emergency with syncope that happened at work. He had no prior history of cardiac disease. The physical examination was normal. The ECG showed a regular sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, a complete right branch block, and posterior left hemiblock , and PR interval was 120 ms. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal echocardiographic findings with normal left ventricular systolic function.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Regular sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, a wide QRS and PR interval was 120 ms (b) post ablation we show a normal QRS. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】Electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed by intracardiac route in this patient with unexplained syncope and atypical ECG. We recorded a regular sinus rhythm, an AH interval was 150 ms, and HV interval was −24 ms. Programmed atrial stimulation was performed in the basal state and showed an effective atrial refractory period of right atrium at 200 ms and effective refractory period of accessory tract was 300 ms . The QRS had the same morphology during atrial pacing. We found a dissociation atrioventricular conduction in retrograde. We inserted a catheter of exploration in coronary sinus; we recorded a shorter AV at the distal electrode of decapolar that confirmed the diagnosis of a left accessory bypass . The use of isoproterenol (isuprel) showed a classic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with slurred initial QRS. This ECG showed fusion of antergrade conduction from both the left sided accessory pathway (AP) and AV node . AH interval with isuprel was 100 ms and HV interval was 42 ms. This was explicated by an accelerated atrioventricular conduction with isuprel in addition to accessory pathway . The effective refractory period of accessory pathway was 210 ms with isuprel . We supposed that atrial fibrillation caused ventricular fibrillation responsible for syncope. Thus, we had decided to ablate the accessory pathway .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | In atrial pacing, effective accessory pathway refractory period was 290 ms effective ((a) and (b)).

In Atrial pacing, an anterograde Wenckebach cycle length was 130/BAT (suprahisian AV block). The patient became asymptomatic.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Unapparent preexcitation syndrome was defined as a normal ECG at the time at electrophysiology which can be related to a masked preexcitation or an intermittent preexcitation. Masked preexcitation was defined as overt antegrade conduction over AP masked by the normal AV conduction. These patients have a minimal preexcitation on the ECG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【18】We reported a case of a patient with WPW and syncope. The preablation ECG showed fusion of antegrade conduction from both the left sided accessory pathway (AP) and AV node with predominance from left sided accessory pathway. Therefore, the ECG showed atypical presentation of preexcitation that is considered as rare in PS. This patient was studied because he complained of syncope. Similar findings could be expected in apparently asymptomatic subjects; systematic ECG in subjects at risk of arrhythmias as athletes is probably not sufficient to eliminate the presence of a masked electrical abnormality as a PS sometimes at risk of serious events. The most frequent unusual ECG of PS was the masked pattern of PS, associated with minor signs of preexcitation retrospectively visible when ECG became slightly different after AP ablation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although the ECG mimics RBBB, a more careful inspection of the baseline ECG indeed reveals a small delta wave and relatively short PR interval. A differential diagnosis of AP could be made after careful analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】It is important to recognize Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in electrocardiograms (ECG), as it may mimic ischaemic heart disease, ventricular hypertrophy, and bundle branch block. In addition, ECG can aid in the localization of the accessory pathway. Recognizing WPW syndrome allows for risk stratification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>, the identification of associated conditions, and the institution of appropriate management. More than 50% of APs are located at the left free wall, 5%–10% at the anteroseptum, 20%–30% at the posteroseptum, and 10%–20% at the right free wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In patients with an antegradely conducting AP, ventricular activation during sinus rhythm occurs simultaneously via both the AP and the atrioventricular (AV) node, resulting in a fusion complex. APs may be classified into several types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Manifest APs are those that conduct more rapidly in the antegrade direction than the AV node, resulting in a discernible delta wave on the surface ECG. Concealed APs conduct only in the retrograde direction, and no delta wave is documented in the ECG. Several algorithms have been developed to localize the site of APs from the surface ECG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In our case, the anterograde conduction in accessory tract and atrioventricular node both slowly explain this ECG figure. Charron et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> reported a particular electrocardiographic pattern in four members of the same family with conduction defects (RBBB and occasionally left anterior hemiblock), short PR interval, pseudoappearance of atrial hypertrophy, and occasionally sinus dysfunction or supraventricular extrasystole. This clinical entity is related to R302Q mutation of the γ2 subunit producing AMP protein kinase, coded by the gene PRKAG2, but, in our case, there was not a similar case in his family.\n\n【20】In conclusion, a Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome may mimic a conduction disease and this can lead to diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in the context of syncope.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:07:57", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:08:07", "cost": 10.241}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:08:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:07:56"}

Here we describe three cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes in pregnancy treated at our clinic between 2009 and 2012. Two patients came for specialist examination during pregnancy, the third after pregnancy. These women had no prior overt diabetes and shared certain characteristics, that is, no family diabetes history, age over 35, normal prepregnancy BMI, need for insulin therapy as of the early weeks of pregnancy, and high-titer anti-GAD antibody positivity. The patients had persistent diabetes after delivery, suggesting that they developed adult-onset type 1 diabetes during pregnancy. About 10% of GDM patients become pancreatic autoantibody positive and the risk of developing overt diabetes is higher when two or more autoantibodies are present (particularly GAD and ICA). GAD-Ab shows the highest sensitivity for type 1 diabetes prediction. We need to bear in mind that older patients might conceivably develop an adult-onset type 1 diabetes during or after pregnancy. So we suggest that women with GDM showing the described clinical features shall be preferably tested for autoimmunity. Pregnant patients at risk of type 1 diabetes should be identified to avoid the maternal and fetal complications and the acute onset of diabetes afterwards.\n\n【2】From 5% to 10% of diabetic patients have type 1 diabetes, which results from an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic cells. Autoantibodies directed against insulin, islet cells, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD), and tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 are markers of this immune destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Here we describe three cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes in pregnancy treated at our clinic between 2009 and 2012.\n\n【3】The first concerns a 42-year-old woman who was referred for specialist examination in her 16th week of gestation (g.w.) to confirm a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Her family history was negative for diabetes and her prepregnancy BMI was normal (22.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Based on her glycemic profiles, insulin therapy was begun in her 17th g.w. in addition to the already-prescribed dietary restrictions. During the pregnancy, the patient’s metabolic control was good (mean HbA1c 5.4%). The baby was delivered in the 39th g.w. (birth weight 3265 g). Postpartum OGTT revealed diabetes mellitus (2 h plasma glucose >200 mg/dL) with low blood insulin values (5–23.6 mU/mL), C-peptide 1.1 ng/mL, and anti-GAD Ab positivity (>2000 U/L), while HbA1c was 5.9%. In October 2010, the patient resumed insulin therapy and now has 4 injections a day, but her metabolic control remains poor (HbA1c 9.5%).\n\n【4】The second patient was 39 years old when she came for her first specialist examination. Her family history was negative for diabetes. Between 2004 and 2007 she had successfully completed two pregnancies, both complicated by gestational diabetes. Her prepregnancy BMI was normal (20.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). GDM had been diagnosed in the third trimester of the first pregnancy, but within the first two weeks of the second. Insulin therapy was needed in both pregnancies (right from the first few weeks in the second). Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed on postpartum OGTT after the second pregnancy. The patient took metformin therapy for several months, with no benefit. In April 2011, she was hospitalized and laboratory tests revealed: glycemia 170 mg/dL; HbA1c 7.3%, C-peptide 1.2 ng/mL; and anti-GAD Ab positivity (2000 U/L). She is currently on dietary restrictions alone.\n\n【5】The third patient was 36 years old and came for specialist examination in her 28th g.w. in February 2012. Her family history was negative for diabetes and her prepregnancy BMI was normal (22.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Given her poor glycemic profiles, insulin therapy was begun immediately in addition to dietary restrictions. In the 29th g.w. blood tests revealed anti-GAD Ab positivity (268 U/L) and low fasting plasma C-peptide levels (1.8 ng/mL). During the pregnancy, the patient’s metabolic control was good (mean HbA1c 6%). The baby was delivered in the 35th g.w. (birth weight 2520 g). The patient’s metabolic control is currently good (HbA1c 5.6%) and she is on dietary restrictions alone.\n\n【6】It is important to emphasize that these women had no prior overt diabetes and they did not meet the diagnostic criteria of diabetes (i.e. FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL or 2 h plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL during an OGTT, or HbA1c ≥6.5%, or random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL). Before they were referred to us for examination, all three patients had fasting plasma glucose levels below 126 mg/dL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【7】These pregnant women shared certain characteristics, that is, no family history of diabetes, age over 35 years, normal prepregnancy BMI, need for insulin therapy as of the early weeks of pregnancy, high-titer anti-GAD antibody positivity, and low fasting plasma C-peptide levels. The patients also had persistent diabetes after delivery, suggesting that they developed adult-onset type 1 diabetes during their pregnancy.\n\n【8】The literature on autoimmunity and pregnancy is limited. In most cases, GDM is characterized by a higher insulin resistance and lower insulin secretion, both of which are defects typical of type 2 diabetes. Women with GDM are consequently believed to be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. About 10% of GDM patients become pancreatic autoantibody positive, however, so—although type 1 diabetes generally develops in younger people (under 30 years old)—we need to bear in mind that older patients might conceivably develop an adult-onset type 1 diabetes during or after pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>.\n\n【9】In our personal experience, these are the first cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes occurring during pregnancy and our findings confirm the importance of identifying the risk of patients developing this type of diabetes.\n\n【10】Most studies have demonstrated that the presence of diabetes-related autoimmunity in patients with GDM predicts the occurrence of type 1 diabetes; the risk of developing overt diabetes is higher when two or more autoantibodies are present (particularly GAD and ICA). Füchtenbusch et al. have reported that two years after delivery the risk was 17% with one antibody, 31% with two antibodies, and 84% with three antibodies positivity. In the study of Nilsson et al. 83% of the patients with GDM and positivity for at least one autoantibody developed type 1 diabetes 4 years after delivery. Moreover, GAD-Ab shows the highest sensitivity for type 1 diabetes prediction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In addition, it has been found out that women with GDM and autoantibodies more frequently need insulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>; however, it has to be underlined that these patients are younger than those included in our case reports.\n\n【12】Up to now there are not guidelines about which patients should be checked for autoantibodies. According to our experience, we suggest that women with GDM showing clinical features as no family history of diabetes, normal pre-pregnancy BMI, need for insulin therapy in the early weeks of pregnancy, and age higher than 35 years, shall be preferably tested for autoimmunity.\n\n【13】Pregnant patients at risk of type 1 diabetes should be identified to avoid the maternal and fetal complications of this form of diabetes developing during the pregnancy and, very importantly, the acute onset of diabetes afterwards. Women found anti-GAD positive should be considered at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes and should consequently be regarded as potential future candidates for immunomodulatory strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:27", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:38", "cost": 10.821}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:26"}

The patient’s clinical course is retrospectively reviewed. A 34-year-old female affected by NF1 was referred to our institution for persistent low back pain and MRI diagnosis of pseudomeningocele located at L3 level with paravertebral extension. From the first surgical procedure by a posterior approach until the relapse of the pseudomeningocele documented by MRI, the patient underwent two subsequent posterior surgical procedures to repair the dural sac defect with fat graft and fibrin glue. One month after the third operation, the abdominal MRI showed a giant intra-abdominal pseudomeningocele causing compression of visceral structures. The patient was asymptomatic. The pseudomeningocele was treated with an anterior abdominal approach and the use of the acellular dermal matrix (ADM) sutured directly on the dural defect on the anterolateral wall of the spinal canal. After six months of follow-up the MRI showed no relapse of the pseudomeningocele. Our case highlights the possible use of ADM as an effective and safe alternative to the traditional fat graft to repair challenging and large dural defects.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pseudomeningoceles are extradural collections of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with no dural covering resulting from a dura-arachnoid defect or improper closure during spinal surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There are three groups of pseudomeningocele: congenital, traumatic, and iatrogenic. Majority of pseudomeningoceles occurs after lumbar spine surgery and resolves spontaneously. Usually pseudomeningoceles remain embedded in the posterior paraspinal soft tissue and cause no symptoms. The MRI is the radiological examination of choice for diagnosis and follow-up after treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Surgical exploration and repair should be reserved for symptomatic cases presenting with clinical features of intracranial hypotension, CSF leak, or infection. Besides pseudomeningocele is an extremely rare cause of spinal cord compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The association with congenital giant spinal pseudomenigocele and meurofibromatosis type 1 is rare and at the best of our knowledge there is no literature about this association. We describe a case of recurrent spontaneous lumbar giant pseudomeningocele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> in patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 and the surgical technique to repair the defect.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】This is the case of 34-year-old female with neurofibromatosis type 1 and scoliosis who underwent surgery for low back pain and MRI diagnosis of pseudomeningocele at L3 level with paravertebral extension . The neurological examination was negative. The patient was operated by L3 hemilaminectomy, reconstruction of the dural sac with water tight stitch, and L2–L5 stabilization with Hartshill rectangle and titanium wire  as reported in the treatment of thoracolumbar instability and deformities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. At the end of surgery, there was no intraoperative evidence of any residue. After one-year follow-up, the patient referred progressive pain and numbness in L5 left distribution and MRI disclosed a relapse of the operated pseudomeningocele at L3-L4 level . However, since a postoperative MRI was not available, the symptomatic recurrence might be also due to the increase of a hidden residual. A second operation was performed by removing the Hartshill rectangle with posterior reconstruction of the dural sac with fascia lata, fibrin glue, and tight water closure of the dura mater. A postoperative MRI was not available for this time point. After one year an MRI disclosed a pseudomeningocele relapse  and the patient underwent a third surgical procedure by L2–L4 hemilaminectomy and reconstruction by synthetic dura mater and autologous fat grafts with postoperative subarachnoid drainage for one week. After six months MRI showed a giant pseudomeningocele with intra-abdominal extension . At the end of each operation, there was no intraoperative evidence of any residual of the pseudomeningocele. However, since postoperative MRI images of the dural sac are not available until the fourth and last surgery, the multiple relapses might be also due to the progression of an unknown residual. The patient was asymptomatic without neurological deficit or abdominal symptoms. The operation was performed via anterior intra-abdominal exposure and reconstruction of the lateral wall of dural sac with a ADM sutured directly on the dural defect with reabsorptive stiches. After six months, the patient was fine without neurological deficit or abdominal symptoms and the spinal MRI showed no relapse of the pseudomeningocele .\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Preoperative MRI sagittal and axial T2-weighted postgadolinium images showed a pseudomeningocele at L3-L4 levels with paravertebral extension and psoas muscle remodeling (black arrow).</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Postoperative CT and X-rays (a and b) showing L3 hemilaminectomy and L2–L5 stabilization with Hartshill rectangle and titanium wire.

Discussion\n\n【12】Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic multisystemic disorder involving skin, central and peripheral nervous systems, bones, and cardiovascular and endocrine systems. This condition is caused by inherited or de novo mutations of the NF1 gene at the 17q11.2 chromosomal region, a gene that codes for the protein neurofibromin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It is a relatively common genetic disorder affecting about 1 in 3000 individuals. The features of the disorder are quite diverse and can include dermatologic, cognitive, and osseous diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Known focal osseous complications include long bone dysplasia with pseudarthrosis, sphenoid wing dysplasia, nonossifying fibromas of long bones, chest wall deformities (pectus excavatum), and focal, short-segmented scoliosis. The coexistence of hydrocephalus and NF1 is known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, but the presence of a spinal pseudomeningocele is very rare. The pathogenesis of the pseudomeningocele is a tear of the dural sac with a valve mechanism and the local alteration of the cerebrospinal fluid flow may cause the growth of the defect. When discovered, immediate surgical repair has been recommended especially for large pseudomeningoceles with the goal to prevent fistulous tract and infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Various treatment options like close observation for spontaneous resolution of small lesions, epidural blood patch, lumbar subarachnoid drainage and synthetic dural patch have been described in the literature for management of pseudomeningoceles with good results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. It is well known that the presence of dystrophic features in patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis increases the risk of relapse of pseudomeningocele after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The presence of a spinal scoliotic curve with imbalance and the remodeling of foramina and bony structures caused by CSF pulsation could be the possible reason of the multiple relapses of pseudomeningocele in our patient. For these reasons the traditional fat graft and the fibrin glue were not appropriate to repair the dural defect. Today tissue engineering is an emerging multidisciplinary field in which researchers are striving to replace or regenerate damaged or lost tissues. The principle common to tissue engineering is to produce new tissues by seeding cells onto a suitable three-dimensional scaffold in an appropriate growth environment. According to this principle, acellular dermal matrix can be regarded as a natural acellular scaffold to facilitate healing. In this patient the repair of the defect was possible only with an intra-abdominal approach and the use of an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) sutured directly on the dural defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Acellular dermal graft is processed from banked cadaver skin. The cellular elements are removed in the processing of the allograft but the native collagen and elastin matrix and the basement membrane complex (BMC) are preserved. It is also treated with agents that prevent any viral transmission when implanted. Because the tissue is acellular, it does not produce an antigenic inflammatory response after implantation. This tissue becomes vascularized like autologous tissue after implantation and is used especially in the reconstruction of contaminated abdominal wall defects. In our patient the integration of the implant with the dural sac allowed the reconstruction of the dural defect and the healing of the giant pseudomeningocele. In conclusion, in our particular case ADM was found to be a safe and effective alternative to traditional fat graft for a very big dural wall reconstruction, even in the setting of contaminated fields where also posterior fusion is now allowed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:08:12", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:08:21", "cost": 9.122}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:08:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:08:11"}

It involves the right ovarian vein in 70–80% of cases. The risk factors for the development of OVT are pregnancy or puerperium, hormone therapy with estrogen, recent surgery or hospitalization, malignancy, pelvic inflammatory diseases, thrombophilia and idiopathic OVT. We present a rare case of left OVT in a young, non-pregnant woman in her 30 s. A high degree of suspicion is necessitated in patients with the triad of young-middle-aged female, pain abdomen in lower quadrant and hematuria to diagnose OVT. Contrast enhanced computer tomography (CT-venography) is the diagnostic modality of choice. The patient was initially treated with low molecular weight heparin and then switched to direct oral anticoagulants. At 6-monthsfollow-up the patient was free from any symptoms.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】With 70–80% of the ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) involving the right ovarian vein (OV), thrombosis of the left OV is a yet rare thromboembolic condition with unknown incidence in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The postpartum (usually 2–6 days postpartum) or septic puerperal ovarian vein thrombosis has an incidence of 1 : 600–6000, in combination of caesarean births. In the case of a septic course, it can be life-threatening. Out of the multiple risk factors, thrombophilia is reported in up-to 24% of patients in various case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>. We portray a case of isolated left ovarian vein thrombosis presenting with abdominal pain in left lower quadrant (LQ).\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A young woman in her 30 s presented in the emergency room with abdominal pain in the left LQ for two weeks. The pain was shooting in character, with increasing intensity (7 of 10 on numeric pain scale) and radiation in the left flank. Clinical examination revealed mild tenderness and a palpable cord in the left LQ. A urine analysis showed isolated mild microscopic hematuria without any urological or gynecological disorders. A urine-HCG pregnancy test was negative. Blood examination was unremarkable apart from an increase of c-reactive protein to 1.69 mg/dl. After an inconclusive ultrasound and X-ray of the abdomen, a contrast (i.v.) abdominal CT was performed and revealed thrombosis of the left OV with dilated and tortuous adnexal veins . The thrombus extended centrally, but the confluence with the left renal vein was entirely patent. The patient had three complication-free pregnancies in the past and was on estrogen contraceptive pills. No other risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were reported. She was admitted for monitoring and analgesia. The patient was anticoagulated with Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily and i.v analgesia with 1 g 8-hourly metamizole was administered. Estrogen contraceptives (combination of 0.1 mg levonorgestrel and 0.02 mg ethinylestradiol) were withheld and she was advised to switch over to alternative methods of contraception, as no future pregnancies were planned. Further thrombophilia testing revealed APC resistance and heterozygote mutation of factor V mutation and factor II-20210A . A COVID-19 PCR test was negative. The patient was discharged well the next day, and anticoagulation was switched to apixaban 10 mg twice daily for one week, followed by dose reduction to 5 mg twice daily. At six months follow-up, she was free of any symptoms, and further venous CT was regarded superfluous. The patient was advised to continue the anticoagulation for another 4 weeks. A repeat urine analysis revealed no abnormalities.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT abdomen with contrast in venous phase showing thrombosis of the left ovarian vein and tortuous collateral veins.

On the contrary, Lenz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and Rottenstreich et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported thrombophilia in 14% and 24% patients, respectively.\n\n【10】The most common presenting symptom in patients with OVT is LQ abdominal pain usually on the affected side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Pain radiation to the flank, upper abdomen and or groin is not uncommon. A cord like structure in the LQ is palpable in <50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A high degree of suspicion is necessitated in patients with the triad of young-middle-aged female, pain in LQ, and hematuria to diagnose OVT. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen is the first line imaging modality and offers the advantages of being safe, easily available and helps rule out other abdominal pathologies. Contrast enhanced CT or CT venography offers sensitivity up to 100% and specificity up to 99% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Because of ionizing radiations and risk of contrast induced nephropathy, CECT is disadvantageous in pregnant patients and patients with renal insufficiency respectively. The typical findings in a CECT are filling defects in the ovarian vein with dilated or tortuous veins as seen in Figure 1. MR venography has the benefit of being free from ionizing radiations and safe in pregnant patients but involves higher costs and is unavailable in emergency setting. After excluding other causes of OVT, thrombophilia testing should be initiated.\n\n【11】The diagnosis of OVT in the above-mentioned patient was achieved by CECT and thrombophilia testing, revealed APC resistance and heterozygote mutation of factor V mutation and factor II-20210A. This patient had multiple risk factors such as smoking, estrogen pills, and thrombophilia. The authors recommend thrombophilia testing for further evaluation of patient with pain abdomen of unclear etiology and OVT.\n\n【12】The treatment of OVT not associated with pregnancy or sepsis is predominantly based on anticoagulation. Antibiotics play a role only in case of concomitant infection for, e.g. in puerperal sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Rottenstreich et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a significant inclination towards using antibiotics in pregnancy related OVT as compared to nonpregnancy-related OVT (60 vs 21.4% ). The use of anticoagulation is based on the principles of the usual management of venous thromboembolism and initiated with either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (therapeutic dose 1 mg/kg twice daily) or unfractionated heparin. The anticoagulation is subsequently bridged to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), which have been the standard oral anticoagulants for the past decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The recent introduction of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and their use in deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has led to their use in OVT as well. Cook et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> administered 15 mg twice daily rivaroxaban, followed by 20 mg once daily indefinitely in patients with OVT with thrombophilia (factor V mutation homozygosity) and on oral contraceptive pills. Naoum et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> treated pregnancy-associated OVT with tinzaparin for a week and then rivaroxaban 20 mg for 6 months.\n\n【13】The duration of anticoagulation in OVT remains controversial and should be based in the etiology and individual patient-associated factors. Rottenstreich et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a longer treatment duration in patients with nonpregnancy OVT as compared to pregnancy-associated OVT (6 vs 3 months, p = 0.1). Lenz et al. reported VTE reoccurrence rates of 6% at 1-year and 14.3% at 5-yearsfollow-up in OVT patients. Labropoulus et al. reported 17.4% recurrent CTE during a median follow-up of 2.3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Based on the above facts, the authors suggest treating thrombophilia-induced OVT with anticoagulation beginning with LMWH and continuing with oral anticoagulants for lifetime. The decision of lifelong anticoagulation should be based on the etiology of OVT and individual risk profile. The aforesaid patient was administered 1 mg/kg enoxaparin daily for 1 week and then switched to direct oral anticoagulant apixaban, which was prescribed for lifetime. The patients should be reevaluated regularly for, e.g. after 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Another therapy option of catheter directed thrombolysis carries high risk of bleeding and is rarely required and reserved for patients with heavy thrombus progression under anticoagulation therapy or if both kidney veins are involved.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【16】Even though a rare entity, a high degree of suspicion is necessitated in patients with the triad of young middle-aged female, pain in LQ, and hematuria to diagnose OVT. After ruling out the predisposing factors, testing for thrombophilia is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Anticoagulation should be commenced with low molecular weight heparin. Switching to DOAKs is possible.

Introduction\n\n【3】Endometriosis is defined as a chronic gynecologic disease which is characterized by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma in anatomical sites and organs outside the uterine cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Endometriotic deposits can be found almost anywhere; the commonly involved sites being the ovaries, the posterior broad ligament, the anterior cul-de-sac, the posterior cul-de-sac, and the uterosacral ligament in that order 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. It can occur less commonly in remote locations such as the intestine, thoracic cavity, and other organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is an estrogen-dependent disease that manifests as subfertility, chronic pelvic pain, fatigue, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, and dyschesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 5\\]</u>. The exact prevalence of endometriosis is difficult to determine because many women remain asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, endometriosis affects about 10% to 15% of women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. In symptomatic women, prevalence rate can be as high as 50% or more 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Various hypothesis has been put forward to explain endometriosis: Sampson’s theory, coelomic metastatic theory, müllerian remnant theory, lymphatic and vascular metastasis theory, and the stem cell theory among others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9\\]</u>. Sampson’s theory, one of the oldest theories on endometriosis, proposed that the retrograde flow of endometrial cells via the fallopian tubes into the pelvic cavity during menstruation was responsible for endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 10\\]</u>. Another theory, the coelomic metaplasia theory, postulates that metaplasia of specialized cells, present in the mesothelial lining of the peritoneum under the influence of cytokines and growth factors of the endometrial stroma, was the cause of endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Endometriosis is also thought to originate from müllerian remnant that fails to migrate or differentiate properly during fetal development (which is the müllerian remnant theory) or from circulating blood cells that differentiate into endometriotic deposits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>. The lymphatic and vascular metastasis theory proposes that endometrial tissue can through the lymphatics and blood vessels get transferred to remote areas like the brain or the pleura 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. Each of these theories cannot adequately explain the pathogenesis of endometriosis especially when found outside the abdomen and pelvis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It therefore follows that endometriosis is a complex disease involving the interactions of hormonal, genetic, immune, and environmental factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Summary\n\n【6】A 39-years-old married female presented via the emergency department of the hospital on account of recurrent right-sided chest pain of 22 years duration, recurrent cough of more than 20 years, and progressive breathlessness of a month duration. The chest pain started in her teenage years, sharp, pleuritic sometimes aching in nature with a score of 5–6 on a scale of 1–10 and not severe enough to negatively impact her day-to-day activities. It often starts a few days to the onset of her menses, lasts throughout menstrual flow only to abate after the stoppage of menstrual bleeding. Cough was unproductive, paroxysmal often worse with worsening chest pain. It disappears after the end of menstrual bleeds. No associated hemoptysis, weight loss, or drenching night sweats were found. No history of fever and no change in appetite or other gastrointestinal symptoms was found.\n\n【7】Breathlessness started a month before presentation, initially on mild to moderate exertion before progressing to occasional breathlessness at rest. It was first noticed while climbing a flight of stairs but now even while bathing or putting on her dress. No history of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and pedal swelling was determined.\n\n【8】Over the years, she had presented to several clinics where she had complained of crampy chest pain which usually started during her menstrual flow. She was, however, referred to the emergency department of this hospital by her GP when the breathlessness worsened. She has no known allergy and is not on any routine medication. Patient does not drink alcohol nor smokes cigarettes and had not had any exposure to second hand smoke. She is married in a monogamous setting with 2 children. She was diagnosed and treated for acid peptic disease 3 years prior to presentation. Her genotype gotten via haemoglobin electrophoresis is AA.\n\n【9】At presentation, she was in mild respiratory distress, anxious, not pale, afebrile to touch, mildly dehydrated, not cyanosed, no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy, and no pedal edema. Her respiratory rate was 38 cycles/min, oxygen saturation was 93% in room air with normal arterial blood gas result (pH = 7.38, PaO<sub>2</sub> = 88 mmHg, PaCO<sub>2</sub> = 42 mmHg, and HCO<sub>3</sub> = 24 mEq/L), trachea was central. Chest examination was suggestive of right middle and lower lobes consolidation with right-sided effusion. Cardiovascular examination was essentially normal. The abdomen was full, moved with respiration. No area of tenderness and no palpable organ enlargement were found.\n\n【10】Initial assessment was a right-sided pleural effusion secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis, to keep in view disseminated tuberculosis. Samples were taken for full blood count, electrolytes, urea and creatinine, hepatis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening, liver function test, plain chest radiograph, and chest computerized tomographic scan. She was commenced on intravenous paracetamol 300 mg prn, intravenous 5% dextrose saline 500 mls 6 hourly and oxygen via nasal prong to raise oxygen saturation above 96%. Chest radiograph (PA view) showed massive right-sided pleural effusion . Consult was then sent to cardiothoracic unit for closed thoracotomy tube drainage (CTTD).\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 A plain chest radiograph of the study subject in anterioposterior view showing massive right-sided pleural effusion.</u>\n\n【12】On the second day of admission, patient was seen by CTSU team and counseled on the need for closed tube thoracotomy. This was conducted, and the chest tube drained about 2600 mls of bloody fluid in the first 24 hours. The patient was provided with incentive spirometer, and sample of the pleural fluid was sent for GeneXpert, cytology, immunohistochemistry, lactate dehydrogenase assay (pleural fluid and serum), microscopy, culture, and sensitivity. The cardiothoracic team (CTSU) made a presumptive diagnosis of catamenial hemothorax because of positive history of cyclical right-sided chest pain during menstrual flow, and a review by the gynecologist was requested. The gynecologist reviewed and was in agreement with the CTSU. The post chest tube check X-ray showed significant re-expansion of the lung after 24 hours .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 A plain chest radiograph of the study subject in anterioposterior view showing a near total re-expansion of the lung after chest tube drainage.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Hematoxylin and eosin staining of pleural fluid sample showing the presence of typical endometrial glands.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Hematoxylin and eosin staining of pleural fluid sample showing the presence of endometrial stroma and epithelial cells forming glands.</u>\n\n【16】Other lab results were as follows:通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>Pleural fluid GeneXpert result: Mycobacteria tuberculosis was not detected in the pleural fluid.通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>Pleural fluid cytology revealed mainly amorphous eosinophilic material with few degenerating cells.通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>Pleural fluid m/c/s yielded no growth.通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>LDH(a)Serum-221 mg/dl(b)Pleural-229 mg/dl(c)Ratio-1.03通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>Total protein:(a)Pleural fluid-224 mg/dl (<300 mg/dl)(b)Serum protein-7.1 mg/dl通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>Human immunodeficiency virus screening was negative通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>Pleural fluid cytology report  demonstrated the presence of typical endometrial glands, epithelial forming glands, and endometrial stroma.\n\n【17】On the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of admission, the chest tube kept draining the serosanguinous fluid. The chest CT scan result showed a near-complete expansion of right lung (90–95%) with mild right-sided residual effusion. No obvious parenchymal lesion was seen . About 8 days after admission, chest drain had become inactive and patient commenced chest physiotherapy. A repeat chest X-ray showed residual right-sided pleural effusion which was mild. Chest tube was subsequently removed on the 10<sup>th</sup> day of admission following a 24-hour period of inactivity and patient was discharged on the 11<sup>th</sup> day of admission. She was given appointment to see the pulmonologist in the chest clinic 2 weeks after discharge. She came for follow-up as scheduled with no symptom and no clinical evidence of recollection of fluid in the pleural cavity. She was informed of possible need for segmentectomy or lobectomy with sample sent for histology if symptoms worsens or if onset of recurrent hemoptysis. She was subsequently referred to the gynecologist for follow-up.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Chest CT scan of the chest of the patient showing a near-complete expansion of right lung (90–95%) with mild right-sided residual effusion and no obvious parenchymal lesion seen.</u>\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】The diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis (TES) is a diagnosis of exclusion with atypical clinical history. However, the relationship of the onset and evolution of symptoms and menstrual cycle is a classic characteristic feature. The diagnosis of TES includes careful evaluation of the patient’s history, physical examination supported by laboratory tests such as chest radiograph and CT scan and more importantly the review of the cytology of pleural fluid sample. Biopsy has no major role in the diagnosis of TES but postoperative histopathological assessment can help strengthen diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Thoracic endometriosis (TES) is the most common endometriosis outside the abdominopelvic cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), also known as the immotile-cilia syndrome, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. Improper function of the cilia causes impaired mucociliary clearance. Neonatal respiratory distress, rhinosinusitis, recurrent chest infections, wet cough, and otitis media are respiratory presentations of this disease. It could also manifest as infertility in males as well as laterality defects in both sexes, such as situs abnormalities (Kartagener syndrome). During the past decade, numerous pathogenic variants in 40 genes have been identified as the causatives of primary ciliary dyskinesia. DNAH11 (dynein axonemal heavy chain 11) is a gene that is responsible for the production of cilia’s protein and encodes the outer dynein arm. Dynein heavy chains are motor proteins of the outer dynein arms and play an essential role in ciliary motility. Case Presentation. A 3-year-old boy, the offspring of consanguineous parents, was referred to the pediatric clinical immunology outpatient department with a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and periodic fever. Furthermore, on medical examination, situs inversus was recognized. His lab results revealed elevated levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP). Serum IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were normal, while IgE levels were elevated. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for the patient. WES demonstrated a novel homozygous nonsense variant in DNAH11 (c.5247G > A; p. Trp1749Ter). Conclusion. We reported a novel homozygous nonsense variant in DNAH11 in a 3-year-old boy with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the many coding genes involved in the process of ciliogenesis lead to PCD.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Axonemal structure dysfunction has been identified as being related to the emerging classes of disorders collectively known as “ciliopathies.” Examples include primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)/Kartagener syndrome, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, hydrocephalus, polycystic kidney disease, polycystic liver disease, nephronophthisis, Meckel–Gruber syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Alstrom syndrome, Jeune syndrome, laterality defects, etc. Primary ciliary dyskinesia, also known as the immotile-cilia syndrome, is a heterogeneous, mostly autosomal recessive genetic disorder and the first human disorder related to the motility dysfunction of cilia. Impaired mucociliary function due to defective axonemal structure leads to PCD recurrent respiratory manifestations (chronic bronchitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and pneumonia), male infertility, as well as laterality defects such as situs abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Autosomal dominant variants of PCD have also been reported in FOXJ1\\-linked ciliary dyskinesia due to de-novo mutations (OMIM 618699, 602291) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Over 300 genes have been identified to be involved in the function and morphology of the cilia, and at least 40 genes are involved in the inappropriate function of the cilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5) and dynein axonemal intermediate chain 1 (DNAI1) are the most disease-causing genes involved in the pathogenesis of PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. DNAH11 (dynein axonemal heavy chain 11) is a gene, which is responsible for the production of cilia’s protein and encodes the outer dynein arm. Dynein heavy chains are motor proteins of the outer dynein arms and play an essential role in ciliary motility. Patients with pathogenic variants in this gene present symptoms associated with PCD but have normal cilia ultrastructure. The clinical manifestations of DNAH11 pathogenic variants are usually similar to those of other variants causing PCD. The development of chronic middle ear infections and rhinosinusitis is the prominent feature of this disorder during childhood. In adulthood, the same symptoms persist; in addition, some radiological findings such as consolidations, atelectasis, and bronchiectasis might be discovered in high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of these patients. Moreover, bronchial colonization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa might be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Motile cilia can be found on the apical surfaces of the upper and lower respiratory tract, ependymal cells of CNS ventricles, oviducts (female reproductive system), and the flagellum of spermatozoa (male reproductive system) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Respiratory cilia consist of a central pair of singlet microtubules surrounded by nine microtubule pairs, which make a cross-sectional 9 + 2 arrangement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Proteins responsible for appropriate ciliary beating include inner and outer dynein arms that cause microtubules to slide through, generating ATP. The absence of the outer dynein arms, missed central pairs, and disarrangement of the microtubules are the ultrastructural defects causing PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Over the past 15 years, our understanding of effective clinical care for PCD has progressed remarkably. Although respiratory manifestations of PCD present early in life, no effective treatment is available to stop the disease progression. Available treatments for PCD are extrapolated from other diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【6】In this study, we describe a patient who was investigated for PCD through genetic testing that eventually resulted in the reporting of a novel mutation in DNAH11.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 3-year-old boy, the offspring of consanguineous parents (first cousin), was referred to the pediatric immunology outpatient department with a history of recurrent respiratory tract infection, growth retardation, periodic fever, persistent rhinorrhea, and wheezing. Also, his history revealed allergies to different foods. In his referral letter, mild bronchiectasis in CT scan was also noted.\n\n【9】He had a history of hospital admission about three months before the visit, with the chief complaints of fever and rhinorrhea. Furthermore, on medical examination, situs inversus was recognized (the heart was on the right, the liver was on the left, and the spleen was located on the right side of the body). His lab results revealed elevated levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell count (WBC) . The patient had normal levels of serum IgG, IgM, and IgA and elevated levels of serum IgE. A sweat test was done for possible cystic fibrosis (CF), and the sodium and chloride levels were 38 and 35, respectively (normal range: 5–35, borderline: 35–60, and for CF: 60–200). In addition, levels of antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus were in the normal range.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of patient’s lab results.</u>\n\n【11】In the patient’s follow-up, he had no other complications or complaints. However, the patient was overweight with an increased level of triglycerides and cholesterol. He is receiving metformin, diet therapy, and medications for allergies (montelukast and sprays).\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Genetic Testing\n\n【13】Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for the patient at the Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital NGS facility using Agilent V6 + UTR library preparation and an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing platform on DNAH11 (Transcript: NM\\001277115.2/Chromosome: 7p15.3-7p15.3). The bioinformatics analysis pipeline used Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA 0.7.15), genome analysis toolkit (GATK 3.6), variant effect predictor (VEP 89), and frequency filters with public and in house databases (e.g. ExAC, GnomAD, and GME). WES demonstrated a novel homozygous nonsense variant in DNAH11 (ENST00000409508: c.5247G > A) or p. Trp1749Ter (GRCh37.p13: 7:21698568 G->A stop).\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【15】We reported a novel homozygous nonsense variant in DNAH11 in a 3-year-old boy with primary ciliary dyskinesia born to a consanguineous family of Iranian descent. Our patient showed recurrent upper respiratory infections (URI), fever, and rhinorrhea, which were not responsive to typical medications prescribed for URI. Recurrent URI, born to a consanguineous parent, and situs inversus raised the susceptibility of genetic disorders such as primary immunodeficiencies. Due to the accessibility of genetic testing with an extended panel, we did not use any other tests to discover the pathology of the clinical manifestation. Furthermore, considering abnormal levels of serum immunoglobulins and blood cells, suspicion of genetic disorders was raised.\n\n【16】In the absence of prematurity and cystic fibrosis, a neonatal history of respiratory distress (pneumonia, cough, and tachycardia), rhinorrhea, otitis media, cough, and lateral defects should raise clinical suspicion of PCD, as it was manifested in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> .\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Clinical presentation of PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.</u>\n\n【18】PCD is a heterogeneous genetic disease that is caused by pathogenic variants in proteins essential for cilia assembly and function. In the majority of patients, the inheritance pattern of PCD transmission is autosomal recessive; however, X\\-linked inheritance patterns have also been revealed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Several genes have been identified to cause PCD. Dynein axonemal intermediate chain 1 (DNAI1), DNAI2, dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5), DNAH11, and thioredoxin domain containing 3 (TXNDC3) encode components of the outer dynein Arm (ODA)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Mutation of DNAH11, the first PCD gene identified in 1999, causes up to 14% of PCD cases. DNAI1 encodes intermediate dynein chain 1 of ODA. DNAH5, the second identified gene associated with PCD, explains more than 25% of PCD cases and encodes the major molecular motor of ODA, called heavy dynein chain 5 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Chromosome 14 open reading frame 104 gene (KTU) is responsible for cytoplasmic preassembly of axonemal dynein. Pathogenic variants in KTU have been reported to cause ciliary immotility and the absence of both dynein arms. Furthermore, pathogenic variants in the radial spoke head 9 homologue (RSPH9) and 4 homologues A (RSPH4A) genes lead to central microtubular pair abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Pathogenic variants in the retinitis pigmentosa guanosine triphosphatase regulator gene (RPGR), which play an important role in the maintenance of photoreceptors, are associated with X\\-linked recessive retinitis pigmentosa, dysfunction of sensory hearing, and PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Moreover, a single family has been described with pathogenic variants in the oral-facial-digital type 1 syndrome gene (OFD1) that are characterized by X\\-linked recessive mental retardation, macrocephaly, and PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Transient electron microscopy (TEM) was once considered the gold standard for recognizing patients with PCD. However, approximately 30% of PCD cases have normal ciliary beating patterns, such as DNAH11 and nexin-associated defects (e.g. CCDC65 and CCDC164), and thus would not be recognizable by TEM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, DNAH11 has a distinct phenotype characterized by a hyperkinetic beating pattern and decreased beating amplitude. Patients have recurrent respiratory infections due to impaired ciliary motility and bronchiectasis. Many genes have been shown to be related to the inversion of symmetry. The variant in DNAH11 is a likely explanation for situs inversus and recurrent infections in our patient. Pathogenic variants in the DNAH11 gene do not cause obvious ultrastructural defects identifiable by TEM. Therefore, DNAH11 could be overlooked if the diagnosis is established solely on TEM and further tests. Particularly, genetic testing is required to identify such pathogenic variants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 13\\]</u>. In our patient, genetic testing confirmed the final diagnosis, too. However, it should be considered that in approximately 35% of PCD patients, the genes are not discovered. Therefore, precise clinical evaluation and other differential diagnoses are of great importance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Until now, 39 genes have been identified as causing PCD, and any of the >200 genes involved in ciliary function could lead to PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, but so far, only 65% of PCD patients have been diagnosed with genetic testing. In conclusion, genetic testing should be considered as part of the diagnostic process as the most reliable test in patients with PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Gene sequencing for PCD is currently limited to the most prevalent alleles, including DNAH5, DNAI1, and DNAH11, in genetic panels; however, some companies provide whole exome or selective sequencing for PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【20】There are also some other criteria for PCD diagnosis. Levels of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) are low in PCD patients (<77 nl/min, normal range: 125 to 867 nl/min; mean, 287 nl/min); therefore, it can be a helpful test for PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Patients with CF also show low levels of nNO, so it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of PCD and should be ruled out in workups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Biopsies of respiratory epithelium could be used for ciliary motility evaluation to confirm PCD diagnosis; however, this approach is not sensitive enough to detect wide ranges of ciliary phenotype in this disease since the accuracy of high-speed video microscopy (HSVM) is limited and shows an overlap between PCD and normal patients in ciliary beat frequency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Taken together, no single gold standard test exists to diagnose PCD. To make an early and definite diagnosis, a combination of technical investigations, including nasal nitric oxide (nNO), high-speed video microscopy analysis (HVMA), and TEM, is required.\n\n【21】In both Europe and North America, children with PCD have been diagnosed recently with a median age of 5.5 and 5.0 years, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Taking a focused history and making an early diagnosis are beneficial for the early diagnosis of PCD. PCD is among the top differential diagnoses and must be ruled out in the following conditions: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> appropriate tests should exclude PCD in children with situs inversus totalis or any heterotaxic syndrome; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> children with cerebral ventriculomegaly should have a PCD diagnosis excluded; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> PCD should be excluded in babies with unexplained respiratory distress, especially when it is associated with other characteristics of PCD (respiratory manifestations are present in 65–87% of neonates, from mild transient tachypnoea to significant respiratory failure), if unexplained respiratory distress in term neonates is accompanied by atelectasis, the suspicion of PCD is raised; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> children with chronic productive cough, unknown bronchiectasis, and severe upper airway disease should be referred for diagnostic testing for PCD; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> males with immotile sperm should be considered for diagnostic testing for PCD; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> females with recurrent ectopic pregnancy should be considered for referral for diagnostic testing, especially if there are other associated symptoms of PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The association of infertility with PCD is because of the similarity between the structure of the sperm flagella and the ultrastructure of cilia. Infertility in women with PCD is due to dysfunction of the cilia in the fallopian tubes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Some medical disorders and phenotypes that may coexist with PCD include complex congenital heart disease, laterality defects, retinitis pigmentosa, hydrocephalus, pectus excavatum, and scoliosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Approximately 50% of PCD patients present situs anomalies that could be associated with congenital cardiac diseases, and in our patient, situs inversus was a clue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Schultz et al. reported two Finnish families with clinical picture of PCD, including chronic wet cough, otitis media, rhinosinusitis, and situs inversus. Diagnostic tests were done, and two likely pathogenic variants of the DNAH11 gene were identified (c.2341G > A, p. (Glu781Lys) and c.7645 + 5G > A) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Another study conducted by Xia et al. reported a Chinese family with heterotaxy and congenital heart disease (CHD). Exome sequencing and sanger sequencing in a nonconsanguineous Han Chinese family with heterotaxy and CHD and 200 unrelated healthy subjects (control group) identified compound heterozygous variants (c.3426\\1G > A and c.4306\\C > T) in the DNAH11 gene, resulting in CHD and heterotaxy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【22】To date, no clinical treatments have been proven to improve ciliary dysfunction in PCD. Regular clearance techniques should be performed for patients with PCD to prevent pulmonary infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Routine management of PCD pulmonary manifestations includes twice-yearly clinic visits, assessment of lung microbiology and pulmonary function like airway clearance, preventive measures such as pneumococcal and influenza vaccines, instructions for infection control, and antibiotic use to control infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 21\\]</u>. Moreover, exposure to inflammatory triggers such as tobacco smoke should be prevented. Physical activity is recommended in all cases to improve the strength of the respiratory muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【23】In this study, we reported a novel homozygous nonsense variant in DNAH11 in a 3-year-old boy with primary ciliary dyskinesia. This variation is a likely explanation for situs inversus and recurrent infection in the patient, who also shows recurrent respiratory tract infection due to impaired ciliary motility and bronchiectasis. This study expanded the spectrum of PCD syndrome pathogenic variants in Iran and highlighted the prominent role of genetic testing in the diagnosis of PCD-associated pathogenic variants, especially DNAH11. More studies should be performed to determine the most common causes of PCD syndrome in this country.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:56", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:13", "cost": 16.734}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:56"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare disease, classified as primary genetic primary cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. LVNC is caused by intrauterine failure of the myocardium to compact. LVNC is characterized by excessively prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular recesses of the left ventricle that communicate with the left ventricular cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The major clinical manifestations of LVNC include heart failure, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, thromboembolic event, and sudden deaths. Atrial arrhythmia usually seen is atrial fibrillation. Atrial tachycardia is rarely reported in literature with LVNC. We report a rare case of focal left atrial tachycardia treated with radiofrequency ablation in a patient with left ventricular noncompaction.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】An 18-year-old male with no past medical history presented to emergency department for evaluation of persistent tachycardia. Two days prior to admission, he had an episode of atypical pleuritic left sided chest discomfort that lasted less than 5 minutes and resolved spontaneously. The patient had no significant family history of heart disease and denied any alcohol or drug abuse. Patient was asymptomatic, and exam was benign except for persistent tachycardia in 140 s to 150 s.\n\n【6】On arrival a 12 lead rest electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a narrow QRS tachycardia with P wave of 139 beats per minute (bpm) and nonspecific T wave abnormalities . Patient’s pulse rate gradually decreased to 115, and ECG showed narrow complex tachycardia with obvious P waves . A detailed review of ECG revealed inverted P waves in lead II and AVL, while the P waves were upright in III and AVF , suggesting the possibility of ectopic atrial tachycardia, most likely originating from left side. Although his pulse rate was high, but all blood tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, thyroid stimulating hormone, D dimer and cardiac troponins, urine toxicology (only positive for cannabinoids), and chest X-ray were within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe systolic dysfunction (EF: 30%) and evidence of noncompaction of the left ventricle. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed extensive apical and mid cavity obliteration of the papillary muscles and large trabeculations and intertrabeculation recesses in the left ventricle  with severely depressed ejection fraction (28%). There was no evidence of right ventricle involvement. In several views the noncompacted to compacted ratio was 2.7 to 1, easily meeting the criteria for noncompaction cardiomyopathy . Left atrium was moderately dilated (49 mm) with normal right atrium (38 mm), top normal left ventricle (diastolic 54 mm, systolic 62 mm).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | 12 lead ECG on presentation.

Discussion\n\n【14】Cardiac rhythm disturbances occur frequently in LVNC. The electrocardiographic findings are usually abnormal, but no characteristic changes are defined. The abnormalities mostly reported are branch blocks, ST-T wave changes, AV blocks, left ventricle hypertrophy, and arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Ventricular arrhythmias are the most common rhythm disturbance seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The intertrabecular recesses appear to be a favorable substrate for ventricular arrhythmias. There are several case series and reports describing ventricular ectopic beats, ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillations, and sudden cardiac deaths in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Atrial arrhythmia usually seen is atrial fibrillation with reported incidence of 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> to 29% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The differentiation of narrow complex tachycardias (NCT) is a commonly encountered diagnostic dilemma. In this case the patient presented with an NCT, which initially appeared to be sinus tachycardia. Sinus tachycardia generally occurs in the setting of underlying physiologic stress or pharmacologic influence, namely, fever, infection, pain, hyperthyroidism, anxiety, stimulant drug use, or hypotension, among many others. Other causes of NCTs include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, sinus node reentrant tachycardia, unifocal atrial tachycardias, or multifocal atrial tachycardia.\n\n【16】Focal atrial tachycardias, by definition, originate from a single area of the atrium (unlike MAT), the location of which governs the appearance of the P wave. Our patient had focal atrial tachycardia arising from the left side because the P waves in lead II and AVL were inverted, while the P waves were upright in III and AVF. AT usually arises following atrial surgeries or diseased atrial tissue from underlying heart disease or enhanced automaticity, if there is no underlying heart disease. We believe that LVNC with atrial involvement was likely the cause of AT in our patient.\n\n【17】There were no reported cases of supraventricular tachycardia in a followup of 238 patients with LVNC for 4 years with periodic Holter monitoring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although less common, SVT has been reported in patients in the setting of LVNC. Wolff Parkinson White syndrome and associated supraventricular tachycardia are described mostly in the pediatric patients with LVNC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. Ventricular preexcitation is common in pediatric patients, and orthodromic reentrant tachycardia was reported in some of those patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. One patient with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and another case of atrial flutter with extreme atrial enlargement in the setting of LVNC have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. One case of regular sustained likely macroentry atrial tachycardia (AT) was identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However, focal atrial tachycardia is rarely described in the literature in this patient population. There is one published case of focal AT in a patient with LVNC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, which could well represent reentrant tachycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The patient described in this case had a focal atrial tachycardia arising from the ridge anterior to the left sided pulmonary veins, which was successfully treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation. The focal AT was probably related to the moderately enlarged left atrium. Our report suggests that although rare, involvement of left atrial myocardium is possibile in LVNC, and these patients may present with focal atrial tachycardia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:36:33", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:36:45", "cost": 12.666}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:36:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:36:32"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Angiomyofibroblastoma (AMFB) is a rare benign mesenchymal tumor usually occurring in the vulvovaginal area of middle-aged women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.

We report the first case of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva occurring in a young woman of 21 years old and involving the left labia minora.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 21-year-old woman came to our observation reporting the presence of a painless vulvar neoformation starting four years before, which had grown during the last months. She ignored the mass, despite its gradual enlargement during her disease course, and the complaint was of discomfort when seated and a localized burning sensation. Her personal history was noncontributory for previous surgery and laboratory data (emocrome, transaminase, sideremia, ferritin, creatinine, coagulation) showed no significant abnormalities. Clinical examination showed a pedunculated bilobulated neoformation of ten centimeters in diameter of tense elastic consistency, at the level of the left labia minora . On gynecological examination and vaginal ultrasound, the uterus and bilateral uterine adnexae showed no abnormalities. Inguinal lymph nodes were not swollen and tumor markers (cancer antigen (CA) 125, CA-19.9, CA-15.3, Alphafetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen) were negative. These markers were performed to exclude a concomitant malignancy in other locations. On ultrasound examination the mass revealed a well-demarcated soft tissue tumor with homogeneous echo and normal vascularity. In order to exclude a surgical disease, such as perineal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>, the patient was evaluated by surgeons that, according with personal history, clinical examination, and ultrasonography, excluded a lesion of their interest.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | The tumor shows a pedunculated large mass arising from the labia minora with a subtle stalk. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】The mass gave a clinical impression of vulvar fibroid, and a simple tumor excision was subsequently performed at the site of the stalk. During surgery, to exclude a malignancy lesion, a rapid intraoperative pathologic diagnosis of the tumor was performed, and it was reported as a benign soft lesion of the vulva. On gross examination, the lesion was well circumscribed, weighed 1230 gr, had a soft to firm consistency, and appeared homogeneously light gray to tan in color on the cut surface. No foci of hemorrhage nor necrosis was detected.\n\n【8】Microscopically, the mass consisted of fibroconnective tissue with abundant vessels of various wall thickness . No mitotic or atypical cells were seen, and the stroma was edematous. In immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were strongly positive for desmin and estrogen receptors  and negative for 𝛼 \\-smooth muscle actin, S-100 protein, cytokeratin, and CD34. All these features were in favour of the diagnosis of AMFB. Surgical margins of the lesion were clear, and the pedicle was not involved by the tumor.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | (a) Photomicrograph (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×2) showing pedunculated lesion covered with skin.

Discussion\n\n【13】This distinctive tumor was first delineated by Fletcher et al. in 1992 who described 10 cases involving the vulva 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> with only one case reporting a large pedunculated mass. There is a marked predilection for the female genital tract, predominantly the vulva, although rare cases have also been reported to arise in the scrotum and the inguinal area in males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 14\\]</u>. The female patients have an average age of 45.8 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. They usually complain of a painless mass that has been present from a few weeks to up to 13 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Clinically, these tumors are frequently thought to be a Bartholin gland cyst, although a preoperative differential diagnosis includes labial cysts, inguinal hernia, leiomyoma, and mesenchymal tumors such as lipoma and liposarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【14】On gross examination they are typically well circumscribed and ranged from 0.5 to 12 cm. They have a soft to rubbery consistency and a bulging, pink, and somewhat lobulated sectioned surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Microscopic examination confirms the well-demarcated nature of the lesion and shows alternating hypercellular and hypocellular edematous regions with abundant blood vessels. There is minimal nuclear atypicality, and mitotic figures are rare. The cells tend to cluster around blood vessels, sometime forming compact foci 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Adipocytes can be sparsely scattered within the neoplasm and in rare cases fat predominates; these tumors have been classified as the “lipomatous” variant of angiomyofibroblastoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The angiomyofibroblastoma can be distinguished from the aggressive angiomyxoma by its circumscribed borders, the presence of plump stromal cells that are occasionally overtly epithelioid, and perivascular condensation of the stromal cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. A single case of a malignant transformation of an AMFB in angiomyofibrosarcoma has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In that tumor, areas of typical AMFB merged imperceptibly with high-grade sarcoma resembling a myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma.\n\n【15】Immunohistochemical stains show uniform staining for vimentin and staining of a variable number of cells for desmin in most cases. The tumor cells also show variable expression for muscle actin and smooth muscle actin and are frequently positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors suggests that it might arise as a neoplastic proliferation of hormonally responsible mesenchymal cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Some tumors have also stained for CD34, although some authors question whether these CD34 positive tumors might present fibroepithelial polyps, which are frequently positive for this marker 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The tumor usually exists as a sharply circumscribed mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the vulva and usually does not form a pedunculated mass, which represents an exceptional event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. To our knowledge, only five cases of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva have been reported in the English literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7–10\\]</u>.\n\n【17】All cases are reported in Table 1. All patients underwent simple excision. The mean age of patients was 46.4 years with a range of 41–50 years. The lesion always involved the labia majora. The average size of the pedunculated AMFB was of 14.2 × 13.6 centimeters in diameter (range 4 to 23 cm). Except for one case, the presence of the lesion had existed for several years. The real problem is the preoperative clinical diagnosis, as the vulvar AMFB is a rare event revealed only by histological examination after surgery. All patients had an uneventful postoperative course, and the mean followup was of 20 months (ranging from 8 months to 3 years) with no recurrence.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Clinical features of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva.</u>\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 shows immunohistochemical staining for the most common antibodies in the AMFB. Almost all tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin and desmin, but uniformly negative for cytokeratin and S-100 protein. Not all tumor cells were negative for 𝛼 \\-smooth muscle actin and CD34. Staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors was observed in the nucleus of all tumor cells.</u>\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Immunohistochemical staining for the most common antibodies in the AMFB.</u>\n\n【21】Given the data reported in the literature on the pedunculated AMFB of the vulva, our case is the first concerning a young woman of 21 years old and involving the labia minora. The patient underwent simple excision with clear margin of the lesion and currently is in followup performing clinical examination every six months for two years with no recurrence.\n\n【22】This paper aims to emphasize that, after excluding the most common vulvar diseases, the appearance of a pedunculated AMFB should be part of differential diagnosis in the workup of any pedunculated vulvar mass even in young women with a lesion involving the labia minora. The treatment of choice is a surgical excision with clear margins, which is resolutive as demonstrated by reported cases in the literature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:57:29", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:57:57", "cost": 27.862}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:57:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:57:28"}

A complete blood count revealed anemia (hemoglobin, 9.3 g/dL), 578,000 platelets/uL, and normal total white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts. The patient was on anticoagulation therapy with 15 mg twice-daily rivaroxaban after being diagnosed twenty days prior with a bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) resulting in lung infarcts in the right middle and left lower lobes. These events followed a recent history of COVID-19 infection causing bilateral interstitial pneumonia complicated by sepsis, treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. This acute infectious history resulted in a 3-week delay of the patient’s neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel. Due to concerns for disease progression with further delay, he was referred for surgical management. The patient received a left-modified radical mastectomy with partial excision of the pectoralis major muscle and axillary lymphadenectomy.\n\n【6】Pathology after mastectomy revealed a 15 cm mass fungating through the skin, with papillary architecture and nuclear pleomorphism , and eleven out of twenty-eight lymph nodes were positive for malignant involvement. Additionally, at least twenty lymph nodes demonstrated subcapsular and intrasinusoidal refractile birefringent crystal-like structures. On staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), they were morphologically suggestive of infection with Aspergillus . There were no necrotizing granulomas in any lymph nodes; however, there were areas of foreign body giant cell reaction and extensive hemosiderin pigment deposition.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 H&E staining of (a) primary breast carcinoma under high magnification demonstrating papillary architecture and nuclear pleomorphism.

The results of all testing were unremarkable. He was febrile only in one temperature reading during his postsurgical stay, likely due to atelectasis, and the patient denied any other symptoms.\n\n【9】Further evaluation of lymph node blocks using GMS, PAS, and Gram stains was negative for microorganisms. Iron staining, however, demonstrated an abundance of deposition, including the septated hyphae-like structures identified on H&E . Initial findings on lymph nodes were thus attributed to pseudofungi. With true mycosis ruled out, antifungals were discontinued, and focus was switched to balancing the patient’s anticoagulation status. In the weeks that followed, the patient remained afebrile, and there were no other signs or symptoms of infection.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】We, hereby, describe a case of pseudofungi in an immunocompromised male with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy until a recent COVID-19 infection. Understanding diagnostic mimickers is an essential component of clinical practice, especially in patients with cancer whose immunocompromised state may contribute towards blunted or atypical disease presentations. Overtreatment not only contributes to waste in healthcare spending but also exposes patients to unnecessary risks of prolonged hospital stays and treatment toxicities.\n\n【12】There are few published case reports of pseudofungi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–5\\]</u>. Despite the morphological similarity between true mycosis and pseudofungi, a number of notable differences can be made on histology. True fungal infection usually presents with necrosis and granulomatous inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Such an inflammatory response was absent in this case, but thought to potentially be attributed to the patient’s immunocompromised status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Additionally, pseudofungi typically stain yellow-brown on H&E, while hyaline fungi such as Aspergillus are colorless and stain basophilic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The use of additional stains, as performed in this case, can help clarify the diagnostic picture. As pseudofungi commonly occur in settings of hemorrhage, during which iron and calcium salts may be deposited in tissue, they will stain positive for Perl’s iron stain, while being negative for stains that can typically confirm true mycoses, e.g. GMS or PAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【13】This case also exemplifies the oftentimes precarious balancing act of managing the anticoagulation status of cancer patients in this new COVID-19 era. Cancer itself lends to hypercoagulability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. When combined with this patient’s acute COVID-19 infection, which has also been associated with venous thromboembolic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, he developed PE. Anticoagulation therapy likely exacerbated bleeding from his fungating breast cancer wound, making it necessary to manage surgically sooner than anticipated. Pseudofungi in the setting of hemorrhage should be considered a potential confounding diagnosis to avoid unnecessary and lengthy treatment of fungal infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:29:46", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:30:00", "cost": 13.662}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:29:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:29:41"}

Gitelman’s syndrome (GS) is autosomal recessive renal tubular disorder characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, metabolic alkalosis, and hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism. It is usually associated with normal serum calcium. We report a patient presented with hypocalcemic tetany, and evaluation showed Gitelman’s syndrome with hypocalcemia. Case Report. A 28-year-old woman presented with cramps of the arms, legs, fatigue, and carpal spasms of one week duration. She has history of similar episodes on and off for the past two years. Her blood pressure was 98/66 mmHg. Chvostek’s sign and Trousseau’s sign were positive. Evaluation showed hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypocalciuria. Self-medication, diuretic use, laxative abuse, persistent vomiting, and diarrhoea were ruled out. Urinary prostaglandins and genetic testing could not be done because of nonavailability. To differentiate Gitelman syndrome from Bartter’s syndrome (BS), thiazide loading test was done. It showed blunted fractional chloride excretion. GS was confirmed and patient was treated with spironolactone along with magnesium, calcium, and potassium supplementation. Symptomatically, she improved and did not develop episodes of tetany again. Conclusion. In tetany patient along with serum calcium measurement, serum magnesium, serum potassium, and arterial blood gases should be measured. Even though hypocalcemia in Gitelman syndrome is rare, it still can occur.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Gitelman syndrome (GS) was first described by Gitelman et al. in 1966 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The prevalence of Gitelman syndrome is 25 per million population. GS is autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC12A3 gene present on the chromosome 16q13 encoding the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride contrasporter (TSC) at the distal tubule. It is characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, metabolic alkalosis, and hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism. In majority of patients of GS serum calcium is normal. We report a patient presented with hypocalcemic tetany, and evaluation showed Gitelman’s syndrome with hypocalcemia.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 28-year-old woman presented with complaints of cramps of the arms, legs, fatigue, and carpal spasms of one-week duration. She has been suffering with the similar complaints on and off for the past two years. Self-medication, diuretic use for prolonged periods, laxative abuse, persistent vomiting, and diarrhoea were ruled out. Patient did not have symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. No family history of similar symptoms is reported. No growth retardation and bone deformities are noted. Her blood pressure was 98/66 mm Hg with no postural hypotension. Clinically she was euvolemic. Chvostek’s sign and Trousseau’s sign were positive. Investigations are shown in Table 1. Arterial blood gases (ABG) showed hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis \\[pH 7.51 (7.35–7.45), 33.5 通用删除7(英):<u>(22–30)</u>, 42 通用删除7(英):<u>(32–45)</u>, and chloride 86 通用删除7(英):<u>(102–109)</u> mEq/L\\]. The following investigations were within normal limits: complete blood picture (CBP), fasting plasma glucose, serum creatinine, liver function test, thyroid profile, rheumatoid factor, and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA). Ultrasound imaging of kidneys was normal with no medullary nephrocalcinosis. Urine pH was 6.7 and specific gravity was 1.018.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Investigations.</u>\n\n【7】Urinary prostaglandins and molecular genetic studies were not performed owing to lack of facilities. The thiazide test (hydrochlorthiazide) was performed as described by Colussi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. After an overnight fast, the patient was kept recumbent for 4 hours and was given water (10 mL/kg body weight) to facilitate spontaneous voiding. After two 30 minutes basal clearances (mean of two values was taken), 50 mg of hydrochlorthiazide was administered orally, and six additional 30-minute clearances were performed. Serum chloride (Cl) and creatinine were measured at 1 hour and 4 hours. Urine was collected every 30 minutes by spontaneous voiding and analyzed for chloride and creatinine. After written consent, a healthy person was taken as control. The chloriuretic effect was higher than the natriuretic effect due to greater sodium (Na) than Cl reabsorption in tubular segments past the site of the diuretic action; hence, Cl data are usually preferred over Na in diuretic based clearances. The diuretic effect was measured by choosing maximal increase of urine electrolyte excretion over mean basal levels (i.e. maximal excretion at any time minus the mean of the two basal clearances) as the test result. Fractional excretion of chloride is as follows: Results of this test were shown in Table 2.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Hypocalcemia was treated initially with 10 mL of 10% wt/vol (1 gram of calcium gluconate equivalent to 90 mg of elemental calcium) calcium gluconate diluted in 50 mL of 5% dextrose is given intravenously over a period of 10 minutes. It was followed by slow infusion at a rate of 50 mg of elemental calcium per hour (1 mg elemental calcium/kg/hour). Oral calcium supplementation was started at a dose of 1500 mg of elemental calcium daily. Hypomagnesemia was treated with intravenous magnesium sulphate administered at a rate of 64 mEq over the first 24 hours and then 32 mEq daily for the next 2 days followed by oral magnesium salts. Hypokalemia was treated with oral potassium chloride solution 40 to 100 meq/L per day, divided into three doses. Doses of intravenous and oral supplementations of calcium, potassium, and magnesium were adjusted according symptoms and serum levels electrolytes. Spironolactone 200 mg in two divided doses was also added. The patient’s symptoms had improved partially. Serum potassium and magnesium levels were corrected to 3.2 mEq/L and 1.7 mEq/L, respectively. Serum calcium was corrected to 8.6 mg/dL. She did not develop further episodes of tetany.</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】When patient presented with features suggestive of tetany, the initial investigations showed hypocalcemia. Despite treatment with intravenous and oral calcium, the tetany did not subside. Further evaluation showed hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. These investigations suggested the possibility of two causes either Bartter’s syndrome (BS) or Gitelman syndrome. Hypomagnesemia cannot differentiate between BS from GS because 20–30% of BS patients can have mild hypomagnesaemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Hypomagnesemia in Bartter’s syndrome is due to loss of thick ascending loop of henle (TAL) transepithelial potential difference that drives paracellular divalent cation reabsorption. In GS hypomagnesaemia is severe and seen in 100% patients. Muscle cramps and chondrocalcinosis are commonly seen in GS and not seen in BS. Hypocalciuria (calcium and creatinine ratio less than 0.2) in this patient suggested the GS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. As molecular genetic tests were not available, thiazide loading test was done. The test showed blunted chloriuretic response with thiazide diuretic in this patient when compared with the control (Δ 1.8 in patient and 3.7 in control). When compared with historic control also, the diuretic response is blunted (Δ 1.8 in this patient, 2.3  in historic control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>).\n\n【11】The cause of hypocalcemia, in spite of hypocalciuria in GS, is due to hypomagnesaemia induced (a) impaired synthesis, secretion of PTH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> (b) end organ resistance to PTH and vitamin D 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Usually in GS serum calcium levels are normal and tetany is because of hypomagnesemia. But this patient has GS with both hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia.\n\n【12】Our patient data was compared with the other reported cases in the literature .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 GS with hypocalcemia.</u>\n\n【14】Another differential diagnosis for hypomagnesemia with hypocalcemia includes hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH). It manifests in the newborn period and is characterized by very low serum magnesium and low calcium concentrations with normal serum potassium levels.\n\n【15】#### 4\\.

When these laboratory abnormalities develop rapidly, clinical complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, acute renal failure, seizures, or death may occur. TLS is caused by rapid release of intracellular contents by dying tumor cells, a condition that is expected to be common in hematologic malignancies. However, TLS rarely occurs with solid tumors, and here we present the second chemotherapy-induced TLS in a patient with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma to be reported in the literature. We also provide information regarding the total cases of TLS in solid tumors reported from 1977 to present day. Our methodology involved identifying key articles from existing reviews of the literature and then using search terms from these citations in MEDLINE to find additional publications. We relied on a literature review published in 2003 by Baeksgaard et al. where they gathered all total 45 cases reported from 1977 to 2003. Then, we looked for new reported cases from 2004 to present day. All reports (case reports, brief reports, letters to editor, correspondence, reviews, journals, and short communications) identified through these searches were reviewed and included.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Tumor lysis syndrome is a life-threatening oncologic emergency that occurs when a large amount of malignant tumor cells breakdown rapidly and release their intracellular contents into the systemic circulation causing electrolyte and metabolic disturbances, such as hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Renal insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and death due to multiorgan failure may be the final consequences of these biochemical derangements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Tumor lysis syndrome develops usually after the initiation of chemotherapy but in rare cases may arise spontaneously before any antitumor therapy has been initiated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–19\\]</u>  .

Also, a review of the literature regarding TLS in solid tumors is presented and recommendations for management are discussed.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【10】The patient is a 57-year-old Hispanic man with a history of stage III moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma intestinal type, diagnosed in late 2006. He was enrolled in a clinical trial for a new regimen of neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m² i.v. over 2 hours on days 1 and 15), docetaxel (25 mg/m² i.v. over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15), floxuridine (110 mg/kg i.v. over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 15), and leucovorin calcium (500 mg/m² i.v. over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 15) with treatment repeated every 4 weeks. After the second course (January 2007), he underwent resective therapy (partial gastrectomy) followed by 2 more cycles of the above-mentioned chemotherapy regimen as an adjuvant therapy.\n\n【11】Five months later, recurrence of the primary tumor was found in the liver; therefore, the patient was started on a different regimen (paclitaxel 120 mg/m², floxuridine 150 mg/kg, leucovorin 500 mg/m², and cisplatin 100 mg/m²), and liver segmentectomy was performed.\n\n【12】Unfortunately, patient failed regular controls, and by 2011 a CT of the chest and abdomen revealed extensive metastatic liver nodules which ranged from 3.5 cm to sub-centimeter in size, and metastasis to the sternum were also found. Consequently, he was again included in the initial experimental chemotherapy regimen as a first line therapy for his metastatic disease (oxaliplatin, docetaxel, floxuridine, and leucovorin).\n\n【13】Seven days after receiving the first chemotherapy cycle, he developed nausea, vomiting, oliguria, generalized weakness, and was referred to the emergency department by his oncologist due to abnormal laboratory data .\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Laboratory values before and after chemotherapy.</u>\n\n【15】On arrival the patient was alert and appeared in poor general condition, pale, volume depleted with low blood pressure (102/63 mmHg), tachycardia (102/min), respiratory rate of 20/min, and body temperature of 36.6°C. A firm, nontender, 2 cm below the costal margin of the right midclavicular line hepatomegaly was appreciated. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy, and laboratory findings are shown on Table 2.\n\n【16】Urinalysis determined urine pH of 5.0 (4.5–7.5). The chest radiograph appeared to be normal. An EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, left anterior fascicular block, and peaked T waves . A renal ultrasound examination revealed an increased bilateral cortical echogenicity but no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | EKG from the patient’s admission showing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and peaked T waves. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【18】A diagnosis of chemotherapy-induced TLS with acute renal failure was made. The patient was given vigorous volume expansion, intravenous sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, insulin given together with 50% dextrose, and allopurinol. His laboratory data did not improve and hemodialysis was started. The patient underwent a total of 6 hemodialysis over a course of two weeks and was discharged 18 days after with normal serum electrolyte and metabolic parameters. However, his renal function continued to be impaired with a serum creatinine of 3.86 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 23 mg/dL, and eGFR of 16.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Review of the Literature\n\n【20】TLS is an oncologic emergency characterized by severe electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities due to a rapid and massive lysis of malignant cells with the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream, overwhelming the excretory and reutilization capacities of the body, leading to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and secondary hypocalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>. As a consequence, these biochemical disorders can become clinically relevant and present as renal insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and death due to multiorgan failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>. Cairo and Bishop published the most complete and often referenced definition of TLS in 2004. They classified TLS into two groups, separating patients exhibiting only laboratory findings of TLS from those with potentially life-threatening clinical presentations. Cairo and Bishop definitions of laboratory and clinical TLS are summarized in Table 3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4, 6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 Classification of tumor lysis syndrome by Cairo and Bishop.</u>\n\n【22】In the setting of a malignancy with a high proliferation rate, large tumor burden, and/or high sensitivity to treatment, initiation of anticancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, resective surgical procedures, immunotherapy, hormonotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, or sometimes glucocorticoid therapy alone may result in the rapid lysis of tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5–8\\]</u>  . In addition, TLS can occur spontaneously from the tumor necrosis prior the onset of anticancer therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–19\\]</u>  .\n\n【23】Tumor and host-related factors associated with an increased risk of TLS in solid tumors are mentioned in Table 4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>. The tumor-related risk factors are common characteristics of hematological malignancies, where TLS is a well-known clinical problem, especially in acute lymphoblastic leukemias and high-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, and particularly in Burkitt’s lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. However, TLS can rarely occur in solid tumors that have a high proliferative rate, large tumor burden, and high sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 4 Risk factors for tumor lysis syndrome is solid tumors.</u>\n\n【25】According to the literature review, there have been 100 reported cases of TLS in patients with solid tumors from the first report in 1977 to 2011  , including small cell carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 20–30\\]</u>, squamous cell carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>, adenocarcinomas of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 31–33\\]</u>, mixed small cell and nonsmall cell lung carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>, gastrointestinal carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15, 35–42\\]</u>, hepatoblastomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43, 44\\]</u>, hepatocellular carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 45–53\\]</u>, renal carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54–56\\]</u>, transitional cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>, prostate carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58–61\\]</u>, breast carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 30, 62–68\\]</u>, ovarian carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[69, 70\\]</u>, endometrial carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[71\\]</u>, vulva carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72, 73\\]</u>, thymomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[74, 75\\]</u>, melanomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[76–82\\]</u>, gestational trophoblastic neoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[83\\]</u>, germ cell tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18, 64, 84, 85\\]</u>, neuroblastomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[86, 87\\]</u>, medulloblastomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[88, 89\\]</u>, and sarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 90–93\\]</u>. Most cases regarded as TLS in solid tumors were chemotherapy-induced, even though various other causes were pointed out for TLS in solid tumors as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>  . The dominant factor for developing TLS in solid tumors, which occurred in all 100 cases, was having a large tumor burden. Another relevant fact was the presence of metastatic disease observed in 83% of all cases, of which the liver was the most affected organ; thus, the remaining 17% presented with bulky primary tumor.\n\n【26】Other risk factors for developing TLS in solid tumors included pretreatment increased LDH, renal impairment, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia found in 86% (43/50), 26% (18/69), 42% (21/50), and 14% (6/44) of the evaluable patients in which specific results were reported, respectively.\n\n【27】In 7% of the cases, we found hydronephrosis as a high risk for developing TLS due to compression of the genitourinary tract by the tumor, being particular hazard neoplasms such as germ cell tumor, prostate cancer, retroperitoneal sarcoma, and uterus carcinoma.\n\n【28】Irrespective of the cancer type, there is a 20–50% increase in mortality for undiagnosed or late-diagnosed TLS cases in solid tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This high mortality rate may be due to the fact that in solid tumors, contrary to what is observed in hematological malignancies, TLS is usually evident after a few days within treatment when the patient may have already left the hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 8\\]</u>. Another cause is that in hematological malignancies, prophylactic measures are more often implemented, and awareness of the syndrome is higher. The fatality rate of the 100 cases presenting TLS in solid tumors was found to be 41%.\n\n【29】Symptoms associated with TLS strongly reveal electrolyte and metabolic irregularities, which are hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, secondary hypocalcemia, and hyperuricemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>. Hyperkalemia, which takes place within 12 to 24 hours from the antineoplastic treatment’s initiation, becomes the earliest and most severe laboratory finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The clinical manifestations for hyperkalemia include lethargy, weakness, paresthesias, muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, and abnormalities in the electrocardiogram, such as peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complexes, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or asystole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>. Since the phosphorus concentration is higher in malignant cells than in normal cells (4 : 1), accelerated tumor breakdown usually leads to hyperphosphatemia with the subsequent secondary hypocalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–7\\]</u>. Both electrolyte disturbances, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia, may cause a variety of symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, lethargy, muscle cramps, tetany, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and/or acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–6\\]</u>. Accumulation of uric acid may increase the urinary uric acid concentration to a point where precipitation occurs, and acute renal failure may be the consequence. The widespread use of agents lowering uric acid production or excretion is responsible for nephrocalcinosis, becoming a major mechanism of acute renal failure in TLS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3, 6\\]</u>. However, calcium phosphate precipitation does not only occur in the kidneys, but also in other soft tissues such as the heart, where it may induce cardiac arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【30】The fact that urine is acidic facilitates uric acid to precipitate, thus excessive overproduction and over excretion could accumulate uric acid in the form of crystal precipitation in the renal tubules, leading to obstructive uropathy with acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 65\\]</u>. Uric acid or calcium phosphate accumulation does not always imply urinary tract symptoms; however, flank pain due to renal pelvic or ureteral stone formation may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. The urinalysis quite often discloses a number of uric acid crystals, amorphous urates, calcium phosphate crystals, and/or hematuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【31】The treatment principles for TLS are prevention, early diagnosis, and proper management of disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In 2008, an international expert panel published evidence-based guidelines, for the prevention and treatment of TLS depending on the malignancy risk category. According to this evidence-based guidelines unless tumor and/or host-related risk factors are associated, solid tumors are considered low risk (<1%) for developing TLS. Thus, adequate recommendations for the prevention and management of TLS in solid tumors are accurate hydration prior to therapy and a “watch and wait” approach with close monitoring on looking for the first biologic derangements characterizing TLS (hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, increased creatinine level) without any form of prophylactic hypouricemic therapy or phosphate binders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3, 6, 37\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Once TLS is established, the standard therapy strategy for treating TLS is based on volume expansion, decreasing the metabolic abnormalities, and in most cases providing supportive treatment of renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Administration of fluids is important because it increases renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, and reduces the urinary supersaturation of uric acid, calcium, and phosphate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 5, 7\\]</u>. Patients should receive 3 l/m²/day (200 mL/Kg/day if ≤10 kg) and have a urine output ≥100 mL/m²/h (3 mL/kg/h if ≤10 kg) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4, 6\\]</u>. In the absence of obstructive uropathy and/or hypovolemia, diuretics may be used to maintain the adequate urine output 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4, 6, 7\\]</u>. The utility of low-dose dopamine to enhance renal blood flow is not as clear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Maintaining urine pH above 7 with the aid of acetazolamide and/or sodium bicarbonate for the prevention and/or treatment of TLS may reduce the precipitation of uric acid crystals but at the same time may decrease the solubility of calcium phosphate or xanthine, and in the setting of acute renal failure, metabolic alkalosis may be an unintended consequence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 4, 6, 7\\]</u>. Consequently, the use of sodium bicarbonate should be restricted to those patients with severe metabolic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Hyperkalemia may be an acute life-threatening emergency in patients with TLS. In case of hyperkalemia, cardiac membrane stabilization with 10% calcium gluconate may not be effective in the setting of severe hyperphosphatemia, and given an increased risk of calcium phosphate tissue precipitation, calcium administration is only appropriate for symptomatic hypocalcemia (arrhythmia, hypotension, tetany, or muscle cramps) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. Consequently, measures to reduce serum potassium or enhance potassium excretion should have priority. These include primarily insulin and beta-2 agonists to shift potassium into cells and volume expansion and loop diuretics to enhance potassium elimination. Sodium bicarbonate may be used as a slow continuous infusion in the face of severe acidosis. Exchange resins may be administered but should not be relied upon in the setting of acute hyperkalemia due to their unpredictable efficacy. For patients with renal failure, dialysis should be initiated as soon as possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. For hyperphosphatemia, phosphate binders and/or hypertonic dextrose with insulin may be used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Allopurinol is a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase , and it has been successfully prescribed for the treatment of hyperuricemia. Allopurinol is metabolized to oxypurinol, which in turn inhibits xanthine oxidase; therefore, it blocks the metabolic process of xanthine and hypoxanthine to uric acid, leading to an increase in the levels of these two metabolites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–6\\]</u>. As a result, patients with massive TLS who have been prescribed allopurinol may develop xanthine precipitation leading to acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 65\\]</u>. This can be avoided by replacing allopurinol with urate oxidase, which catabolizes uric acid to the more soluble compound allantoin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–6\\]</u> . Urate oxidase is an enzyme that can be found in many mammals except humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 4, 6\\]</u>. The two available commercial forms of urate oxidase are a nonrecombinant form (uricozyme) and a recombinant form (rasburicase), which is the preferred one. Rasburicase has been shown to be more effective than allopurinol, since it has higher uricolytic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–7\\]</u>, it does not increase xanthine levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 4, 5, 7\\]</u>, and it reduces high uric acid levels prior treatment initiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Mechanism of action of hypouricemic agents. Hyperuricemia is a consequence of the catabolism of purine nucleic acids to hypoxanthine and xanthine and then to uric acid via the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxydase. Rasburicase (exogenous urate oxidase) leads uric acid to a more soluble compound, allantoin. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【38】In some patients, despite prophylactic and therapeutic measures, acute renal failure ensues, and its management includes careful monitoring of fluid intake and output, electrolyte balance, hypertension control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, and renal dialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[94\\]</u>. Indications for renal replacement therapy include volume overload with pulmonary edema or hypertension that is refractory to therapy, low urine output (oliguria), persistent or symptomatic hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and/or hyperuricemia despite conservative measures, metabolic acidosis with pH less than 7.2 or bicarbonate less than 10 mEq/l, rapidly rising blood urea nitrogen greater than 150 mg/dL, and neurologic symptoms secondary to uremia or electrolyte imbalance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 95\\]</u>. From the above-mentioned criteria, oliguria and other biochemical disturbances related to TLS have become more frequent indications for dialysis than hyperuricemia since the introduction of rasburicase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 94\\]</u>. Both hemodialysis and hemofiltration are affective, while peritoneal dialysis is not 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[94, 96\\]</u>. Dialysis should be continued until proper renal function is reestablished.\n\n【39】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【40】Our patient with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma developed metabolic (hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia) and clinical (cardiac arrhythmia and acute renal failure) derangements 7 days after instituting chemotherapy, meeting CTLS diagnostic criteria. According to previous reports, there are 2 patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinomas who developed TLS documented in the literature 通用删除7(英):<u>(34, 35)</u>, although only one occurred after chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u> . Therefore, our case would be the second gastric adenocarcinoma chemotherapy-induced TLS but the first to be reported after the use of the experimental chemotherapeutic regimen consisting on oxaliplatin, leucovorin, floxuridine, and docetaxel.\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 5 Similarities and differences between chemotherapy-induced TLS in advanced gastric adenocarcinoma reported in 2008 and our case.</u>\n\n【42】Chemotherapy-related nephrotoxicity was less likely due to the fact that the anticancer agents the patient was receiving are not considered to be nephrotoxic, except for oxaliplatin and docetaxel which have less than a 1% probability of causing renal failure, and it usually occurs with high doses and after repeated exposures.\n\n【43】Large tumor burden, multiple metastases to liver and bone, the use of combination chemotherapy drugs, pretreatment elevated LDH, and dehydration were the risk factors that placed the patient in a high-risk group for developing TLS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>, although his renal function and uric acid levels were normal before getting anticancer treatment.\n\n【44】The purpose for giving sodium bicarbonate to the patient was to correct the metabolic acidosis, rather than alkalinizing urine. Despite intensive medical treatment, the patient developed refractory electrolyte imbalances, metabolic acidosis, uremia, and oliguria. Thus, hemodialysis was performed with an improvement of the mentioned abnormalities, and the TLS was resolved. However, his renal function never returned to baseline, which has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality.\n\n【45】Even though solid tumors with high sensitivty to therapy are considered to be at high risk for developing TLS, we noticed that the syndrome was also present in tumor types considered as relatively insensitive to therapy such as melanoma, sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, vulvar carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and gastric cancer. According to our observations, the predominant risk factors to induce TLS in solid tumors are large tumor burden and liver metastases, rather than tumor sensitivity to therapy agents.\n\n【46】Liver metastases in solid tumors were found in most TLS cases, regardless whether patients had liver function abnormalities or not 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Apparently, liver involvement creates a risk for the development of TLS in solid malignancies, possible causes being high purine pools, increased tumor burden, and/or impaired uric acid metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【47】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【48】Even though TLS in solid tumors is a rare condition, physicians should be aware of it, especially in therapy-sensitive large burden tumors with metastatic disease, increased pretreatment LDH, renal impairment, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia, all of which are here documented to be mayor risk factors for the development of TLS.\n\n【49】If there is a possibility to develop TLS, the metabolic abnormalities should always be corrected before starting an anticancer regimen, since prevention is the best way to reduce its high morbidity and mortality.\n\n【50】In conclusion, TLS in solid tumors requires special attention for its prevention, early diagnosis, and management due to its poor clinical course. Physicians should be alert since improvement in the anticancer treatment may increase the incidence of TLS in solid tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:41:18", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:41:58", "cost": 39.887}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:41:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:41:18"}

Due to the propensity for hematogenous spread leading to fatal sepsis, the infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum have high mortality rate (65–80%) with death occurring in as less as one week of acquiring infection. So, prompt proper treatment is necessary for successful treatment of the infections but, due to the rarity of the infections caused by the organism, there is limited awareness among the clinicians regarding the infections caused by this organism. Here, we reported a case of urinary tract infection caused by Chromobacterium violaceum in a 84-year-old male, who was a kidney patient, and another case of bacteremia caused by the same bacterium in a road traffic accident patient (22-year-old male), both of which were managed with the timely suitable treatment.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Chromobacterium violaceum is ubiquitously present in the environment of tropical and subtropical regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a normal flora of water and soil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Human infections caused by this organism are very rare, due to which there is limited awareness about the infections caused by the bacterium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Till 2007, around 150 cases of human infections have been reported worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and recently four cases of infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum have been reported from Nepal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–5\\]</u>. In general, Chromobacterium violaceum is involved in causing fatal cases of sepsis, visceral abscesses, and skin and soft tissue infections with mortality rate up to 65–80% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. But urinary tract infections caused by this organism are extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In this study, we reported two cases of infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case 1 (Urinary Tract Infection)\n\n【5】An 84-year-old chronic kidney disease patient attended the outpatient department of a hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, with chief complaints of lower abdominal pain and fever. The patient had history of recurrent urinary tract infection for last 8 years. He was recently treated for urinary tract infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and was catheterized for last 2 weeks. After the necessary physical examination, the patient was suggested for laboratory investigation. In urine microscopic examination, significant bacteriuria with large numbers of pus cells per low power field was detected.\n\n【6】On the basis of the patient’s clinical symptoms, history of recurrent urinary tract infection, and urine microscopic examination report, the patient was empirically treated with ofloxacin. The abnormal laboratory findings seen were increased C-reactive protein (15 mg/dL), raised blood creatinine (2.7 mg/dL), and raised total leukocyte count (17,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) with neutrophilia (80%).\n\n【7】The clean catch urine plated on cystine lactose electrolyte deficient agar showed the growth of single type of bacterial colonies in the concentration more than 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/mL after 24 hrs of aerobic incubation at 37°C . The colonies grown were around 2 to 3 mm in diameter, convex, nonlactose fermenting, round, glistening, and smooth and produced violet nondiffusible pigment . The organism was Gram-negative rod and was motile and catalase and oxidase producing, citrate utilizing, and nitrate reducing. Further, the bacterial isolate decarboxylated arginine but did not decarboxylate lysine and ornithine and hydrolysed gelatin but did not hydrolyse esculin. It did not produce urease, indole, and DNase. Methyl red test and Voges-Proskauer test were negative. In triple sugar iron agar, it gave alkaline slant by acidic butt without any gas and hydrogen sulfide. The bacterium utilized glucose, fructose, and trehalose but did not utilize mannitol, sucrose, lactose, and xylose. The pigment formation was observed only after incubation under aerobic condition.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Colonies of Chromobacterium violaceum in cystine lactose electrolyte deficient agar.</u>\n\n【9】On the basis of all these properties, the organism was identified as Chromobacterium violaceum. For antimicrobial susceptibility testing, Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique was used. The organism was found to be sensitive toward ofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, amikacin, imipenem, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam and resistant toward nitrofurantoin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Due to high propensity of the organism for hematogenous dissemination, blood culture was performed to check its presence in blood, which was negative. As the organism was found to be susceptible to ofloxacin, it was continued for one week. Finally, the repeat urine culture was performed to ensure the treatment success and the urine culture did not show any growth.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Case 2 (Bacteremia)\n\n【11】A 22-year-old male road traffic accident patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, after receiving treatment for one week with no improvement in another hospital. The patient had multiple fractures with abrasion all over the body. The patient was serious but stable and had high body temperature. So, the necessary laboratory investigations were requested and the patient was put on meropenem, teicoplanin, and polymyxin B to cover all the bacterial infections including the nosocomial infections (if present), as the patient was transferred from another hospital.\n\n【12】There were no clinical and radiological evidences of visceral abscesses. The abnormal reports included low hemoglobin (9.6 gms/dL), leucocytosis (12250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) with neutrophilia (89%) and lymphocytopenia (4.2%), low packed cell volume (30.7%), and low red blood cells count (3.54 millions/mm<sup>3</sup>). The blood culture performed in BACTEC 9050 showed the growth of bacterial pathogen, which on further identification by phenotypic methods (as performed in case 1) was confirmed to be Chromobacterium violaceum . The antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique showed that the organism was susceptible to nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, meropenem, tigecycline, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin but resistant to ceftriaxone, cefepime and polymyxin B. So, on the basis of the culture report received, the treatment with meropenem was continued for one week and the patient was again screened for any infections, if present, by performing bacteriological culture of different clinical samples and all were negative.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Colonies of Chromobacterium violaceum in MacConkey agar.</u>\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【15】In Nepal, recently, the infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum have been increasingly reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–5\\]</u>. The reason for this may be either the increased rate of identification of the organism (due to development of sophisticated laboratory with skilled manpower) or the climate change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Due to temperature sensitivity of this organism, the effect of global climate change has caused Chromobacterium violaceum to spread to wider geographical location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. The organism has low virulence and is responsible for causing fatal sepsis in immunocompromised patients or in case of inappropriate antibiotic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our case, although the patients were immunocompromised, they did not develop any complications due to timely proper treatment they received.\n\n【16】The Chromobacterium violaceum infections are acquired either through oral route by consumption of contaminated water or food or due to exposure of damaged skin to contaminated soil or water (mainly stagnant or recreational water) or during surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. So, the road traffic accident patient might have got the infection through the abrasions present in his body, while chronic kidney disease patient might have got the infection due to urinary catheterization, which is also a risk factor for urinary tract infection. Similar to our study, Pant and Sharma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> from Nepal and Ma et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> from China reported the urinary tract infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum in kidney disease patients. However, Pant et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> from Nepal and Swain et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> from India reported the urinary tract infections caused by this organism in immunocompetent adults. In accordance with our case, Parajuli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported a case of bacteremia caused by Chromobacterium violaceum from Nepal which they managed with timely proper treatment, while Ansari et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported a case of fatal sepsis. Similarly, Mohan et al. reported a case of urinary tract infection caused by C. violaceum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, while Ray et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, Madi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, Karthik et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, and Kar et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> reported the cases of septicemia caused by the same organism in India. Further, Kaniyarakkal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> reported the cases of both urinary tract infection and septicemia from India.\n\n【17】Chromobacterium violaceum is known to be highly resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins but sensitive to carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 16\\]</u>. In our study also the organism isolated from the case of urinary tract infection was found to be resistant toward amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and nitrofurantoin but sensitive toward ofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, amikacin, imipenem, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Similar types of drug susceptibility patterns were also reported by Pant et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and Pant and Sharma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> in Chromobacterium violaceum isolated from two different cases of urinary tract infection. But, in contrast to our study, Swain et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reported the bacterium to be sensitive to nitrofurantoin; however, the susceptibility of the bacterium to other remaining antibiotics tested was similar to our study.\n\n【18】Similarly, in case of bacteremia patient the organism was susceptible to nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, meropenem, tigecycline, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin but resistant to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and polymyxin B. However, Parajuli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported the susceptibility of C. violaceum to cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones and resistance to polymyxin B.\n\n【19】Because of high possibility of hematogenous dissemination to visceral organs and frequent relapse, long courses of antimicrobial therapies are recommended for treatment of infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 17\\]</u> but we did not find any clinical or laboratory or radiological evidences of hematogenous spread and visceral abscesses. So, the treatment was given only for one week but a suggestion to visit hospital as soon as any suspicious symptoms appear was given to the outpatient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Similarly, the patient admitted to intensive care unit was put under strict observation for any suspicious symptoms.\n\n【20】As Chromobacterium violaceum has high tendency for hematogenous spreading causing sepsis which may cause death in as less as one week, the timely proper treatment is necessary to avoid the possible complications and hence to save patient’s life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our case, the patients did not get any complications related to Chromobacterium violaceum infection due to timely proper treatment they received.\n\n【21】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【22】The infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum may be treated successfully, if prompt proper treatment is started. For this, the clinicians should be aware of this rare but fatal infection. From Nepal, the infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum have been increasingly reported.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:50", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:05", "cost": 14.59}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:50"}

Initial treatment with pulsed corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, and cyclosporine seemed to suppress the activity of interstitial lung disease temporarily, but signs of relapse were detected such as elevation of serum KL-6 level and progressing pulmonary shadows in chest computed tomography scan. After polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column treatment, the areas of pulmonary shadows drastically decreased. Gradually, arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio recovered, and serum ferritin level and KL-6 level decreased. These findings indicate that polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column treatment could be promising in combination with conventional therapy for rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia associated with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis, especially at the early phase of relapse.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic connective tissue disease which is characterized by inflammation of the muscles and the skin. It is also a systemic disease involving the joints, esophagus, lungs, and heart. Clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (C-ADM) is characterized by typical cutaneous manifestations and minor involvement of skeletal muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is well known that the interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with C-ADM often presents with rapid onset and progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and that the type of ILD is resistant to conventional therapy and has a poor prognosis especially in East Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】It has been reported that direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column (PMX) effectively removed circulating endotoxin both in vitro and in vivo studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It was initially developed as a treatment for sepsis, and it has also revealed favorable effects on arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio in acute respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Here, we describe a patient of rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia associated with C-ADM whose relapse after intensive conventional therapy was successfully treated with PMX hemoperfusion.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 37-year-old man presented with skin rash for the last two months. He also had progressing dyspnea for the last two weeks and visited a hospital to consult with a physician. His oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was as low as 91% at room air in resting state, and he was admitted to the hospital. He had skin rashes in the face and on the hands. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed nonsegmental pulmonary infiltrate and grand-glass opacity mainly distributed in the subpleural areas of the lower lobes. In addition, there were some legions of consolidation with air bronchogram in the peripheral lung, which implied traction bronchiectasis. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis showed increases in total cells ( /mL) and lymphocyte fraction (64.5%). Culture of BALF was negative. In transbronchial lung biopsy samples, lymphocytes and macrophages was infiltrated, and masson body-like fibrotic foci was formed.\n\n【7】He was suspected of rapidly progressing interstitial lung disease with dermatomyositis and transferred to our hospital. He had Gottron’s papules, mechanic’s hands, and spotted rashes between eyebrows, but he did not have heliotrope rash or other rashes on joints or body trunk. Manual muscle testing revealed no muscle weakness both in proximal and distal muscles. Fine crackles were audible in the bilateral lower lung fields. Laboratory findings on admission revealed a white blood cell count of 4,200/mm<sup>3</sup> with 76.1% neutrophils C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (3.21 mg/dL \\[standard value; 0–0.4 mg/dL\\]). His serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), KL-6, ferritin, aldolase, and D-Dimer levels were elevated (586 IU/L \\[119–229 IU/L\\]), 1835 U/mL \\[<500 U/mL\\], 842 ng/mL \\[20–280 ng/mL\\], 14.1 U/L \\[2.7–7.5 U/L\\], and 12.4 μg/mL \\[<1.0 μg/mL\\], resp.), but creatine kinase (CK) was not elevated (201 U/L \\[55-210 U/L\\]). He did not have antinuclear antibody, anti-Jo-1 antibody, or other anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with the patient’s serum revealed that he had a 140 kD protein band, which is supposed to be C-ADM-140/MDA5 antibody; however, further determination was not available in our case. Arterial blood gas test at O<sub>2</sub> inhalation of 3 L/min with nasal cannula revealed decreased levels of PaO<sub>2</sub> (68.7 Torr) and PaCO<sub>2</sub> (31.7 Torr). Plasma b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was <4.0 pg/mL \\[<18.4 pg/mL\\], and ultrasound cardiography revealed that his cardiac function was normal. Skin biopsy was performed, and the findings were compatible with dermatomyositis. Electromyogram or magnetic resonance imaging of thigh muscles was omitted because respiratory failure was progressing and the treatment was made the highest priority. There were no signs of malignancy so far as we could check.\n\n【8】He was diagnosed as clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (C-ADM) with rapidly progressing interstitial pneumonia and treated with pulsed corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g/day, days 0–3, 16–18) followed by high dose corticosteroids, intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY; 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, day 3, 22; 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, day 41), intravenous immunoglobulin (20 g/day, days 6–10, 48–52), and cyclosporine-A (CSA; 200 mg/day, days 0–5; 250–300 mg/day, days 6-). Anticoagulation treatment with heparin followed by warfarin was also used (days 0-). In response to these initial treatments, consolidations and grand-glass opacities decreased in chest CT scans . Oxygen demand decreased from 4 L/min to 1-2 L/min to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> level at 90–95% in resting state. However, serum ferritin kept increasing and began to decrease two weeks afterwards.\n\n【9】On day 29, chest CT scans revealed progressing interstitial shadows again . CK was not elevated (130 U/L). Plasma BNP was slightly elevated (26.9 pg/mL), but there were no signs of heart failure. Although his oxygen demand or respiratory symptoms had not changed significantly, we thought that his interstitial lung disease was relapsing. Since a relapse after initial treatment of rapidly progressive ILD is often fatal, we decided to conduct intensive care in this early phase of the relapse, thus applied hemoperfusion treatment in this moment. On days 30 and 31, he underwent single course of PMX treatment, which was carried out at a flow rate of 80–100 mL/min for 12 h, twice at an interval of 24 h. Nafamostat mesilate (Torii Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used for anticoagulation. Following the hemoperfusion, the findings detected by chest X-ray and CT scans improved remarkably, and the serum ferritin kept decreasing. Oxygen demand improved gradually, reflected in the increase in arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio (from 215 to 313), whereas serum concentration of LDH and KL-6 still remained at high level . The dosage of oral corticosteroid was tapered gradually, and he was discharged with a prescription of 30 mg of prednisolone and 250 mg of cyclosporine.

Discussion\n\n【13】We report a case of rapidly progressive ILD with C-ADM, whose relapse in spite of intensive therapy was successfully prevented by PMX hemoperfusion. We think that PMX is a potent therapeutic option in combination with the conventional treatment, especially in the early phase of the relapse of the ILD with C-ADM.\n\n【14】Acute/subacute interstitial lung disease in patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) is frequently fatal within months despite high dose prednisolone (PSL) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Acute/subacute ILD is more common in patients with C-ADM, which results in higher mortality rate in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is often resistant to conventional therapy and has poor prognosis especially in East Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. It was reported that HRCT patterns differed between anti-C-ADM-140 positive and negative patients in DM; lower lobes consolidation or ground-glass attenuation (GGA) pattern (50.0%) and random GGA pattern (33.3%) were the predominant patterns, and intralobular reticular opacities were absent in anti-C-ADM-140 positive cases, while lower lobes reticulation pattern (69.2%) was frequently seen in anti-C-ADM-140 negative cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. NSIP and DAD were seen in histological examinations of acute/subacute ILD with C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Furthermore, C-ADM-associated interstitial pneumonia takes an aggressive course even when the radiological and histological features are consistent with NSIP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In the present case, the radiological features were mostly consistent with lower lobes consolidation or GGA pattern, and there was traction bronchiectasis on admission, which is a predictor of rapid progression and poor prognosis of ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>; therefore he received intensive initial treatment with pulsed corticosteroids and IVCY, intravenous immunoglobulin, oral CSA, and warfarin.\n\n【15】It was reported that combination therapy with pulsed corticosteroids, CSA, and IVCY was promising for acute/subacute ILD with DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It was reported that early intervention with CSA in combination with corticosteroid was effective, with tightly monitoring 2 h postdose blood concentration (C2) of CSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 13\\]</u>. In this case, we also used CSA as an initial treatment and monitored trough as well as C2 level of CSA. There are reports that intravenous immunoglobulin is effective for ILD with DM/PM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>, and we also applied it twice with an interval of a month.\n\n【16】Although pulmonary coagulopathy is suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of ILD, effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy for ILD is controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>. As a maintenance therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), warfarin had negative effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. On the other hand, anticoagulation is known to be beneficial in acute exacerbation of various ILDs including IPF and C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. In our case, the patient presented with elevated plasma D-Dimer on admission, which might have indicated thrombus formation in pulmonary microcirculation, and we decided to begin anticoagulant therapy as an acute phase treatment.\n\n【17】In the present case, the intensive initial treatment with pulsed corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide twice, respectively, intravenous immunoglobulin once, and oral cyclosporine and warfarin succeeded in the induction of the remission to the rapidly progressing ILD with C-ADM. However, relapse was suspected soon after the initial treatment as progressing interstitial shadows without any signs of heart dysfunction. Although CT findings at the time of suspected relapse were not so prominent, we judged thatitwas a critical time point to decide good or poor prognosis; thus we conducted polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column (PMX) treatment.\n\n【18】PMX treatment was initially developed as a treatment for sepsis by removing circulating endotoxin. It has also revealed favorable effects on (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio in acute respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The number of reports is limited, but it was also effective for rapidly progressing ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19–21\\]</u>. It has been reported that PMX treatment was also effective for ILD with C-ADM in combination with conventional treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22–24\\]</u>. Although there remains the possibility that the other immunosuppressants finally become effective, it seems that PMX played the major role in this case, since the progressing pulmonary infiltrates quickly cleared just after the PMX treatment.\n\n【19】However, the mechanism by which PMX improves pulmonary oxygenation in acute exacerbation of ILD (AE-ILD) has not been elucidated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The removal of plasma endotoxin does not have a major role, because serum levels of endotoxin were within the normal range in previously reported cases of AE-ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 22, 25–27\\]</u>. PMX treatment was known to reduce metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>, neutrophil reactive oxygen species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>, neutrophil elastase, and interleukin-8 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. These mediators cause lung injury and increase vascular permeability as well as the intrapulmonary shunt ratio. These mediators are known to be released from neutrophils and monocytes. It has been shown that the polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column itself traps activated blood neutrophils and monocytes, which may be involved in the reduction of releasing mediators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31–33\\]</u>. In our case, blood neutrophil count and monocyte count were not reduced after PMX treatment. The mechanism by which PMX treatment improved the ILD should be studied further. A long perfusion duration (12 h) of PMX had better prognosis than short course (<6 h) for AE-ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 25\\]</u>, and we also applied 12 h for a hemoperfusion duration.\n\n【20】It has been reported that serum ferritin correlates with the activity of the ILD with C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. In our case, serum ferritin kept increasing for about a week after initiating intensive immunosuppressive therapies and began to decrease afterwards. There seemed to be a time lag of approximately two weeks between the decline of disease activity and decrease of the serum ferritin level.\n\n【21】KL-6 is a mucin-like glycoprotein expressed on type II pneumocytes. Serum KL-6 level has diagnostic and prognostic significance in ILD or acute respiratory distress syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35, 36\\]</u>. It has better diagnostic accuracy of ILD in comparison to SP-A, SP-D, and MCP-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37, 38\\]</u>. Serum KL-6 is known to be elevated even 7–10 days after successful treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39, 40\\]</u>, which is compatible with our case.\n\n【22】Anticlinically amyopathic dermatomyositis- (C-ADM-) 140/MDA5 autoantibodies have been known to be a specific marker for C-ADM and strongly associated with rapidly progressive ILD with C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. Furthermore, their quantification may be useful for monitoring ILD activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.\n\n【23】In summary, we report a case of rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia associated with C-ADM, whose relapse after intensive initial treatment was successfully prevented with single course of PMX hemoperfusion. PMX may be a potent therapeutic option in combination with conventional therapies for ILD associated with C-ADM, especially in the early phase of the relapse.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:00:18", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:00:45", "cost": 27.273}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:00:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:00:17"}

This work aimed to describe a case series of children diagnosed with dengue presenting neurological disease in Huila Province of Colombia. Eleven pediatric febrile patients confirmed for dengue disease and presenting neurological signs were studied in the University Hospital of Neiva, Huila Province. Clinical and laboratory findings, CSF cytochemical analysis, neurology images, and serology and molecular studies were performed. Viral RNA was detected in all patients’ sera by RT-PCR. Nine out of 11 were primary infections. Tonic-clonic seizures (73%), consciousness alterations (27%), irritability (27%), and ataxia (18%) were the most frequent neurological signs. None of the patients had plasma leakage, hypovolemic shock, or liver disease, confirming the encephalitis diagnosis. Diagnostic images did not show abnormal findings, but neither bacterial nor fungal infections were detected in CSF analysis. All patients survived without sequelae except for one patient that presented ataxia for months. In conclusion, we described a group of children with neurological signs during severe dengue disease as the main finding, indicating the importance to including dengue as a differential diagnosis in neurological patients from endemic areas.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The world estimate of dengue infections is around 390 million people among symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in endemic countries such as those of Latin America and the Asian, Southeast, and Pacific Islands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Nearly 65% of Colombian municipalities reported constant Aedes infestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and dengue incidence increase year after year mainly associated with abnormal environmental sanitary conditions, broad circulation of the four serotypes, and high mosquito infestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. In America, most of the cases occur in individuals under 15 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The largest dengue occurred in Latin America was reported in 2019 with more than three million cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> reaching an incidence rate of 80 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n【5】The current disease classification propose is to identify dengue following clinical signs and symptoms to establish the most accurate diagnosis and recognize early cases that could become severe or fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Accordingly, dengue warning signs reflecting endothelial dysfunction that should be revised are abdominal tenderness, vomit, edema, mucosal bleeding, hepatomegaly, irritability, or hypotension. In those presumptive dengue cases occurring with plasma leakage signs (pleural effusion and pericarditis) or respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or affectation of organs such as the liver, brain, or kidney, a diagnostic of severe dengue should be corroborated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Even although neurological manifestations were reported since 1976 in Thailand as “dengue-associated acute encephalopathy” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, from these years until today, the incidence of neurologic manifestations during dengue disease has increased considerably 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Similar cases have been reported from the Asian, Southeast, and Pacific Islands of America 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Today, some hypotheses proposes that DENV could also be neurotropic as other flaviviruses supported by the frequent finding of specific IgM or viral RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u> that could confirm CNS infection and direct brain injury. This finding allows the differentiation of those circulating viruses and antibodies that could enter to the CNS due to impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).\n\n【7】Many kinds of pathologies have been reported, from cerebral edema and hemorrhage to perivascular lymphocyte infiltrates and demyelination foci. These anomalies could be explained by i) BBB alterations induced by TNF-alpha and IL-6 activity involved in endothelial junction disruption favoring virus entry to the CNS, ii) DENV infection to endothelial cells leading to virion pass through to brain parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>, and iii) endothelial cell injury by glycocalyx remodeling induced by NS1. Nervous system DENV replication has been observed in the olivary nucleus and cerebellum as well as tissue macrophages DENV positive, indicating some neurotropism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【8】It has been reported that 47% of adult meningitis and encephalitis cases in a Brazilian endemic area were explained by acute DENV infection occurring during the first week of fever onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. During that outbreak, the disorder did appear as encephalitis with behavioral disorders, seizures, and paresis with no evidence of liver failure and confirming serum or CSF IgM serology or altered neuroimages showing brain changes. Other cases with unspecific neurological signs could appear as a consequence of metabolic alterations or prolonged shock, brain hypoxia, cerebral edema, or liver or kidney failure that explain the headache, retro-orbital pain, insomnia, restlessness, and mood changes appearing in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The Colombian study reported by Mendez and Gonzalez 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> described 46 out of 168 severe dengue child patients presenting encephalopathy and 3 with encephalitis diagnostic. Dengue encephalitis is considered when febrile patients in endemic areas, having one of these signs or symptoms, headache, seizures, consciousness alterations, and behavioral changes with no hepatic failure or bleeding and positive for DENV serology or molecular test in serum or CSF with altered brain images in tomography or resonance. The purpose of this article is to present and describe the clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic characteristics of eleven children diagnosed as dengue cases, which presented neurological manifestations, cases occurring during regular endemic circulation in the Colombian province of Huila in 2011. DENV spreading in Latin-American countries and inside of them has been explained by air traffic between cities, urban population size, and human development index, which predict positively the outbreaks in those endemic cities like Neiva studied here (Allicock).\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Cases Presentation\n\n【10】The University Hospital Hernando Moncaleano is the largest health setting in Neiva, the capital city of Huila Province, located at 42 meters above sea level with a mean temperature of 28°C where it has been reported frequent dengue outbreaks. The Hospital Institutional Review Board approved the study and parents or guardians signed the consent form during the stay. We collected the clinical and laboratory information of those febrile patients with one of dengue symptoms such as rash, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, and arthralgia associated with any neurological signs such as seizures, abnormal movements, acute flaccid palsy, lethargy, meningeal signs, or consciousness alteration with no shock evidence, which were diagnosed as severe dengue following the recommendation of the WHO. Clinical records from the pediatric emergency department were revised from March to October 2011 and those patients with neurological signs and another microorganism associated were excluded. One specific designed clinical report form was filled for each case, and complete information of laboratory tests (blood cell counts, coagulation tests, liver, and kidney function markers), diagnostic images (tomography and chest Rx), and CSF chemical and microbiological analysis was collected; however, other viral pathogens were not evaluated. Sera from the enrolled cases were processed for serum IgM and capture IgG detection by ELISA and for viral RNA detection by RT-PCR on sera following the protocol described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【11】During the study period, 34 patients with fever and neurological manifestations were examined, but three were excluded (one by mental retardation and two with psychiatric disorders); the remaining 31 patients were investigated for dengue by serology or sera RT-PCR, and eleven (35.5%) tested positive for any of them (two girls and nine boys). All of them, finally, were discharged with severe dengue diagnostic or viral encephalitis, despite all of them having positive dengue IgM or IgG test in serum. All but one patient had laboratory analysis, although this one had serology and RT-PCR results. Most of the patients (73%) presented seizure disorder or convulsions. In Table 1, the complete data of patients are shown. Although all patients were IgM positive, only two were IgG positive (secondary infection). All sera were positive for RT-PCR for DENV, but only three of them allowed serotyping (DENV-1).\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Clinical and laboratory findings of evaluated patients.</u>\n\n【13】Clinically, eight patients presented tonic-clonic seizures although only 2/11 reported headache and three developed consciousness alteration or irritability, two had ataxia symptoms, and one developed unilateral paresis. Other signs found were vomiting 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>, hepatomegaly 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>, cough 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>, abdominal pain 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>, asthenia 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>, and epistaxis 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. None of the patients presented plasma leakage signs such as edema or pleural effusion, nor altered transaminase values. There was brain tomography in eight patients and one magnetic resonance, all showing no alterations. Additionally, chest Rx from three patients was normal. Despite the severity, there was no fatal case, and all of them, but one, recovered without sequelae.\n\n【14】The hematimetric analysis indicated anemia and low hematocrit in all patients (median 33.5%, IQR 31.8-34.6%) since the child normal value is 36–42%. A mild leukocytosis was observed at day one and a decrease until day four when leukopenia was evident. Six patients developed thrombocytopenia with the day 6 value being the lowest (median 99.200 platelets/mm<sup>3</sup>). The coagulation prothrombin test only showed a mean of 15.4 s; it means a prolongation value at the first hospitalization day. However, the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was prolonged during six hospitalization days with values between 32.3 and 35.1 s . Transaminase levels used to evaluate the hepatic function and AST showed a slight increase during the last three hospitalization days (fifth to the seventh day), but the values were close to those reference levels while ALT did not show changed levels. There were no changes in renal function markers in any of the patients.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Hematologic parameters description according to hospitalization day (mean (IQR) \\[n\\]).</u>\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Colombia has seen an increase in the dengue cases number in the last decade with higher severity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>, forcing medical personnel and health authorities to strengthen capacity to recognize and differentiate classical dengue signs and symptoms from the atypical and severe presentation. After the redefinition of diagnostic and severity criteria by the WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>, severe dengue is defined when patients present organ damage, associated signs (liver, brain, and kidney), or hypovolemic shock or massive bleeding. This system facilitates the early recognition of the most severe cases by reducing the mortality numbers.\n\n【18】This study presented eleven severe dengue cases in children between eight months to 10 years of age, living in the Colombian province Huila, a hyperendemic area that reported two-fifths of severe dengue cases registered from 2000 to 2011 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. All patients presented brain compromise; nine were diagnosed as not only encephalitis (81.8%) following the criteria described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>, such as fever, sensory disturbances, seizures, or focal neurological signs, but also positive tests (IgM or NS1) or RT-PCR in serum or CSF and negative for others encephalitis causes. This presentation was the most common compromise in this series, characterized by seizures in six patients (tonic-clonic convulsions) as has been previously reported in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. There was one severe sensory impairment case, and another presented with severe headache, which also is frequently described in dengue encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Less than half of the described patients develop classical dengue signs such as vomiting, hepatomegaly, and exanthem, indicating the neurological cases do not seem to have dengue disease and that nervous signs could appear alone leading to registration of severe cases and possibly in the delay of the establishment of adequate treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Two patients were diagnosed as cerebellitis, characterized by nystagmus, dysarthria, or ataxia, which also has been reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Fortunately, there were no fatal cases in this patient group; on the contrary, outcomes and recovery were satisfactory.\n\n【19】It is recommended that, in DENV circulation areas, those patients with fever and neurologic signs should be investigated for dengue disease, ensuring laboratory confirmation using both serology and molecular tests that, together, could offer high sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Here, we used both IgM and IgG serology in addition to RT-PCR and found all serum samples positive, even serotyping DENV-1 in three patients, which is not the most reported associated with neuroinfection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. The finding of nine sera negative for IgG is very odd because most of the severe dengue cases are during secondary infections with a different serotype, where the antibodies are not capable of the second virus neutralization but induce an enhanced infection and an aberrant immune response. Therefore, severe dengue with a primary compromise of an organ in primoinfection could suggest a neurotropic strain or a host characteristic that determined the neuroinfection in this child group.\n\n【20】All CSF samples were negative for bacteria or fungi, but five out of nine had lymphocyte pleocytosis, an uncommon sign in dengue encephalitis; since most of the cases do not develop CSF anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>, even three-quarters of dengue encephalitis or meningitis patients showed normal values in CSF analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Despite previous studies reported that brain tissue damage is detectable by tomography images, the children described in this work did not present anomalies. Although it is preferable to use magnetic resonance for brain evaluation because of the accuracy of this technique, regularly imaging abnormalities during dengue encephalitis are not specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> and are still poorly defined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 30\\]</u>, although ischemia or hemorrhage must be sought 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. On the other hand, we found normal leukocyte counts instead of the classical leukopenia of dengue with warning signs or severe dengue, which pose a difficulty to early diagnosis, although there was thrombocytopenia only at day six of hospitalization with no changes in ALT and AST transaminases as reported previously. Recently, 11/36 patients from a Brazilian endemic area were diagnosed with neurologic manifestations and confirmed for arbovirus infection using CSF or sera 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u> (5 DENV and 6 CHIKV), posing an additional warning about involvement of these viruses in severe disease presentation in Latin-American countries where there is cocirculation.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【22】This child group were diagnosed as severe dengue with central nervous system manifestations without shock, typical signs, or hemorrhage. Therefore, we should recommend that, in endemic dengue areas, health professionals should include infections by this virus in those patients with fever and neurological manifestations as part of the primary diagnostic and must be vigilant for neurological signs that could appear after acute dengue disease.\n\n【23】#### 5\\. Limitations\n\n【24】This study was retrospective and is limited by its observational nature. Although we enrolled almost all those children with severe dengue diagnosis in this hospital, detailed clinical and laboratory information was obtained from these reported patients after an in-depth search of data in the medical records.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:39:06", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:39:22", "cost": 16.009}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:39:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:39:06"}

We describe here the successful use of percutaneous biventricular Impella (Bi-Pella) for cardiogenic shock secondary to acute biventricular myocardial infarctions (AMI-CS), as guided by parameters such as mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi), central venous pressure (CVP), and cardiac power output (CPO). We aim to highlight the promising outcomes of timely implanted biventricular Impella in (AMI-CS).\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cardiogenic shock is responsible for a significant percentage of morbidity and mortality after acute MI. However, early identification of cardiogenic shock and the early use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) result in favorable outcomes. The Detroit Cardiogenic Shock Initiative described that patients with AMI and cardiogenic shock were supported with Impella (Abiomed, Inc. Danvers, Massachusetts, USA) before PCI resulted in survival to device removal of 89% and survival to discharge of 84% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We present a case of AMI-CS in which a patient underwent insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and associated coronary revascularization. Despite this, he experienced resistant cardiogenic shock that necessitated Impella CP and subsequent Impella RP, which resulted in a dramatic improvement in his hemodynamic parameters and overall condition.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. History of Presentation\n\n【5】A 43-year-old man transferred from a non-PCI-capable hospital with acute onset chest pain for 4 h. He had no associated shortness of breath, cough, or fever. On examination, his blood pressure was 100/58 mm Hg, pulse rate was 120 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min, oxygen saturation was 96% on room air, and his temperature was 37.2°C. He was fully conscious and had cold extremities. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds and jugular venous distension. Lungs were clear with good air movement bilaterally, and the rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Learning Objective\n\n【7】 Case: a patient who presented with resistant cardiogenic shock secondary to acute myocardial infarction.通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>We consider the early use of biventricular Impella in resistant cardiogenic shock secondary to acute myocardial infarction.\n\n【8】##### 2.2. Medical History\n\n【9】The patient did not have any past medical history.\n\n【10】##### 2.3. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【11】The differential diagnosis of acute chest pain without hypoxia in such a 43-year-old man is broad. A typical presentation of acute coronary syndrome was a major concern. Other differential diagnoses include acute heart failure and acute pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\n【12】##### 2.4. Investigations\n\n【13】Results of the patient’s laboratory tests were as follows: high-sensitivity (hs) cardiac troponin (cTn) was 2700 ng/l (normal range < 14 ng/L), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) was 40% (normal range 65–70%), and serum creatinine was 398 μmol/L (baseline creatinine level was not available). An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in leads III, avF, and V3– V4 and new-onset right bundle branch block, and the rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe biventricular dysfunction, and the estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 15%.\n\n【14】##### 2.5. Management\n\n【15】He presented to a non-PCI capable hospital and was treated with fibrinolytic therapy. The patient was then transferred to our center for rescue PCI, which revealed chronic total occlusion (CTO) of mid-LAD, acute occlusion of the RCA, and critical occlusion of the left midcircumflex coronary artery. The operator inserted the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and referred the patient to surgical revascularization.\n\n【16】A few hours later, the patient became more hypotensive, and we elected to proceed with PCI, with successful stenting to RCA, LCX, along with the insertion of Impella CP support. The mid-LAD (CTO) was left for a staged procedure. Despite successful coronary revascularization and Impella CP support, the patient developed overt cardiogenic shock, resistant to intravenous fluid and vasopressors. The next morning, repeat mixed venous oxygen saturation remained as low as 40%, and transthoracic echocardiography showed persistent severe biventricular dysfunction with akinetic and severely dilated right ventricle.\n\n【17】Based on the clinical presentation and workup findings, the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to acute inferior myocardial infarction was made. In an attempt to improve his worsening hemodynamic instability, Impella CP (Abiomed, Inc. Danvers, Massachusetts, USA) was deployed and achieved 3.2 L/min of flow at performance level 8 (performance level ranges from P0 to P9), along with successful removal of IABP therapy. The anticoagulation therapy targeted an activated clotting time between 160 and 180 s with heparin. On the next day, his right ventricular function hemodynamic parameters indicated a picture of poor right ventricular function , and there was evidence of severe RV dilatation and systolic dysfunction on bedside echocardiogram. Impella RP was then inserted and achieved 3.4 L/min of flow activated at P7 . Weaning off Impella devices after 24 hours included stepwise reduction of support level to evaluate the recovery of each ventricle. Impella CP was implanted for a total of 5 days and 4 days for the Impella RP. He underwent 7 continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) sessions to manage his severe acute kidney injury. A marked improvement of renal and liver function parameters was noticed in the first week after successful explanation of Impella devices. On hospital day 18, the patient was discharged from the coronary care unit, to spend another 14 days in the ward before being discharged home, with LVEF improved to 35%.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Hemodynamic parameters before and after biventricular impella support.</u>\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 A fluoroscopic image showing the Bi-Pella configuration using the Impella CP and Impella RP axial flow catheters.</u>\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 In situ Bi-Pella: consoles for the right and left ventricle.</u>\n\n【21】#### 3\\.

This alarming data have laid the road for the utility of MCS in AMI-CS. Impella CP and RP are examples of microaxial percutaneous MCS devices. They both have different yet similar functions; for the Impella CP, blood is pumped from the left ventricle towards the ascending aorta , and as for the Impella RP, blood is pumped from the vena cava towards the pulmonary arteries  bypassing a failing right ventricle.\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Echocardiographic view of the two pumps in place.</u>\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Echocardiographic view of the Impella RP in the right ventricular outflow tract.</u>\n\n【25】With data suggesting that LV dysfunction (LVD) is responsible for the vast majority of shock after AMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>, results from the IABP-SHOCK II trial, and evidence suggesting improved survival benefits with early application of Impella CP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, one can understand the reasons behind its increased use in such clinical scenarios. Despite that, it may provide up to 4.0 liters per minute of forwarding flow; some patients, such as in our case, remain hemodynamically unstable. A possible explanation for this is the presence of concomitant severe right ventricular dysfunction (RVD). In fact, in most cases, concurrent RV failure, requiring MCS, is detected after the application of LV hemodynamic support devices or at the initial stages of evaluating a patient presenting with severe biventricular failure.\n\n【26】The pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi), defined as \\[(systolic pulmonary artery pressure– diastolic pulmonary artery pressure)/central venous pressure\\], is a reliable predictor of outcome in AMI-CS secondary to RV failure, with values <0.9 suggesting RVD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Poor RV function is strongly associated with a PAPi <0.9 and cardiac power output (CPO) <0.6, especially in patients who are already receiving LV hemodynamic support therapy. Time is a major consideration in RV failure (RVF); ideal management would aim to effectively minimize the delay between the incidence of RVF and implantation of right ventricular hemodynamic support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Due to persistent RV hemodynamic instability, the team elected to insert an Impella RP device, just 24 hours after implantation of Impella CP.\n\n【27】This resulted in significant correction of cardiac index, CVP, SvO2, PAPi, and CPO , which strongly correlates with the Recover Right Study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【28】##### 3.1.

Conclusions\n\n【31】We report the first case from the Middle East of AMI complicated by the refractory cardiogenic shock due to biventricular failure that was successfully managed with the early utility of Impella CP and RP (Bi-Pella).

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare, life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy due to an acquired autoantibody to ADAMTS13 that requires a boutique treatment, urgent plasma exchange. Thus, TTP is often termed a “cannot miss” diagnosis. Case. We report a patient with TTP who had a history of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), had atypical demographics for TTP, and had also met criteria for primary Sjogren’s syndrome. This exceedingly rare combination presented a temptation to dismiss TTP as a diagnosis. Discussion. Our case further demonstrates the practical utility of using the PLASMIC score as a tool that can help identify patients with TTP even when the patient has statistically rare characteristics.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are two separate diseases that are characterized by low platelets.\n\n【4】Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired hematologic disorder caused by immune-mediated destruction of platelets that can be classified as idiopathic or secondary to another disease process. ITP is a clinical diagnosis that rests on the presence of isolated thrombocytopenia while excluding other causes of thrombocytopenia and identifying conditions that may be causing secondary ITP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy caused by an acquired autoantibody that leads to decreased activity of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 that results in hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. While the treatment courses for both ITP and TTP may include corticosteroids and rituximab, a key treatment difference is urgent therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for all patients with TTP, whereas TPE is not effective for ITP.\n\n【6】In this article, we report a case of sequential ITP and TTP in a patient with primary Sjogren’s syndrome who was diagnosed in part due to the utility of the PLASMIC scoring system.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 72-year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed in 2019 with ITP after he presented to his local emergency department (ED) with bruising on his left arm, transient hematuria, melena, persistent epistaxis, and a platelet count of 4,000/µL. A complete blood count showed that his hemoglobin level was 14.0 g/dL and also confirmed the severe thrombocytopenia. Hemolysis labs showed LDH 192 U/L, total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL, haptoglobin 52 mg/dL, and reticulocyte count 1.6%. His presentation was felt to be drug-induced ITP from apixaban that was started several months earlier. He received 1 mg/kg prednisone and was transfused 1 unit of platelets before being admitted. Despite steroids and 2 additional platelet transfusions over the next two days, his platelets remained 4,000/µL, prompting transfer to our facility for IVIG consideration .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 ITP diagnosis and treatment timeline. Major dates in the patient’s initial ITP presentation and treatment course occurring in 2019 are listed along the x\\-axis with accompanying hash marks and events above. Daily platelet counts (/µL) and LDH (U/L) where available are listed below respective dates. The above timeline includes major therapies with which the patient was treated, spanning across dates received including prednisone 1 mg/kg (blue bar), IVIG (red bar), dexamethasone 40 mg (yellow bar), and romiplostim 120 mcg (green bar). Overlapping bars imply multiple treatments given on same days.</u>\n\n【10】On arrival, his platelet count was 0k/µL. His peripheral smear showed thrombocytopenia with giant platelets, some rouleaux formation, occasional large granular lymphocytes with otherwise normal red and white cell morphology, and no fragmented cells or schistocytes. His workup was significant for elevated rheumatoid factor to 71 IU/ml, ANA positive at >1:640 with a speckled pattern, ESR of 53 mm/hr, negative lupus anticoagulant, negative cardiolipin antibody, negative beta-2 glycoprotein, negative hepatitis C, negative hepatitis B, and negative apixaban-dependent platelet antibody. Bone marrow biopsy showed normocellular age with normal megakaryocytes.\n\n【11】The patient was treated with dexamethasone 40 mg × 4 days and IVIG 1 g/kg × 2. His platelet count increased to 12,000/µL. Following this therapy, his platelet count dropped to 5,000/µL. He received romiplostim 120 (1 mcg/kg) mcg daily. After 6 days of romiplostim, his platelet count was 9,000/µL, so he received rituximab (375 mg/m2; 850 mg infusion) as well as mycophenolate (1,000 mg twice daily). At discharge, his platelet count was 22,000/µL, and he was continued on romiplostim 2 mcg/kg, mycophenolate, and rituximab. One week later, his platelet count was 72,000/µL, and he received one additional rituximab infusion before being followed with observation. Over the next 13 months, his platelet count was between 74,000/µL and 157,000/µL.\n\n【12】In September 2020, nearly 19 months after initially presenting with ITP, our patient presented to his local ED with hematuria and epistaxis again. His platelet count was 9,000/µL, hemoglobin was 12 g/dL, and total bilirubin was 5.3 mg/dL. A relapse of his ITP was diagnosed. He was initially treated with dexamethasone 8 mg and transferred to our facility for possible rituximab infusion. On arrival, his platelet count was 2,000/µL, hemoglobin was 11.1 g/dL (down from a baseline of 15), and schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear. He had a new acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 2.41 mg/dL (up from a baseline of 1 mg/dL) and an LDH of 2,399 U/L. A haptoglobin level was undetectable, and reticulocyte count was 2.1%.\n\n【13】The new hemolytic anemia as well as the severe thrombocytopenia raised the possibility of TTP. The patient had several characteristics that were statistically uncommon for TTP patients. Namely, he was male, in his seventies, and Caucasian. Furthermore, he had an existing diagnosis of ITP as well as symptoms that were nearly identical to his previous presentation with ITP. However, ITP alone would not explain his hemolytic anemia. Thus, the PLASMIC score was used, and his score was high. This meant that the probability of TTP was high based on this scoring system.\n\n【14】Given the high likelihood for TTP, he received urgent plasmapheresis . He also received prednisone (1 mg/kg; 110 mg). The diagnosis of TTP was confirmed during his first plasmapheresis by a severely low ADAMTS13 activity of 9% as well as the presence of an inhibitor.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 TTP diagnosis and treatment timeline.

The above timeline includes major therapies with which the patient was treated, spanning across dates received including dexamethasone 40 mg (red bar), prednisone 1 mg/kg (blue bar), and plasma exchange (TPE, green bar). Overlapping bars imply multiple treatments given on same days.</u>\n\n【16】Given his positive rheumatoid factor, positive ANA, and multiple autoimmune conditions, rheumatology was also consulted. He had a positive SSA and positive Schirmer’s test of the left eye. Thus, he met ACR/EULAR classification criteria for primary Sjogren’s syndrome. Given his atypical demographics for Sjogren’s and lack of classic sicca symptoms, a labial salivary gland biopsy was performed but was not consistent with Sjogren’s syndrome. Rheumatology suggested he may have Sjogren’s secondary to SLE given  the positive ANA, low C4, and association between SLE and TTP. However, his dsDNA, RNP, Smith, and APS were all negative.\n\n【17】His hospital course was complicated by MSSA bacteremia.This was presumably due to his apheresis/dialysis central venous catheter, so it was removed. Both TTE and TEE showed no evidence of vegetations. He was started on cefepime before narrowing to cefazolin with an outpatient plan of daptomycin for 4 weeks of total antibiotic therapy.\n\n【18】He received daily TPE x14. He also received rituximab (375 mg/m2; 800 mg infusion) once a week x4. Dose 1 of this series was after TPE #7, dose 2 was after TPE #14, and doses 3 and 4 were over the following 2 weeks. Eventually, his platelets plateaued to around 120,000/uL. This was close to his baseline of around 130,000–150,000/uL during the previous year after he had been treated for ITP. He was discharged and did well at home. A month after discharge, his platelets increased to 179,000/uL without any significant drops.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion made in patients with isolated thrombocytopenia due to immune-mediated destruction of platelets. The diagnosis of ITP includes careful evaluation of the patient’s history and physical examination along with laboratory testing including review of the peripheral smear to rule out other potential causes of thrombocytopenia. The pathogenesis of ITP is incompletely understood. Antibody-mediated destruction is generally considered the most common cause, as 60–70% of patients have platelet-specific immunoglobulin G autoantibodies, most commonly to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Other reported mechanisms include T-cell-mediated destruction of platelets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and impaired megakaryopoiesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Despite these frequent antibody associations, current antibody tests have been consistently demonstrated to be poorly sensitive and poorly specific for ITP in nearly all studies that have been published. Thus, ITP is a clinical diagnosis since no widely validated antibody test exists as of this writing.\n\n【21】In 80% of ITP cases, the cause is idiopathic. The other 20% of cases are secondary to conditions such as autoimmune syndromes, immunodeficiency syndromes, infections, lymphoid malignancies, and medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Treatment for newly diagnosed primary ITP is typically reserved for patients with clinically significant bleeding and severely low platelets (<30,000/microL), as the overall risk for bleeding in ITP is low. The primary first-line treatment of ITP is corticosteroids. Increased or normalized platelet counts are usually seen within two weeks, and this response to therapy is sometimes used in practice as a confirmatory test of sorts.\n\n【22】TTP is also a disorder that is characterized by thrombocytopenia, but TTP includes microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) in addition to severe thrombocytopenia. While the pentad of fever, neurological and renal abnormalities, MAHA, and thrombocytopenia is classically associated with TTP, the full pentad is only seen in 5% of cases and should not be relied upon as a sensitive set of criteria for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. In addition, while schistocytes or red cell fragments are often seen in the disease, their presence is neither sensitive nor specific for TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In our experience, it is often a pitfall to rely on the presence or absence of overt end-organ damage or schistocytes.\n\n【23】TTP is characterized by widespread small-vessel platelets and von Willebrand factor-rich thrombi that are the result of a reduction in the activity of the enzyme ADAMTS13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase involved in cleavage of large vWF multimers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (<10%) is very often seen in TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and is caused by an autoantibody (often reported by the lab as an inhibitor) that is commonly detected using a mixing study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The primary treatment of TTP is urgent TPE followed by TPE daily until the platelet count normalizes. Before the discovery of TPE as the treatment, TTP was fatal in 90% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Today, with treatment, about 80–90% of patients survive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Recently, the diagnostic accuracy of the PLASMIC score was validated by a systematic review involving nearly 1,000 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The PLASMIC score ranges from 0–7 and gives one point each for the following: the absence of active cancer, the absence of solid organ and stem cell transplant, and five categories of laboratory results. A PLASMIC score of 5 or greater has a sensitivity of 99 percent and specificity of 57 percent for ADAMTS13 deficiency. Given the potentially life-threatening results of withholding therapy as well as the relative safety of TPE, treatment with urgent TPE is recommended for patients with a score of 5 or higher while awaiting results of ADAMTS13 testing. We hasten to add that the turnaround time of ADAMTS13 testing has dramatically improved recently in many settings due to the wider availability of in-hospital test kits. Thus, guidelines that recommend TPE for patients with a low pretest probability of TTP usually assume that a turnaround time of at least a few days is required for a reference lab to perform the test. This is essentially rendered moot when an in-hospital test can produce a result within 45 minutes to a few hours. In other words, a diagnosis of “can’t rule out TTP” in patient with a low PLASMIC score can very often be ruled out by a rapid in-hospital test (and infusing plasma while waiting, if clinically indicated). Awareness of this innovation should be raised, especially when writing guidelines.\n\n【26】The exact diagnosis (or diagnoses) of our patient is open to debate and speculation. Sequential or concomitant ITP and TTP have been previously described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u> and have been associated with pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>, HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>, and essential thrombocythemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The 2001 review by Baron et al. identified 11 cases of sequential or concurrent ITP and TTP without HIV and demonstrated a female predominance (9/11, 81%) and an association with pregnancy and autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypothyroidism, and Sjogren’s syndrome secondary to RA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Our patient met ACR diagnostic criteria for primary Sjogren’s syndrome (pSS) during his most recent hospitalization. While secondary ITP in patients with pSS may be relatively common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>, secondary TTP in a male patient with pSS is exceedingly rare. The recent review by Carvalho et al. identified 18 patients with SS and TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. pSS was observed in 16/18 (88.9%) with a similar female predominance (15/18, 83%) to patients with both ITP and TTP. In most cases they reviewed, SS preceded TTP. This may fit the timeline of our patient, as he was presumed to have an autoimmune condition at his first presentation that was likely to be pSS and later diagnosed during the subsequent hospitalization.\n\n【28】Due to the increased co-occurrence of both ITP and TTP in patients with autoimmune conditions, HIV, or pregnancy, it has been hypothesized that there may be some shared pathophysiologic factors such as redundancy of the immune system or a mixed immune thrombocytopenia syndrome that connects the two conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 22\\]</u>. A recent article described 19 novel autoantibodies in Sjogren’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> that may further explain the connection between ITP, TTP, and secondary autoimmune conditions.\n\n【29】To our knowledge, this is the first case of sequential ITP and TTP associated with pSS, and it notably occurred in a man. One key lesson is the utility of the PLASMIC score, especially for patients that “do not read the textbook.” It may be very tempting to dismiss a diagnosis of TTP in a patient with ITP or any other condition that can explain isolated thrombocytopenia. More generally, it can also be tempting to dismiss a diagnosis of TTP in a patient who is not in the “usual” demographic for TTP, as TTP is over-represented in females, black females, and most often afflicts such patients who are in their thirties and forties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【30】While the specificity of the PLASMIC score is moderate, the sensitivity is high. High sensitivity tests and scoring systems can be particularly useful when your goal is not to miss a high stakes diagnosis, especially when the therapy is relatively safe. Given TTP’s stakes, urgency, and bespoke treatment, this case underscores the importance of treating empirically with TPE as soon as possible when the PLASMIC score is high—even when one or more patient characteristics or diagnoses tempt you to reconsider.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:37:22", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:37:31", "cost": 9.082}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:37:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:37:20"}

They usually have a pericardial origin.

Introduction\n\n【3】Cystic lesions may occur in the mediastinum; however, they are rare. They can have pericardial, enteric origin or bronchogenic origin in most of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Usually the patients are asymptomatic, and when the lesion leads to symptoms, since it was first reported in 1959 by Meyer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, the standard therapy is the resection of cyst. The literature seldom reveals reports of intrapericardial bronchogenic cysts.\n\n【4】Here, we report clinical presentation and management of a mediastinal bronchogenic cyst in a 27-year-old patient.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】The patient was a 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and swelling of his face and neck when he lay down. He complained of recent faint attacks in the last few weeks. Physical examination, chest radiography, and blood analysis were found to be normal. An echocardiography showed mild diastolic dysfunction and a cysts-like structure inside the pericardial cavity. The computerized tomography (CT) confirmed 8 × 7 cm cystic structure situated between the aortic arch and right pulmonary artery . We decided to surgically remove the mass lesion to treat myocardial diastolic dysfunction and for an accurate histopathologic diagnosis after the consent of the patient.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The computerized tomography of the patient showing 8 × 7 cm cystic structure situated above the right ventricle between the aortic arch and right pulmonary artery.</u>\n\n【8】Following standard median sternotomy, the pericardium was opened and 8 × 7 cm in diameter cystic structure was detected . After mobilizing the cyst from the right atrium, aorta, and the right pulmonary artery, it could be en bloc resected . The cyst was removed from the operating table to another table and cut. Yellow, jelly-like liquid was drained. Specimens for microbiology and histopatologic examination were obtained. A frozen section excluded malignancy and indicated a benign cystic lesion of bronchogenic origin. The cavity left after the removal of the cyst was covered with pericardium and the operation was finished uneventfully.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Perioperative view of the cyst.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Resected cystic lesion.</u>\n\n【11】The patient was taken to the intensive care unit and weaned off mechanic ventilation in 6 hours. He was taken to the ward next day and discharged from the hospital on the postoperative 5th day. Microbiologic examination ended sterile and bronchogenic cyst diagnosis was confirmed with detailed histopathologic examination. The patient is followed regularly for more than 1 year at the outpatient clinic, and he was found to be asymptomatic throughout the followup period.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Bronchogenic cysts are rare congenital lesions. They emerge due to abnormal development of the foregut which develops in a blind-end, fluid-filled pouch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although they are mostly located in the mediastinum, they may also occur in the lungs, diaphragm, retroperitoneum, pericardium, thymus, and neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Within the mediastinum, they are mainly situated at the subcarinal and right paratracheal regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Cases of intrapericardial and intracardiac bronchogenic cysts are very seldom in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Limaïem et al. reported an incidence of 1 case per 42,000 patients in the North American population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Bronchogenic cysts usually do not cause symptoms and patients are mostly detected incidentally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Very rarely, nonspecific symptoms such as retrosternal chest pain, dyspnea, cough, fever, and hoarseness may be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, a huge cyst can provoke arterial compression, compression of the main bronchus and superior vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although adults with cysts are usually symptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, in children they can cause symptoms due to the compression of the adjacent structures. Clinical findings such as cardiac murmur and electrocardiographic changes are described in a few cases in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Bronchogenic cysts are sacs filled with fluid. The radiologic diagnosis may be difficult because of air-fluid level or variable protein content as in case of an infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9\\]</u>. As in our case, computerized tomography aids in preoperative diagnosis; however, differentiation between infections such as hydatid disease, a malignancy, or for the exact origin (i.e. pericardial, enteric, bronchogenic, or others) of the cyst can only be made with resection material and detailed histopathologic examination.\n\n【16】St-Georges et al. analyzed a collection of 86 resections of bronchogenic cysts. Their analysis revealed that 82% (the majority) of the patients became either symptomatic or complicated due to fistulization, ulceration, and infection in time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. McGlynn Jr. et al. reported that the cysts could even imitate an acute coronary syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.

Most commonly, an attentive patient observes such changes early in the course; when missed by the patient, such changes are usually noted by an observant clinician. Clinical diagnosis can be challenging if the patient is on multiple medications because other causes must be excluded. This condition occurs via multiple mechanisms. Frequently, the pigmentary change is reversible with discontinuation of the drug. Causative medications include nonsteroidal; anti-inflammatory agents, antimalarials, antibiotics, psychotropics, amiodarone, and chemotherapeutic agents. The; antimicrobials responsible for hyperpigmentation are antimalarials, tetracyclines, tigecycline, dapsone, rifampicin, and antiretrovirals such as zidovudine. Sunlight exposure can worsen the pigmentation seen with some of the above antimicrobials (e.g. dapsone). Here, we describe an older adult white woman presenting with acute cutaneous; hyperpigmentation of the bilateral lower extremities while on levofloxacin therapy. Hyperpigmentation resolved after cessation of the agent. Our case highlights this unique acute presentation after only a few days of oral levofloxacin.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Fluoroquinolones are a class of antibiotics that belong to the quinolone family of antimicrobial agents. Fluoroquinolones have good oral bioavailability, excellent tolerability, and a broad spectrum of activity. Some fluoroquinolones are not in current clinical use due to their uncommon toxicities. The ones commonly used in clinical practice are ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. They stop bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis via the inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are indicated in the treatment of urinary tract infections. Accordingly, they constitute some of the more commonly prescribed oral antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common adverse effects are reported in the gastrointestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), nervous system (headache, insomnia, mood alterations, hallucinations, and delirium), and connective tissue (tendinitis, retinal detachment, and aortic dissection). Although uncommon, skin reactions typically include rashes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Upon review of the medical literature in PubMed, only four cases of levofloxacin-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>. In most of these cases, the duration of levofloxacin was more than one week, and typically on the order of months. We report a case of bilateral lower extremity hyperpigmentation that occurred in an older white woman with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) after she completed a five-day course of oral levofloxacin for cystitis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 58-year-old white woman presented to the clinic with a hyperpigmented bluish-grey rash over the bilateral lower extremities persistent for two days . Past medical history was significant for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with Stage 5 CKD and hypertension. She was not on any anticoagulation. A few days before this clinic visit, she was treated with oral levofloxacin 750 mg daily for five days (total of 3750 mg) for a urinary tract infection. She denied any recent sick contacts or fever. On further questioning, she admitted to noticing this rash on day three of treatment. She denied any significant sun exposure to her lower extremities. Physical examination revealed a nonblanching bluish-grey rash located on the bilateral lower extremities, especially over the anterolateral aspect involving bilateral feet. Distal pulses were regular. No other significant clinical findings were observed on examination. Her blood work revealed a healthy complete blood cell count with differential. The basic metabolic panel revealed a stable baseline creatinine. She was referred to the dermatology clinic where she underwent skin biopsy of the lesions on her lower extremities. Skin biopsy revealed scattered deposits of brown-black pigment in dermal spindle cells and minimal inflammation, indicating pigmentary rash . High-power magnification displayed coarse brown pigmented cytoplasmic granules within the dermal macrophages . The patients’ medication history revealed no new medication other than the levofloxacin over the last four weeks. The patient had completed antibiotic therapy when she presented to the clinic with hyperpigmentation changes. On follow-up at the clinic three weeks later, the rash seen earlier over the bilateral lower extremities had entirely resolved with no residual changes.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bilateral legs with pigmentary changes.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Low-power magnification shows widely dispersed dermal pigmentation and an epidermis with no significant pathologic changes (20x; hematoxylin and eosin staining).</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Intermediate magnification shows coarse cytoplasmic granular brown pigmentation within aggregates of macrophages surrounding eccrine structures in the dermis (100x; hematoxylin and eosin staining).</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Intermediate magnification shows coarse cytoplasmic granular brown pigmentation within aggregates of macrophages surrounding eccrine structures in the dermis (200x; hematoxylin and eosin staining).</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 High-power magnification displays coarse brown pigmented cytoplasmic granules within the dermal macrophages (400x; hematoxylin and eosin staining).</u>\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Levofloxacin is a well-tolerated medication with good oral bioavailability, making it an optimal choice as an oral antibiotic. Levofloxacin is associated with dermatologic adverse effects in less than 3% of instances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common presentation is an unspecified rash. With a treatment duration of five days or fewer, such a rash is infrequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Uncommonly, it can cause a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, phototoxicity, Stevens—Johnson syndrome, fixed drug eruption, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It can cause hyperpigmentation, albeit rarely. A small but significant fraction (10% to 20%) of acquired pigmentation cases are drug-induced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Minocycline is the most common antibiotic responsible for drug-induced hyperpigmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. In a few isolated cases, polymyxin and tigecycline have caused this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Among the quinolones, few cases have been reported, and all were due to pefloxacin and levofloxacin. The levofloxacin tablet coating contains small quantities of iron oxide and hydroxide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The mechanisms responsible for this hyperpigmentation include drug metabolite deposits, precipitation of intracellular iron chelate complexes within macrophages, and increased intracellular melanin production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6, 8\\]</u>. A review of the medical literature via PubMed revealed only four reported cases of levofloxacin-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation—all confirmed by biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>. On review of these cases, three patients were on oral levofloxacin therapy for more than four weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 5\\]</u>. One case report mentioned the use of levofloxacin for only eleven days. This patient had significant exposure to sunlight with phototoxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. None of the four case reports mentioned any significant CKD. In our patient, the pigmentary changes on the lower extremities were seen on the third day of the five day therapeutic regimen. She received a higher dose of levofloxacin (a total of 3750 mg) based on her renal function. Levofloxacin and its metabolites are renally excreted. A higher dose in a patient with unhealthy renal function results in the accumulation of the drug and its metabolites. Her prior Stage 5 CKD predisposed her to a higher risk of developing adverse effects. The standard levofloxacin dose in Stage 5 CKD is a 500 mg bolus dose followed by 250 mg every 48 hours over five days (for a total of 1000 mg). Based on the renal calculation of the dose, our patient received a total of 31 days’ worth of levofloxacin over five days. Thus, our Stage 5 CKD patient received a significantly higher dose of levofloxacin (3750 mg instead of 1000 mg for five days), resulting in the accumulation of the drug and its metabolites. The rash resolved completely in three weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Discontinuation of the offending medication is currently the only therapeutic modality for levofloxacin-induced hyperpigmentation. Pigmentary changes in all the case reports resolved following the discontinuation of levofloxacin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>.\n\n【13】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【14】We report an unusual adverse effect of levofloxacin in a CKD patient. This case report stresses the importance of dose adjustments of renally excreted medications in the CKD population. Also, CKD patients may present with pigmentary changes earlier than a typical patient due to supratherapeutic drug levels. While such changes are reversible by discontinuation of the drug, in such instances, a new regimen based on the antibiogram must then be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:48:34", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:50:41", "cost": 127.938}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:50:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:48:33"}

Case Report\n\n【5】A 33-year-old Chinese female presented with pain in the neck, back, and shoulders as a result of a motor vehicle accident. On examination, there was tenderness and hypertonicity in the paraspinal muscles in the cervical area, paraspinal muscles in the lumbar area, and trapezius muscles. Incidentally, a salmon patch was noted on the forehead and the glabellum . The patch was faintly erythematous in color. There were no other salmon patches noted on any parts of her body. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. In particular, she did not have dysmorphic features or hepatomegaly.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | A faint erythematous patch noted on the forehead and glabellum of a 33-year-old patient. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】According to the patient, the patch was present at birth but was erythematous in color. She did not have similar erythematous patches elsewhere such as the eyelids, nose, philtrum, lips, and the occipital areas. She recalled that the patch would deepen in color with crying and vigorous activity. The color of the patch had become lighter over time. She was born to a gravida 3, para 2, 24-year-old mother at term following a normal vaginal delivery and an uncomplicated pregnancy. The mother was not on any medication or alcohol during the pregnancy. The parents were nonconsanguineous. No family members had similar skin lesions in adulthood.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Clinically, the lesions of salmon patches are scarlet to pink, flat, can be totally blanched, and usually deepen in color with vigorous activity, crying, straining with defecation, breath-holding, or changes in ambient temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In white infants, they are usually bright red or pink and are darker in oriental or black infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The lesions are most commonly found on the nape, followed by the glabella and eyelids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Other less common sites are the nasolabial folds, lips, and sacral area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Salmon patches are usually symmetric, with lesions on both eyelids or on both sides of midline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Prominent lesions in the glabella are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7\\]</u>. Salmon patches are generally not associated with extracutaneous anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In spite of their midline location, most salmon patches, except those in the sacral area, are not associated with spinal dysraphism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Salmon patches should be differentiated from port-wine stain (nevus flammeus) and congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Port-wine stain is a capillary malformation characterized clinically by persistent macular erythema and pathologically by ectasia of the papillary and superficial reticular dermal capillaries, which are otherwise lined by normal-appearing flat endothelial cells. The lesions of port-wine stain are usually unilateral and segmental and do not follow the lines of Blaschko. The lesions often become dark-red during adolescence and violaceous with advancing age. Although port-wine stain can occur anywhere on the body, the most common site is the face. The lesions grow with the child and persist throughout life. Although usually an isolated finding, port-wine stain is also a typical feature of Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.\n\n【11】Congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation simulates a salmon patch but differs from a salmon patch in that the lesion is more extensive, extending from the forehead and glabella to the nose, philtrum, and upper lip; the color is more intense; and the lesion fades more slowly or incompletely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Familial cases of congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformations have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Our patient did not have similar erythematous patches elsewhere such as the eyelids, nose, philtrum, and lips at birth. As such, in a strict sense, she did not have a congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation. Some investigators, however, believe that salmon patches on the forehead and the glabellum may be a forme fruste of congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation.\n\n【12】Salmon patches tend to fade and disappear with time; nuchal lesions tend to persist longer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10, 11\\]</u>. Leung and Telmesani examined 808 Caucasian newborn term infants (440 males and 368 females) and 1,575 Caucasian children for the presence of salmon patches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The patches were present in 192 (43.6%) males and 161 (43.8%) females in the neonatal period. The most frequent site was the nape, followed by the glabellum, eyelids, nose, and upper lip. Salmon patches were not detected in boys after age 6 and in girls after age 5. On the other hand, Oster and Nielson detected nuchal salmon patches in 501 (46.2%) of 1,084 Danish school-aged girls and 382 (35.1%) of 1,087 Danish school-aged boys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Corson found nuchal salmon patches in 13 (4.7%) of 275 medical students 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Verbov and Steinberg examined 188 hospital inpatients and old-aged residents (67 males and 121 females), aged 60 years and over, for the presence and absence of a salmon patch over the occiput and nape 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Forty (60%) of the males and 51 (42%) of the females showed typical nuchal patches. From these studies, it seems clear that salmon patches are common in the neonatal period. These patches, except those located in the occiput and nape, tend to disappear or significantly regress with time. Those in the occiput and nape tend to persist longer. Facial lesions are rare after puberty and have not been reported in adulthood. We herein report the occurrence of a salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum of a Chinese adult. With the reporting of this case, it is hoped that similar cases will be forthcoming. Familiarity of the existence of salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum in adulthood would allow a straight forward diagnosis to be made and unnecessary referrals to be avoided.\n\n【13】The persistent salmon patch on the face of an adult is benign and not associated with any neurocutaneous syndrome or underlying vascular abnormality.

If a small amount of bile juice was detected, meticulous observation not only around the cystic duct stump but also the gallbladder fossa should be performed. Simultaneous laparoscopic suturing was feasible, and an ideal procedure against SVBD injury developed during LC.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Bile duct injury is one of the most severe complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. According to a recent report, the incidence of bile duct injury during LC is approximately 0.5% or less 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Subvesical bile duct (SVBD) injury is a secondary major cause of minor bile duct injury, while leakage from the cystic duct stump is the most frequent injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. SVBD is a rare anatomical structure which runs in contact with the gallbladder fossa and has a prevalence of 4% or more 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. SVBD is classified into four types: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> segmental or sectional SVBD, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> accessory SVBD, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> hepaticocholecystic bile duct, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> aberrant SVBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】SVBD injuries are often missed intraoperatively because of their small diameter and a lack of the surgeon’s understanding. As a result, SVBD injuries are usually detected postoperatively and mainly treated endoscopically, while some severe cases require reoperation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Herein, we show two cases of SVBD injury detected and repaired simultaneously during LC.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】Case 1. The patient was an 84-year-old female, preoperatively diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. She had a history of undergoing distal gastrectomy with Billroth I reconstruction. On the 3rd day from onset of acute cholecystitis, she underwent LC. Because of the presence of scarring tissue, fundus-down approach was performed. After dissection of the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa, a small amount of bile leakage was detected at the fundus side of the gallbladder fossa . By scrutinizing laparoscopically, a tiny hole from which bile juice was oozing was confirmed, and we made a diagnosis of SVBD injury . After changing the 5-mm port at the epigastric fossa to a 10-mm port, suturing of the injured SVBD was performed laparoscopically using 3-0 prolene, and the bile leakage was stopped . A closed-suction drain was placed at the subhepatic space. A slight bile leak was detected from the drain on the 1st postoperative day, but it was settled spontaneously on the 2nd postoperative day, and the drain was removed on the 3rd postoperative day. The patient complained of appetite loss, and she was discharged on the 10th postoperative day.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 After dissection of the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa, a small amount of bile leakage was detected in the gallbladder fossa (a).

After suturing, the bile leakage stopped (d).</u>\n\n【8】Case 2. The patient was an 81-year-old male, preoperatively diagnosed with cholelithiasis. Because of a previous history of undergoing distal gastrectomy with Billroth I reconstruction, laparoscopic adhesiolysis around the gallbladder was performed followed by cholecystectomy. During adhesiolysis around the gallbladder, a small amount of bile leakage occurred from the surface of the liver adjacent to the gallbladder fossa . After dissection of the gallbladder, the presence of SVBD injury at the surface of the liver was confirmed laparoscopically . Suturing of the injured SVBD was performed laparoscopically, and the bile leakage was stopped . A closed-suction drain was placed in the subhepatic space. Postoperative bile leakage was not detected, and the drain was removed on the 2nd postoperative day. He was discharged without complications on the 4th postoperative day.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 A small amount of bile leakage occurred from the surface of the liver adjacent to the gallbladder fossa (a).

After suturing, the bile leakage stopped (d).</u>\n\n【10】In Case 1 and Case 2, preoperative CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) images did not indicate the presence of SBVD. In addition, in each case, appearance of the liver was almost normal, without findings of cirrhosis or atrophy. The locations of the injured SVBD are indicated in Figures 3(a) and 3(b), respectively.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Each circle indicates the location of the injured SVBD in Case 1 (a) and Case 2 (b).</u>\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】We presented two cases of SVBD injury detected and repaired intraoperatively during LC. SVBD injuries are usually detected and diagnosed postoperatively, and intraoperative detection of them is considered rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. The difficulty in intraoperative detection may be derived from the small diameter of the SVBD, decreased bile flow during general anesthesia, and/or the lack of the surgeon’s understanding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Only a few cases of SVBD injury detected and treated intraoperatively have been reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 8\\]</u>. Regarding preoperative detection, when reviewing the preoperative MRCP images, we could not recognize the presence of the SVBD in either of the two cases. Although drip-infusion cholangiography CT is thought to have higher sensitivity for detecting the SVBD than MRCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>, this technique was not performed on our cases. In our cases, meticulous observation around the gallbladder fossa using the laparoscopic imaging system allowed us to successfully detect SVBD injury intraoperatively. Surgeons should consider the presence of SVBD injury if a small amount of bile juice is detected after resection of the gallbladder and should perform meticulous observation not only around the stump of the cystic duct but also around the gallbladder fossa. A recent report advocated the usefulness of intraoperative fluorescent cholangiography for intraoperative detection of the SVBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【14】According to the classification of the SVBD reported by Shnelldorfer et al. Case 1 is classified as a hepaticocholecystic bile duct, while Case 2 is an accessory SVBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In Case 1, dissection of the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa was performed bluntly along the outer side of the subserosal layer because of the presence of the scarring tissue around the fundus side of the gallbladder. The diameter of the injured SVBD was only approximately 2 mm. It seemed that if the dissection was performed using an ultrasonic dissector along the subserosal layer, the SVBD might be sealed without the development of a bile leak. In Case 2, the SVBD injury was developed during adhesiolysis around the gallbladder fossa. This injury was derived from the misperception of the accurate layer for adhesiolysis and cutting into the liver surface adjacent to the gallbladder fossa. We advocate that surgeons should keep in mind that blunt dissection of the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa along the outer layer of the subserosal layer or cutting into the liver surface adjacent to the gallbladder fossa implies risk for developing SVBD injury.\n\n【15】In addition, our cases demonstrated that simultaneous laparoscopic repair by suturing is a feasible procedure for SVBD injury. According to recently reported cases, SVBD injuries are usually detected postoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–16\\]</u>. As a result, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography is usually considered a choice of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, while there are several cases requiring reoperation including relaparoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. According to previous reports, suturing or clipping of the leak site is usually performed during reoperation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Since delayed detection may cause severe conditions including peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, intraoperative detection and simultaneous repair is considered an ideal treatment for SVBD injury. On the other hand, there are some limitations regarding laparoscopic suturing. At first, laparoscopic suturing is a skilled procedure and should be performed in expert hands. Second, an excess stitch may result in a development of another injury. Therefore, surgeons should perform intraoperative cholangiography or consider conversion to laparotomy before suturing in the case with a high risk of another injury.\n\n【16】#### 4\\.

Introduction\n\n【3】Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH) is a rare, low- to intermediate-grade tumor of endothelial origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> with around 120 cases reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. At the onset, the patients are usually asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms (such as weight loss, fatigue, dyspnoea, cough, and chest pain). Chest imaging usually shows the presence of multiple, bilateral small pulmonary lesions. The diagnosis usually requires a lung biopsy. The treatment is still not standardized. Surgery is suggested in presence of a solitary nodule or few unilateral nodules. Instead if the lesions are unresectable or multiple and bilateral several chemotherapy protocols have been used. The prognosis is variable with a median survival of 4-5 years.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 67-year-old Caucasian man, lifelong nonsmoker, with no prior history of lung diseases, was referred to our university hospital for the presence, in the last 3 months, of exertion dyspnoea (grade 1 according to the Medical Research Council scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>) and dry cough. He had worked as an employee without occupational exposures of clinical relevance. His past medical history was characterized by an herniated lumbar disc, systemic arterial hypertension (treated with calcium blockers), diabetes mellitus (treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents), and polycythemia vera (diagnosed in 2007 and treated from 2008 with hydroxyurea). Physical examination was unremarkable. Arterial blood gases analysis performed with the patient breathing room air demonstrated normal values (pH 7.40, PaCO<sub>2</sub> 43 mmHg, PaO<sub>2</sub> 91 mmHg, and bicarbonate level 26 mmoL/L). Routine laboratory tests were within the normal range except for those listed in Table 1. Serum levels of neoplastic markers were within normal range, including carcinoembryonic antigen (2.7 ng/mL), prostate-specific antigen (3.75 ng/mL), and CA19.9 (15 U/mL). Also the serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (11 IU/mL) and β<sub>2</sub> microglobulin (2.50 mg/mL) were within normal limits.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory tests concerning diabetes mellitus and polycythemia vera.</u>\n\n【7】The pulmonary function tests showed the presence of a restrictive pattern with a vital capacity (VC) of 3.14 litres (70% of the predicted value), a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.11 litres (72% of the predicted value), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 2.55 litres (76.5% of predicted value), a FEV<sub>1</sub>/VC ratio of 81% (108% of the predicted value) and a total lung capacity (TLC), 5.35 litres (73.3% of the predicted value). DLCO was in the normal range .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Flow volume loop. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】The chest radiography and a computed tomography of the chest (performed with iodine intravenous contrast medium) showed the presence of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules (with a diameter variable between 3 mm and 3 cm) without contrast enhancement and the presence of one nodule (with the diameter of 2 cm) in the fourth hepatic segment showing late-phase contrast enhancement and another in the spleen (with the diameter of 1 cm) with cystic features .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | The chest radiography (a, b) and a computed tomography of the chest (performed with iodine intravenous contrast medium) (c, d) showed the presence of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】Interestingly, at the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), all these nodules were not showing any uptake of the tracer .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, all these nodules were not showing any uptake of the tracer. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【13】The fiberoptic bronchoscopy was normal. A transbronchial lung biopsy and an ultrasound-guided transthoracic lung biopsy were both nondiagnostic.\n\n【14】The final diagnosis of pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma was made by pulmonary wedge resection of a nodule located in the left lower lobe by video-thoracoscopic surgery. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue revealed round- to oval-shaped nodules, with a central sclerotic, hypocellular zone, and peripheral zone rich of cells. There was tumour diffusion into the adjacent bronchioles and the alveolar spaces with micropolypoid aspects. The extracellular stroma consisted of an abundant matrix of chondroid, hyaline, mucinous, or myxomatous appearance.\n\n【15】The neoplastic cells were of polygonal shape and eosinophilic with round nuclei and uniform small to moderately sized nucleoli. Some cells had cytoplasmic vacuoles.\n\n【16】Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the neoplastic cells are endothelial cells immunoreactive for Von Willebrand factor, CD31, CD34, and vimentin .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | (a) Neoplastic nodule showing increased number of cells at the periphery with an eosinophilic stroma (H/E, 100x magnification).

Discussion\n\n【20】Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH) is a rare, low- to intermediate-grade tumor of endothelial origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma can arise from many organs, including lungs, liver, bone, and soft tissue, simultaneously or sequentially. When this occurs, it may be difficult to determinate if the tumor is multicentric from the beginning or there is a primary lesion with metastases to the other tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Around 120 cases have been reported in literature 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[2, Table 2\\]</u>, only five of them were in Italian patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 15–18\\]</u>. Mean (SD) age of patients is 40.1 (17.5) years, and 73% are females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Interestingly, our patient is instead a 67-year-old male. Most patients are asymptomatic at presentation, and some are complaining of weight loss, fatigue, dyspnoea, fever, pleuritic chest pain, mild nonproductive cough, and haemoptysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In most cases, the physical examination is normal, but few cases of digital clubbing and pleural effusions have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Review of the clinical, radiological and pathological features of the published cases of primary pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.</u>\n\n【22】The most characteristic feature of PEH on chest radiographs or CT is the presence of multiple perivascular nodules with well- or ill-defined margins in both lungs. The nodules may range in size up to 2 cm, but most of them are ≤1 cm in diameter; they are usually found near medium-sized vessels and bronchi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This radiological presentation is suggestive of many lung diseases .\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 Differential diagnosis of multiple pulmonary bilateral nodules.</u>\n\n【24】Some authors consider 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography an important tool for PEH diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>; however, in our patient, the PET was negative, suggesting that a negative PET cannot exclude PEH. Unfortunately, we do not have a molecular explanation for this finding but may be related to a low proliferation rate of the neoplastic cells.\n\n【25】The diagnosis of PEH is made on the basis of the histopathological features and confirmed using immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cell markers, such as against factor VIII-related von Willebrand antigen, CD31 or CD34 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 13, 20, 21\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The prognosis is variable. The 5-year survival is around 60% (range 47–71%). In fact, there are two groups of PEH at the clinical presentation: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> one asymptomatic, with a solitary pulmonary nodule or unilateral multiple nodules. Usually they can be managed with surgery alone, and lymphatic invasion is unlikely. Their prognosis is good with a median survival of more than 10 years; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> another symptomatic group presents with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules or pleural effusion with scarce response to chemotherapy. The prognosis of this group is poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Most patients die from pulmonary insufficiency as a result of an increasing number of tumor nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Hematogeneous metastases are rare and have been described especially in the liver but also in other sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The treatment of PEH is not standardized. Surgery alone is indicated in the presence of a single pulmonary nodule or unilateral multiple nodules. Lung transplantation should be considered in patients with vascular infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Various chemotherapies have been reported for unresectable or metastatic PEH, with variable effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Other authors have suggested a role for the hormonal therapy (antiestrogens and progesterone) in patients with diffuse disease if the neoplastic cells express estrogen and progesterone receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. A slight regression of the pulmonary lesions was also obtained with interferon (IFN)-2α, probably for its antiangiogenic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Thalidomide and IFN-α have also been proposed for unresectable cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Some beneficial results were also obtained with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks human VEGF-A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 25\\]</u>. The neoplastic cells express glucocorticoid receptors and the enzyme 11β\\-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase involved in the synthesis of the steroids, suggesting a potential role for steroid modulators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【29】In conclusion, we had the opportunity to observe an unusual primary pulmonary hemangioepithelioma in an old male patient, and interestingly, in comparison with the published literature, the neoplastic lesions were PET negative. Again, as previously suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>, we stress the importance of starting an international clinical registry of this unusual neoplasm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:26", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:48", "cost": 21.294}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:26"}

Introduction\n\n【3】According to previous reports, the entity of pituitary (sellar or parasellar) lymphoma includes primary pituitary lymphoma (PPL) and secondary pituitary lymphoma (SPL). SPL includes the involvement of systemic lymphoma. Both of these lymphomas are extremely rare. Nineteen cases of PPL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–17\\]</u> and 16 cases of SPL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 18–30\\]</u> have been reported. We describe a patient with SPL treated with chemotherapy following transnasal biopsy and showing a good prognosis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Description\n\n【5】A 78-year-old woman with no remarkable medical history presented with diplopia, left ptosis, and back pain that has persisted for over one month. Her ocular motility improved spontaneously, but 3 months later, fever, polyuria, and polydipsia appeared. Her body temperature rose to between 38° and 39°C every night. Her urinary volume was 4-5 L/day. There was no weight loss or neurological abnormality. So she went to general hospital and performed brain and thoracic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. These images showed double lesion at sellar region and Th3 vertebral body. Then, she was admitted to our hospital.\n\n【6】Laboratory studies showed anemia and a slight elevation of the serum levels of inflammatory markers. Hemoglobin was 10.3 g/dL (normal, 12.0–16.0). C-reactive protein (CRP) was 4.09 g/mL (normal, <5 mg/dL), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 20 mm/hr (normal, <3–15 mm/hr). The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was also high at 535 U/I (normal, 124.0–232.0). The patient’s basal levels of anterior pituitary hormones were almost within normal range. Diabetes insipidus was suspected based on the clinical findings. The markers of infections, such as HIV, HBV, and HCV, were all negative. The level of serum interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was examined because of detected multiple lesions, and it increased to 7526 U/mL (normal, 190–650).\n\n【7】MR imaging of the brain revealed an intra- and parasellar mass lesion extending to the upper clivus, sphenoid sinus, and right cavernous sinus. The intrasellar mass compressed the pituitary gland to the dorsal side. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted images, iso- to hypointense on T2-weighted images, and inhomogeneously enhancing after contrast injection . No other brain lesion was found. Thoracic MR imaging revealed a mass lesion with compression fracture of the Th3 vertebral body. It was isointense on T1- and T2-weighted images and homogeneously enhancing . Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging showed abnormal accumulations in the parasellar lesion and the C6 and Th3 vertebrae. Another workup had been done in a different hospital 2 weeks before the patient’s admission at our facility, including computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis and bone scintigraphy; these were all negative. The preoperative differential diagnosis was metastatic tumor, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, or skull base sarcoma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a)–(f): Sagittal and coronal T1- ((a), (d)), T2- ((b), (e)), and Gd-enhanced T1-weighted ((c), (f)) MRI of the brain show a parasellar mass lesion.

(g) Sagittal Gd-enhanced thoracic MRI (lower right) shows a mass lesion with compression fracture of the Th3 vertebral body. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】We performed an endoscopic endonasal biopsy. The histological examination revealed hyperplastic tumor cells with a high mitotic index. Immunohistochemically, CD20 (a B-cell marker) was positive, CD3 (a T-cell marker) was negative, and the MIB-1 index was 100%. These findings were consistent with a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The bone marrow aspiration revealed positive lymphoma cells. A lumbar puncture showed no tumor cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. Another CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was performed, confirming the presence of hepatosplenomegaly, which seemed to be the consequence of infiltration of the tumor cells. Based on the results of the bone marrow aspiration and CT findings, this patient was diagnosed as having SPL.\n\n【10】Postoperatively, the patient underwent five courses of chemotherapy with the R-THP-CVP regimen (rituximab, pirarubicin, doxorubicin, hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide hydrate, vindesine sulfate, and prednisolone). It took three weeks for one course of chemotherapy. After this chemotherapy, the follow-up MR imaging demonstrated a significant interval decrease in the size of the suprasellar and vertebral masses . Bone marrow aspiration revealed no infiltration. The serum levels of LDH and sIL-2R were decreased (LDH 156, sIL-2R 1063). She was discharged from our hospital after 4 months from operation. After discharge from our hospital, she received one more course of chemotherapy in another hospital. The patient no longer presented with fever. Her diabetes insipidus is well controlled with DDAVP. MR imaging showed complete remission and no signs of recurrence at 4 years after the operation.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Sagittal Gd-enhanced brain MRI after 5-course chemotherapy shows complete disappearance of the tumor. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】To our knowledge, only 19 cases of PPL and 16 cases of SPL have been reported. In these reports, several examinations including whole-body CT, gastrofiberscopy, bone marrow aspiration, and lumbar puncture were recommended to rule out another systemic lesion when a patient has PPL or SPL. This process is also important to differentiate between PPL and SPL. The clinical and radiological features of reported PPL and SPL are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The mean age of the patients with PPL and SPL is almost the same. Male preponderance is apparent in the reported patients with PPL or SPL. Histologically, monoclonal B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas are the majority of PPLs and SPLs, similar to primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 10\\]</u>. There is little difference in clinical presentation between PPL and SPL. Although the most common presentation is a pituitary insufficiency in both of these lymphomas, hypopituitarism is seen more often in PPL (73.7%) than SPL (41.2%), but there is no statistically significant difference. On the other hand, the frequency of diabetes insipidus is the same in both patient populations (PPL 36.8%, SPL 47.0%). Symptoms of fever, night sweat, and weight loss are more common in SPL (58.8%) than PPL (42.1%). These are the factors of unfavorable prognosis in CNS lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, patients with SPL tend to have longer overall survival than patients with PPL.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Clinical summary of 19 patients with PPL.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Clinical summary of 17 patients with SPL.</u>\n\n【16】Unfortunately, regardless of PPL or SPL, the differential diagnosis is usually difficult, although prompt diagnosis and the initiation of treatment are crucial to achieve better clinical prognoses in patients with malignant lymphomas. The characteristic findings in MR imaging of pituitary lymphomas are isointense on T1-weighted images and iso- to hypointense on T2-weighted images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 8, 31\\]</u> and homogeneous enhancement after Gd administration. Hyperintensity on diffusion weighted images is also typical, which reflects the hypercellular density of these tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, these radiological findings are not specific for pituitary lymphoma.\n\n【17】Aside from radiological findings, it is well known that the levels of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) are elevated in patients with malignant lymphoma. However, there is only one reported case of systemic pituitary lymphoma in which the sIL-2R level was measured and elevated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. In our patient, the sIL-2R level was remarkably elevated, and it reminded us of a pituitary lymphoma. Of course, elevated sIL-2R is not a specific finding of malignant lymphoma; sIL-2R is also elevated in cases of autoimmune (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and other malignant diseases. Further, sIL-2R does not elevate in all cases of malignant lymphoma. Despite these limitations, elevated sIL-2R in a patient with a pituitary lesion can be a clue to the diagnosis of this rare disease. Although transsphenoidal biopsy is necessary in most cases to diagnose a pituitary lymphoma, these radiological and serological findings can contribute to a prompt diagnosis and induction of therapy.\n\n【18】For the treatment of primary CNS lymphomas, chemotherapy with the combined use of　a cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) regimen, methotrexate (MTx), and/or rituximab has been commonly performed, but over the past decade, high-dose MTx therapy has become more common because of its penetrative tendency through the blood-brain barrier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, there are multiple reported cases treated with MTx (including intrathecal MTx), and the SPL patients did not have good outcome regardless of MTx treatment. Thus, it is also important to differentiate PPL from SPL when choosing a chemotherapy regimen. In the present SPL case, high-dose MTx was avoided, and a modified CHOP regimen and rituximab (R-THP-CVP) were used. With this chemotherapy, complete remission was achieved and no recurrence was detected at 47 months after the initial diagnosis.\n\n【19】In conclusion, we have described a case of SPL which was successfully treated with chemotherapy. Transsphenoidal biopsy was required because the differential diagnosis was difficult based on only radiological and clinical findings. However, T2 hypointensity in MR imaging and an elevated sIL-2R level can be useful to diagnose this disease, although these findings are not always specific. Neurosurgeons should be aware of this rare disease in the differential diagnosis of sellar lesion, because prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to achieve better clinical outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:55:42", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:56:31", "cost": 49.017}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:56:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:55:42"}

Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy was performed, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed Ki-67 and p53 mutations to be negative in this case. Signet ring gastric cancer has long been thought to confer a worse prognosis than other forms of gastric cancer; however, our case did not progress to advanced gastric cancer for 15 months.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Signet ring cell gastric cancer (SRGC) is a histologic diagnosis based on microscopic characteristics as described by the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. SRGC cells are characterized by abundant intracytoplasmic mucins, ample and clear cytoplasm, and eccentrically located nuclei compressed by intracytoplasmic mucins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The clinicopathological characteristics of SRGC are known to differ from other types of gastric cancer. Some reports have suggested a higher rate of formation of multiple gastric cancers if the primary lesion is SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In general, SRGC is believed to behave more aggressively and have a worse prognosis than other forms of gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>; however, recent studies from Asia have demonstrated that when adjusted for stage, this might not be the case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Early SRGC does not demonstrate more frequent lymph node (LN) metastases than other types of gastric cancer; improved survival has been reported for early stages of SRGC compared with other types of gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, but relatively worse survival in later stages of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Once early SRGC evolves into advanced gastric cancer, the diffusely infiltrating characteristics of SRGC may involve the entire stomach, resulting in what is known as linitis plastica, which is associated with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thus, the idea that signet ring cell histology conveys a worse prognosis might not always be correct.\n\n【5】Here, we report a rare case of SRGC in a male patient whose flat pale mucosal lesion was endoscopically unchanged 15 months after the initial endoscopic examination, when he was diagnosed with intramucosal SRGC.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 58-year-old man who had suffered from appetite loss underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) during a medical check-up in October 2011. A flat, pale, mucosal lesion (5 mm in diameter; Figure 1(a)) on the posterior wall of the distal gastric body was observed. Chromoendoscopy with indigo-carmine dye added to acetic acid did not show any staining indicating gastric neoplasia, so we planned to repeat EGD 1 year later. The herbal medicine rikkunshito was administered for 4 weeks, and the patient’s appetite gradually improved. The next EGD to which the patient consented, taken in January 2013, revealed the flat, pale, mucosal lesion to be the same size as it had been in October 2011 ; it was not enhanced by indigo-carmine dye staining added to acetic acid . Additionally, image-enhanced EGD using the narrow-band light method did not reveal any findings of significance (data not shown). At this time, we took a biopsy to pathologically diagnose and characterize this gastric lesion, which allowed diagnosis of SRGC . The endoscopic diagnosis was Type 0-IIb in accordance with the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma (JCGC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, which is a manual that describes the classification of cancer according to its stage and histology, classifies its curability via surgery and the extent of lymphadenectomy, and evaluates responses to chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Computed tomography (CT) showed fluffing surrounding the gastric body and no distinct regional LN or distant metastases . The fluffing indicated inflammatory changes suspected to be serosal invasion from the gastric tumor. Laboratory results were within normal limits and the serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal. We diagnosed this lesion as clinical(c) T1(M), cN0, cM0, and cStage IA according to the JCGC. The CT finding of inflammatory changes surrounding the gastric body suggested a risk of serosal invasion, so laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy was performed rather than endoscopic resection. The regional lymph nodes (LN stations 1, 3, 4d, 5, 6, 7, 8a, 9, and 12a) were resected. The surgical specimen revealed signet ring cells alone, limited to the mucosa without lymphovascular involvement or ulcerative findings . The lesion was 5 mm in diameter, and the resection margin was free of tumor cells. Portions of the resected regional LNs did not include metastatic cancer cells.

Discussion\n\n【13】Early SRGC tends to be superficial and large, so it is usually diagnosed earlier than gastric cancer of other histological types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. At the first endoscopy (October 2011), we could detect a small, flat, pale mucosa in the stomach. Chromoendoscopy with indigo-carmine dye added to acetic acid improves the detection rates of early gastric cancer and precancerous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In this case, indigo-carmine dye added to acetic acid staining did not show any signs indicating gastric neoplasia, so we did not take any biopsies in the initial EGD. Therefore, it is unknown whether signet ring cells had been histologically localized in this gastric lesion in the initial EGD. The next endoscopic images taken in January 2013 showed that the lesion was unaltered in size and shape; satellite lesions were not seen, and biopsy was carried out at this time. Unexpectedly, the biopsy revealed SRGC histology. It is unknown whether SRGC usually arises from a preexisting precancerous lesion or as a so-called de novo carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Conventional endoscopy and chromoendoscopy did not show any alterations in size or shape of this gastric lesion for 15 months between the first and second examinations, and this tumor showed only signet ring cells without accompanying adenoma or other types of cancer cells. Thus, there was a low possibility that a preexistent precancerous lesion had turned into SRGC in the intramucosal layer between the first and second examinations; therefore, it is likely that signet ring cells might have been localized in this gastric lesion in the initial EGD.\n\n【14】In general, Ki-67 and p53 are highly expressed in SRGC cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Ki-67 is an antigen that corresponds to a nuclear nonhistone protein expressed by cells in the proliferative phases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Ki-67 labeling is relatively low in normal gastric epithelium (<15%), while Ki-67 labeling of primary SRGC is high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. p53 is a nuclear protein thought to be involved in the control of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and maintenance of genomic stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The immunohistochemical demonstration of p53 highly suggests a p53 gene mutation and malignant potential of tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. While normal epithelium never expresses p53, p53 is highly expressed in SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The expression levels of Ki-67 and p53 in early SRGCs are still unknown. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Ki-67 and p53 mutations to be negative in this case, which might be the reason why it had not progressed to advanced gastric cancer for 15 months.\n\n【15】Recently, endoscopic submucosal dissection has been carefully applied in early SRGCs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, there are no specific guidelines for the endoscopic treatment of SRGCs. The differences in outcomes between early- and late-stage SRGC described above could reflect the aggressive resection strategies. Furthermore, it must be emphasized that forming satellite lesions is another characteristic of SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, for which extending endoscopic resection criteria is inappropriate. On the other hand, because there have been some reports that early SRGC carries a lower rate of LN metastasis, which is specifically related to recurrence of gastric cancer including SRGC, and better prognosis compared with advanced SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, it is possible that endoscopic resection can be performed on patients with small SRGC limited to the mucosa and with no LN metastasis or satellite lesions. CT indicated that there was a risk of serosal invasion of the gastric body, so we judged that laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy, rather than endoscopic resection, was the most suitable treatment option to resect this gastric tumor completely. If serosal invasion had not been suspected, it might have been appropriate to treat this case with endoscopic resection such as endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection. The surveillance of LN metastasis in addition to other organs and the residual stomach for primary SRGC is particularly important after endoscopic resection or surgery. Moreover, both endoscopic follow-up and biopsy are necessary to find SRGCs at early stages before diffuse infiltration can occur.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:42:03", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:42:11", "cost": 8.789}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:42:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:42:02"}

Hereditary AT deficiency is frequently caused by mutations in SERPINC1 gene. It is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Homozygous pathogenic mutations in this gene are extremely rare. We present a case of a 7-year-old female who presented at age of 4 years with massive cerebral sinus venous thrombosis. Thrombophilia workup showed a low AT level of 30%. Targeted genetic sequencing of SERPINC1 revealed a novel pathogenic homozygous mutation c.1320C>G p. (Phe440Leu). The patient was managed initially with unfractionated heparin with AT replacement using fresh frozen plasma and was later switched to only low-molecular-weight heparin. There was no recurrence or new thrombosis with 3 years of follow-up.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Antithrombin (antithrombin III, AT) deficiency is a thrombophilia disorder. AT is a significant plasmatic inhibitor for activated coagulation factors such as thrombin (factor IIa), factor Xa, and factor IXa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. AT protein is encoded by the SERPINC1 (serpin family C member 1) gene. SERPINC1 is located on chromosome 1q25.1 and contains seven exons and six introns. The structure of SERPINC1 gene and protein is shown in Figure 1. Hereditary AT deficiency is usually caused by single-point mutations in SERPINC1. It is associated with an about 20-fold increase in the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Several mutations and genetic alterations have been recognized in this gene which is relatively rare (1 in 2000–3000 individuals) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. According to ClinVar on the NIH website 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, there are 300 different SERPINC1 mutations causing AT deficiency. Most of the mutations that have been described in the SERPINC1 are heterozygous, which are inherited as autosomal dominant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Homozygosity is extremely rare and may not be compatible with life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, a few patients who harbour homozygous mutations were reported and had severe thromboembolic events early in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In most AT deficiency, patients showed a decrease in AT plasmatic level to less than 50% (normal range, 80–120%).\n\n【4】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The SERPINC1 gene and protein domain structures. The figure showed gene ID 462 SERPINC1 as well as merged features of NP\\000479.1 and NM\\000488.3 with 1357 kb. The SERPINC1 gene shown by a heavy horizontal arrow line represents genomic DNA. Exons are shown as vertical green bars and numbered from 1 to 7. The amino acids encoded by each exon are indicated below the vertical green bars and are numbered from 1 to 464. The SERPINC1 protein structure showed two main domains: the NH<sub>2</sub>\\-terminal heparin-binding domain encoded by exon 2 and a COOH-terminal thrombin- (serine protease-) binding domain. The patient point mutation is indicated by red colour in the dotted box at exon 7 (c.1320C>G); also, the result of this mutation is indicated on 440 a.a which leads to produced Leu (leucine) instead of Phe (phenylalanine) (adapted from 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>).</u>\n\n【5】There are two types of AT deficiency: quantitative (type I) and qualitative (type II). Quantitative (type I) AT deficiency occurs when the AT level is reduced, and the antigen/anticoagulant activity ratio is close to one. Patients with qualitative (type II) AT deficiency have normal antigen levels; however, the antigen/anticoagulant activity ratio is higher than one, indicating that a variant AT with impaired or null anticoagulant activity is present in plasma. Type II AT deficiency can be classified into three subtypes according to the AT functional defect, which is frequently associated with the location of the pathogenic mutation: IIa in the reactive site (RS), IIb in the heparin-binding site (HBS), and IIc in pleiotropic (PE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【6】In this case, we report a 7-year-old child with a novel homozygous detrimental mutation in SERPINC1 who presented at the age of 4 years with severe cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present the case of a 7-year-old female who presented at the age of 4 years with a history of fever, frequent vomiting, headache, and neck pain. The past medical history is remarkable for two episodes of simple febrile seizures at 2 and 3 years of age. The initial physical assessment showed that the patient was drowsy, had stiff neck, had a Glasgow coma scale of 12/15, and had a normal otherwise neurological assessment. The initial impression was of meningoencephalitis, which was managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The septic workup was negative. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR angiography (MRA), and MR venography (MRV) showed an extensive dural sinus and cerebral venous thrombosis with secondary sequela of bilateral thalamic and basal ganglia venous congestion and venous infarcts. The patient was started on unfractionated heparin. Antiphospholipid antibody screening was negative. Initial thrombophilia workup was remarkable for AT level of 14% (normal range, 80–120%). Thus, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) infusion was added to anticoagulation to replace AT. The patient was subsequently switched to enoxaparin with regular FFP infusions in the first year of therapy. The FFP was discontinued, and the patient was continued on enoxaparin with an anti-Xa level ranging between 0.2 and 0.4 IU/mL over the last two years, with no evidence of new or recurrent thrombosis. Oral anticoagulant was not given based on parental preference. AT level ranges now between 25 and 35%.\n\n【9】SERPINC1 gene sequencing targeted the following: the coding regions, 10 bp of flanking introns, and any previously described pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. This also included copy number variation analysis. DNA sequencing of SERPINC1 gene revealed a novel homozygous variant NM\\000488.3: c.1320C>G p. (Phe440Leu), which was not reported in Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), and 1000 Genomes Project (1000G). AT level was 56% in the father and 50% in the mother, and the older sister had AT level of 61%. The mother had a history of deep vein thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Homozygosity of SERPINC1 mutation in our patient was associated with type I AT deficiency. The patient presented with thrombosis at the age of 4 years, which was triggered by infection and dehydration. Most of the previously reported autosomal recessive AT deficiency cases developed severe arterial or venous thrombosis early in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The prevalence of inherited bleeding disorders varies from one population to another due to genetic differences and ethnicity. Little is known about bleeding disorder prevalence in the Saudi population. However, a study by Al Saleh et al. showed that the Saudi population has a higher prevalence of coagulation factor deficiency than the western population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Fewer data are available about AT deficiency in children due to the rarity of the disorder. Thus, the purpose of this report is to increase physician awareness about this rare severe illness.\n\n【13】The molecular genetic basis of AT deficiency has been extensively examined. AT deficiency is caused by 300 distinct SERPINC1 mutations according to ClinVar NIH website 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. To minimize this number, we only choose the pathogenic clinically significant and single nucleotide variant type. This gave us 34 clinical variants out of the 300 variants shown in Table 1 in the supplementary. The variant we presented in this article was not reported before. To understand this variant effect in our patient, we locate SERPINC1 point mutation on the gene structure, and c.1320C>G is in exon 7 in the C-terminal region of SERPINC1 protein, as shown in Figure 1. The SERPINC1 protein structure showed two main domains: the NH<sub>2</sub>\\-terminal heparin-binding domain encoded by exon 2 and a COOH-terminal thrombin- (serine protease-) binding domain encoded by exon 7. Exon 7 is transcribed to mRNA and then translated to amino acid numbers from 407 to 464, which contain the thrombin-binding domain. As the point mutation in our patient is located in exon 7, this mutation may affect the thrombin-binding activity on SERPINC1 protein which led to thrombosis in this case.\n\n【14】There are no clear guidelines on the optimal duration of anticoagulation in patients with homozygous AT deficiency. Long-term anticoagulation was continued in our patient because of concerns about the high risk of the development of new thrombosis which has been reported in cases before 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The optimal choice of anticoagulants (low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, or direct oral anticoagulant) in AT deficiency still needs to be defined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【16】Homozygous in SERPINC1 gene is a rare condition that could cause severe thrombosis. Therefore, patients with homozygous AT deficiency should continue using anticoagulation for life due to the increased risk of thrombus recurrence assumed from previous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However, the optimal choice of anticoagulants such as using low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, or direct oral anticoagulants in AT deficiency still needs to be defined. This report’s objective is to make physicians more aware of this severe and uncommon sickness.

Due to positive results for human parvovirus B19 (HPV-B19) IgM antibodies in the serum, diagnoses of HPV-B19 infection were made in both cases. Although acetaminophen failed to improve their deteriorating symptoms, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), loxoprofen, completely removed the symptoms immediately after the administration. In those cases, since the patients were predisposed to atopic disorders, an increased immunological response based on the lymphocyte hypersensitivity was likely to be involved in the pathogenesis. The immunomodulatory property of NSAID was thought to repress such lymphocyte activity and thus provided a rapid and sustained remission of the disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The classic symptoms of human parvovirus B19 (HPV-B19) infection include fever, rash, arthralgia, and edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In children, the symptoms are usually self-limited, resolving spontaneously within a few weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In adults, however, they are often prolonged, sometimes causing serious complications, such as chronic arthritis, myocarditis, and meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>, or triggering the onset of autoimmune diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. According to previous studies, the direct cytotoxicity of the virus has been ascribed to the pathogenesis of the symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. However, due to the absence of drugs that are effective for the virus, there is no causal treatment. To relieve the symptoms, analgesics or antipyretics are generally used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, although they do not shorten the duration of the disease. Here, we experienced two cases of HPV-B19 infection in adult patients with past histories of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis. In those cases, due to the atopic predispositions of the patients, an increased immunological response was more likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of the symptoms. In such cases, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), loxoprofen, dramatically improved their deteriorating symptoms immediately after the administration. The immunomodulatory property of this drug was thought to repress the lymphocyte activity, and thus provided a rapid and sustained remission of the disease.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【6】A 38-year-old woman with a childhood history of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis came to our outpatient clinic because of polyarthralgia and swelling of her fingers. Five days prior to her visit, she had upper respiratory symptoms and a low grade fever . Oral administration of 400 mg acetaminophen relieved those symptoms. Then, however, she developed a butterfly-shaped erythema on her face and swelling of her fingers. Three days later, although the facial erythema had improved, she developed joint pain in her fingers, wrists, shoulders, and knees, for which acetaminophen did not work. On physical examination, the patient looked tired. Her body temperature was 36.7°C, blood pressure was 94/50 mmHg, and pulse rate was 61 beats/min. She weighed 48 kg and was 153 cm tall. She had no rash except for a malar erythema that was faint at that time. All her fingers were swollen, but her wrist, shoulder, and knee joints were not. Both her legs had pretibial pitting edema. Laboratory data showed mild hypoproteinemia (serum protein 6.4 g/dL) and slightly decreased peripheral white blood cell count (4,100/μL). However, other hematologic parameters were relatively normal (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit 35.2%, reticulocyte 1.4%, and platelet count 230,000/μL). Liver enzymes and C-reactive protein levels were not elevated. Regardless of hypocomplementemia (C3 72 mg/dL, C4 9 mg/dL, and CH50 18.6 U/mL), the tests for serum antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Although　the IgG antibody was not examined, a positive result for HPV-B19 IgM antibody (index 7.97) indicated a recent infection of the virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Since microbiological tests for other viruses, such as measles and rubella, were negative, a diagnosis of HPV-B19 infection was finally made. Because her symptoms deteriorated despite the use of acetaminophen, oral administration of loxoprofen (180 mg/day) was alternatively started immediately after the diagnosis . The symptoms, including facial erythema, polyarthralgia, and the swelling of her fingers, rapidly disappeared within 12 hours after the initiation of the drug. No recurrence of the symptoms or signs was noted afterwards, indicating the complete remission of the disease.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Clinical course of Case  1.

Ten days prior to her visit, she had a low grade fever  when her 9-year-old son was diagnosed as having erythema infectiosum because of his slapped cheek rash. Seven days later, she developed a butterfly-shaped erythema transiently on her face that disappeared the next day. Then, she developed swelling of her fingers and joint pain in her shoulders, ankles, and knees. Since oral administration of acetaminophen did not relieve her symptoms, she came to our clinic. On physical examination, the patient looked tired. Her body temperature was 37.0°C, blood pressure was 110/72 mmHg, and pulse rate was 66 beats/min. She weighed 52 kg and was 160 cm tall. At that time, she presented no malar erythema and no rash in her body. Although all her fingers were swollen, the swelling of her shoulder, ankle, and knee joints was not obvious.

Liver enzymes and C-reactive protein levels were not elevated. Due to a positive result for HPV-B19 IgM antibody in the serum (index 8.20) and the preceding infection of her son, a diagnosis of HPV-B19 infection was made.

Discussion\n\n【12】Skin rashes and arthralgia are the most common clinical features in adult patients with HPV-B19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Previous studies have ascribed the pathogenesis of the symptoms to the direct cytotoxicity of the virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In our cases, however, it was less likely involved, because both patients developed the symptoms in the absence of reticulocytopenia or thrombocytopenia that usually coincides with viremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Although their clinical and laboratory features did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, their SLE-like features, including butterfly-shaped erythema and polyarthralgia, strongly suggested an increased immunological response. In addition, hypocomplementemia in Case  1, which occurs in both SLE and HPV-B19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>, indicated the activation of the classical complement pathway caused by the increase in immune complexes. Therefore, in our cases, such enhanced immunity was more likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of the symptoms. According to previous studies, patients with atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis are prone to develop autoimmune diseases due to the hypersensitivity of T-helper 2 lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u> or the dysregulated activity of B-lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In our cases, since both patients were predisposed to atopic disorders, such as atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, the HPV-B19 infection may have triggered the activity of the lymphocytes.\n\n【13】For adult patients with HPV-B19 infection, NSAIDs are often used to provide symptomatic relief for arthralgia and myalgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 18\\]</u>. However, since these drugs do not shorten the duration of the disease, the patients have to wait at least 1 to 2 weeks for the spontaneous remission of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. In our cases, although acetaminophen failed to ameliorate the patients’ symptoms, loxoprofen completely removed their deteriorating symptoms quickly after the administration . Therefore, in our cases, loxoprofen was thought to be responsible for the complete remission of the disease. NSAIDs are the most commonly used anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic drugs. Additionally, due to their immunomodulatory properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>, they have also been used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> and rheumatoid arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Studies have revealed that NSAIDs inhibit the migration of leukocytes or their cytokine production, either cyclooxygenase (COX) dependently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> or independently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>, and thus exert immunomodulatory effects. In the present cases, since the increased activity of lymphocytes was mainly involved in the pathogenesis, the immunomodulation by the NSAID was thought to be responsible for the rapid removal of the symptoms and the complete remission of the disease. Recently, we have demonstrated in a basic study that NSAIDs repress the activity of lymphocytes by the functional inhibition of delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup>\\-channels (Kv1.3) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Since T-lymphocytes highly express the channels in their plasma membranes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>, such mechanism may have greatly contributed to the immunomodulatory effect of NSAID in our patients. In this regard, besides the short-term use of immunosuppressive agents or steroids, the use of selective Kv1.3-channel blockers may also be useful. The early administration of such drugs would not only shorten the duration of the disease, but also prevent the serious complications caused by HPV-B19 infection or the onset of autoimmune diseases triggered by the virus.\n\n【14】In summary, this is the first report of HPV-B19 infection in adult patients with atopic predispositions showing the usefulness of NSAID for the quick removal of the symptoms. The immunomodulatory property of NSAID was thought to repress the increased lymphocyte activity and thus provided a rapid and sustained remission of the disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:42:11", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:42", "cost": 331.609}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:42:10"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Accessory and cavitated uterine mass (ACUM) is a rare newly described Mullerian anomaly, which generally presents with chronic recurrent pelvic pain and/or severe dysmenorrhea in women younger than 30 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is an accessory mass at the insertion of the round ligament that is lined by normal endometrium and has a dark-brown-colored fluid content 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. ACUMs are difficult to diagnose because of their broad differential diagnosis, which includes rudimentary and cavitated uterine horns such as those found in other uterine malformations (e.g. bicornuate uterus), adenomyosis with cystic or degenerated areas, degenerated leiomyomas, and essential and primary dysmenorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, fewer than 60 cases of ACUM are reported in the literature at the time of writing this paper. In this case report, we describe a 14-year-old girl presenting with severe pelvic pain since her menarche. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an apparent adnexal mass, but final histopathological examination was in favor of ACUM.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 14-year-old girl presented with chronic recurrent pelvic pain since her menarche. Her pain aggravated monthly during her menstruation; however, she had a regular and normal menstrual flow. Her personal history and family history were not significant, and she had no previous sexual history. Different kinds of anti-inflammatory medications had been prescribed for her during the past two years. The patient had also received oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for two months, but none of the medications had been significantly effective. On physical examination, she was a well-developed girl with normal vital signs. She showed normal pubertal development with a height of 160 centimeters (percentile: 47%) and weight of 48 kilograms (percentile: 43%), and normal adrenarche and thelarche (stage 4). Pelvic examination of the external genitalia was normal with no evidence of imperforated hymen. No definite palpable mass was detected during abdominal examination. Ultrasonography was requested, which showed normal size and myometrial echogenicity of the uterus with normal endometrial thickness. There was evidence of a left-sided heterogeneous and mostly hyperechoic 35 × 30 mm adnexal mass with close contact to the left ovary . Color Doppler showed some internal vascularity. A small right-sided simple ovarian cyst was also seen on ultrasound. The cervix and vaginal canal were unremarkable on imaging. For further characterization of the mentioned lesion, pelvic MRI was performed, which revealed a well-defined heterogeneous mass with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and low-to-intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images with significant enhancement after administration of gadolinium. The mass was located on the left side of the pelvic cavity, close to the left ovary and uterus; however, no connection to the uterus or ovary was detected. There was no pelvic lymphadenopathy or ascites. Based on the imaging findings, a paraovarian mass or a myoma was suspected. Subsequently, the patient underwent laparotomy, and a well-defined fleshy mass was seen on the left side of the pelvic cavity. The mass was located just under the round ligament, close to but separated from the left ovary with no adhesion to the surrounding structures. Both ovaries and uterus were normal except for a simple right-sided ovarian cyst with no endometrial implants. The uterus had two normally developed fallopian tubes with no fundal impression or contour abnormality and two normal cornua. On close observation, the uterus was completely separated from the mentioned mass. Several collateral vessels arising from the left uterine artery, which provided arterial supply to the mass, were ligated during surgery to obtain hemostasis. Frozen section revealed normal myometrial muscle with reactive endometrium. Finally, the mass was successfully resected by enucleation and incision through the serosa. While performing complete excision, a chocolate-colored fluid flowed out from the mass. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged one day after surgery. She continued to be asymptomatic with complete resolution of the cyclic pelvic pain after one year of follow-up. Gross evaluation of the pelvic mass revealed a cavitated mass with a thick muscular wall, and pathological examination showed normal irregular myometrium lined by functional endometrium . Thus, a final diagnosis of accessory and cavitated uterine mass was made. Retrospective re-evaluation of pelvic MRI demonstrated a well-defined mass with signal intensity similar to the uterus on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences with central hypersignal endometrium and normal endometrial-myometrial interface .\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) On ultrasound, sagittal view of the pelvis shows the uterus with a normal uterine contour and normal echogenic endometrial line (arrow).

Discussion\n\n【11】Genitourinary development results from a complex interaction between the Wolffian ducts and the Mullerian ducts. Mullerian ducts are formed through invagination of the dorsal coelomic epithelium at about gestational week 6. At around 10 to 12 weeks of gestation, the two Mullerian ducts, fused with each other in a craniocaudal direction,finally fuse with the urogenital sinus, forming the uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes and the upper one-third of the vagina consequently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Mullerian anomalies are deviations from normal anatomy resulting from distortion of the complex embryogenesis. Although these anomalies are usually benign conditions, they may lead to significant reproductive problems based on the degree as well as the type of maldevelopment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. These commonly occurring anomalies can be found in about 4–7% of the population; so, an effective and reliable classification of Mullerian anomalies can contribute to proper diagnosis and management of affected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Mullerian anomalies were classified by Acien and colleagues in 1992 for the first time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>; however, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and the European Society for Gynecological Endoscopy (ESHRE/ESGE) recently updated the classification system of female genital anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In this categorization, the main classes are designed on the basis of deviations from normal uterine anatomy deriving from the same embryological origin, while the clinical significance and degree of deformity are the basis for subclasses classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Uterine-like mass (ULM) is a distinct clinical entity defined as a cavitated mass lined with functional endometrium that is composed of sex hormone-sensitive smooth muscle cells, which are arranged irregularly at the periphery of the mass. These masses can be located within the uterus or anywhere else outside the uterus. ACUM, a subtype of non communicating ULM, is a rare newly described anomaly that, unlike other Mullerian anomalies, is associated with an otherwise normal uterus; hence, it should be classified as a separate entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Persistence or duplication of Mullerian duct due to a gubernaculum dysfunction at the site of round ligament attachment has been postulated as the pathogenesis of ACUM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The same appearing masses have been described in the literature by different names, including cavitated adenomyoma, accessory cavitated mass, and juvenile cystic adenomyoma. However, ACUM is different from cystic adenomyosis, which usually occurs in middle-aged women, and is characterized by diffusely distributed adenomyotic foci within the uterus. Also, cystic adenomyosis lacks the normal endometrium and myometrium organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The current criteria used for the diagnosis of ACUM includes: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an isolated accessory cavitated mass; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> normal uterus (endometrial cavity), tubes, and ovaries; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> surgical case with excised mass and with pathological examination; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> accessory cavity lined by endometrial epithelium with glands and stroma; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> chocolate-brown-colored fluid content; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> no adenomyosis (if uterus removed), but there could be small foci of adenomyosis in the myometrium adjacent to the accessory cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The present case fulfilled all of the diagnostic criteria for ACUM; in addition, since the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries were normal in this patient, other Mullerian anomalies were ruled out. ACUM has multiple challenging differential diagnoses, such as cavitated uterine horn with degenerated area or rudimentary uterine horn; however, imaging modalities such as hysterosalpingography, ultrasound, and especially MRI can aid in making a proper diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 12, 13\\]</u>. Although most of the reported ACUM cases are located on the right lateral wall of the uterus near the round ligament, about one-third of cases are adjacent to the left round ligament, as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 presents a summary of the main findings of patients with ACUM that have been reported in previous studies. The most common symptoms in patients with ACUM are severe dysmenorrhea and recurrent pelvic pain that may occur before, during, or after menstruation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

However, ACUM is diagnosed when an isolated cavitated mass is resected via surgery in patients with otherwise normal uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Conclusively, ACUM is a rare Mullerian anomaly and treatable cause of severe dysmenorrhea in young females. To the best of our knowledge, most cases, as ours, are misdiagnosed before surgery, and diagnosis can only be confirmed after histopathological examination; hence, we recommend imaging modalities such as MRI for better evaluation. Pelvic MRI is highly accurate in making a diagnosis of ACUM in young women who present with early-onset dysmenorrhea and recurrent periodic pelvic pain, especially with otherwise normal uterus and ovaries. Although the true prevalence of ACUMs is not known yet, we believe that this clinical entity is in fact more common than currently thought. Thus, ACUM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with clinically relevant symptoms.\n\n【21】#### Abbreviations:\n\n| ACUM: | Accessory and cavitated uterine mass |\n| --- | --- |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| OCP: | Oral contraceptive pill |\n| ULM: | Uterine-like mass. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Abbreviations:\n\nACUM:\tAccessory and cavitated uterine mass\nMRI:\tMagnetic resonance imaging\nOCP:\tOral contraceptive pill\nULM:\tUterine-like mass.", "content": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Accessory and cavitated uterine mass (ACUM) is a rare form of Mullerian anomaly that usually presents in young females with chronic cyclic pelvic pain and/or dysmenorrhea.

Case Report\n\n【6】A 72-year-old woman was diagnosed as having primary lung cancer (cT1N0M0 stageⅠA) of the right upper lobe . Because her respiratory function was not sufficient for her to undergo surgical resection, she was treated with SBRT. Irradiation was performed with a 4-MV and 10-MV linear accelerator. Forty-eight Gy in 4 fractions was prescribed at the isocenter with multiple static ports. The isodose distribution of SBRT is shown in Figure 2. Serum CEA was elevated to 14.7 n/mL, but serum KL-6 (230 U/mL) and SP-D (72.8 ng/mL) were not elevated before SBRT.

On CT images 2 months after treatment, irregularly shaped patchy consolidation, which was considered radiation pneumonitis, appeared in the irradiated field . After 6 and 9 months, the patchy consolidation was retracted, which was considered to be typical radiation fibrosis , and serum CEA gradually decreased. However, after 12 months, mass-like consolidation appeared around the irradiated area , and after 13 months, it had increased in size. Because ecstatic air-containing bronchi were not observed within the consolidation, and the 3b branch of the right lung was displaced on CT images, the possibility of local recurrence was considered. At this time, serum CEA, KL-6, and SP-D were not elevated compared with the previous values. FDG-PET revealed high uptake (SUV m a x \\= 5 . 6 1 ) for the consolidation . CT-guided biopsy was performed. The result of cytology was class II, and histologically cancer cells were not detected.

Discussion\n\n【16】On CT images, parenchymal consolidation with a straight lateral margin and air bronchograms is typical for radiation fibrosis, whereas a homogeneous opacity without air bronchograms and with a convex border is strongly suggestive of recurrent tumor in the irradiated lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In addition, the filling in of bronchi within radiation fibrosis is abnormal and usually represents local recurrent malignancy or a superimposed infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Koenig et al. firstly described as mass-like radiation fibrosis related to 3-D conformal radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Mass-like radiation fibrosis in their cases was accompanied by volume loss and bronchiectasis. However, in our case, neither volume loss nor bronchiectasis was observed at the presence of mass-like consolidation. Therefore, it was difficult to differentially diagnose this mass-like consolidation as radiation fibrosis from local recurrence. Aoki et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported patchy consolidation or discrete consolidation in 74% of cases during the first 6 months after SBRT. In SBRT, the shape of the dose distribution with a lower dose tended to become large and irregular, while a higher dose could be concentrated uniformly on the tumor. Matsuo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported that mass-like consolidation appeared in 27 (68%) of 40 tumors treated with SBRT. Of these 27 mass-like consolidations, 24 were radiation-induced lung injuries (RILI) and 3 were local recurrences. According to the previous reports mentioned above, it is not uncommon for mass-like consolidation to appear after SBRT. In conventional radiation therapy, the shape of the dose distribution of irradiated lungs is simple, and the boundary between the nonirradiated and irradiated lung is usually distinct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In contrast, in SBRT, multiple non coplanar portals with various directions were used. And the dose distribution usually has a 3-D shape and concentrates around the tumor. Therefore, radiation fibrosis after SBRT can appear in a 3-D shape, and is sometimes observed as mass-like lesions. In our case, also, the consolidation after SBRT had a 3-D shape, and was observed in approximately 50% or more of the isodose area.\n\n【17】Matsuo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> also reported that mass-like consolidations appeared at a median of 5 months (range, 2 to 9 months) after SBRT. The time to the appearance of the mass-like consolidations after SBRT was 2 to 9 months (median, 5 months) in RILI cases and 4 to 7 months (median, 7 months) in local recurrence cases. There was no significant difference in the time to appearance between RILI and local recurrence. According to their report, the size of the mass-like consolidations did not increase in any RILI cases after 12 months or later. In our case, however, the mass-like consolidation appeared at 12 months after SBRT, and had increased in size at 13 months. Radiation fibrosis can appear as mass-like consolidation even 12 months or more after the completion of SBRT.\n\n【18】In our case, serum CEA was also elevated in addition to the mass-like consolidation. The CEA elevation and the late appearance of the mass-like consolidation made it very difficult to differentially diagnose this condition as RILI from local recurrence. Several authors have reported that CEA elevation is observed in patients with various pulmonary inflammations such as acute pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, especially in cases with mucoid impaction, and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>. In our case, after 31 months, transient and slight re-elevation of serum CEA was seen, accompanied by the elevation of serum KL-6 and SP-D. CT examination at this time revealed minimal lung opacities, suggesting the presence of pneumonia in the left lower lobe, but no significant change in the irradiated area. This finding also suggested that the transient CEA elevation after SBRT was related to inflammatory changes of the lung in this case. The serum CEA level of smokers has been reported to be higher than that of nonsmokers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. CEA secretion from pulmonary epithelial cells has been considered to be influenced by smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This patient was a heavy smoker, and serum CEA did not decrease to its normal level after SBRT. The elevation of the serum CEA level before SBRT may have been caused not only by the tumor but also by heavy smoking.\n\n【19】Serum KL-6 and SP-D are useful serum markers of inflammatory lung diseases, typically interstitial pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. It has also been reported that KL-6 and SP-D can become elevated in some cases of adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In our case, however, serum KL-6 and SP-D levels were not elevated before SBRT. Also, serial changes of these serum marker levels were almost synchronous with the radiological change of the consolidation after SBRT and that following pneumonia in the left lower lung. Therefore, the changes in the serum KL-6 and SP-D levels after SBRT were considered to reflect the severity of the pulmonary inflammation rather than the progression of cancer.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】We experienced a case of radiation fibrosis appearing as mass-like consolidation after SBRT with the elevation of serum CEA, which was difficult to distinguish from local recurrence. If it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis by further examination including FDG-PET and histological examination, short-interval follow-up should be recommended.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:48", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:55:19", "cost": 30.885}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:55:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:45"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Granulomonocytapheresis (GMA) is a novel nonpharmacologic approach for treating irritable bowel disease using extracorporeal immunomodulation (cytapheresis). It is an effective treatment for inducing remission in patients with refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). Furthermore, GMA has very few side effects and can be performed without using drugs except anticoagulants. However, GMA is sometimes challenging to perform, especially in children, as it usually requires securing two blood vessels. To overcome this problem, we attempted GMA by the single-needle method, which is performed by securing only one blood vessel. Here, we report the case of a girl with UC who underwent GMA using the single-needle method followed by its assessment of feasibility for future use.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 12-year-old girl developed abdominal pain and reported frequent bloody stools for over a month. She had been diagnosed with moderate left-sided UC at nine years of age. Remission was initially induced with prednisolone, and she remained in remission with azathioprine due to mesalazine intolerance. She experienced moon face and increased appetite as side effects while taking prednisolone. She was later diagnosed with a UC relapse based on colonoscopic findings of marked erythema and the absence of vascular pattern. Because of the side effects of previous prednisolone therapy, the patient and her guardian declined further steroid therapy. We decided to induce remission with GMA. However, securing two blood vessels for GMA was expected to be difficult because of the patient’s small anthropometric measurement (height: 134.9 cm, weight: 31.7 kg). Therefore, we elected to perform GMA with the single-needle method. She underwent GMA once per week for 10 weeks. A 17-gauge dialysis puncture needle (outer diameter: 1.4 mm, length: 25 mm) was inserted into the right elbow . The dialysis console processed a blood flow rate of 40 mL/min (total blood volume: 1,800 mL). In this case, the treatment time was 90 minutes. No decrease in blood pressure was observed during this procedure. Heparin was used as an anticoagulant. All 10 GMA treatments were completed without puncture failure or poor blood removal. Additionally, no side effects were observed. However, the patient did not attain remission with GMA. After an unsuccessful attempt of oral tacrolimus therapy, remission could be achieved and has maintained with infliximab (5 mg/kg, every 8 weeks) for 10 months.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Granulomonocytapheresis with the single-needle method. A 17-gauge dialysis puncture needle (outer diameter: 1.4 mm, length: 25 mm) is inserted into the right elbow vein.</u>\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【8】Although treatments for UC include mesalazine, steroids, immunomodulators, and biologics, cytapheresis (including GMA) has also been reported as an effective therapeutic strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Disorders such as UC reflect overactive immune activation which is driven by cytokines derived from myeloid leukocytes (such as granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages). In GMA, cellulose acetate beads selectively adsorb and deplete myeloid cells and a small fraction of lymphocytes, thereby inducing anti-inflammatory effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Because GMA is a nonpharmacological treatment for UC, it is useful for children in whom the side effects of drugs, especially steroids, need to be avoided as much as possible. Although our patient developed mild dizziness because of the orthostatic dysregulation after the end of GMA, it appeared transiently and disappeared spontaneously. The incidence of adverse effects with GMA is significantly lower than that in conventional pharmacotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【9】When GMA is performed in children, securing the blood vessels is often a problem because of the small blood vessels. It is necessary to secure two blood vessels for blood removal and blood supply channels with conventional GMA. If it becomes difficult to secure blood vessels with this approach, conventional GMA must be abandoned. The single-needle method would become the alternative for performing GMA in such pediatric UC cases. In this method, blood removal and blood transfer are performed by securing only one blood vessel. In the blood removal process, the clamp closes and the blood pump rotates to remove blood. When the venous pressure in the circuit rises to 100 mm Hg, the blood pump stops, clamp is opened, and blood return process is started. When venous pressure in the circuit drops to 15 mm Hg, the blood removal process starts again . An advantage of the single-needle method is reduced psychological stress compared with the conventional method because the method results in a single blood vessel puncture. It also reduces the likelihood of an inability to puncture. Although a 17-gauge puncture needle did not result in poor blood removal, in this case, it is necessary to examine whether GMA can be performed with a smaller diameter puncture needle to reduce the burden on patients. In contrast, in the single-needle method, blood removal and blood transfer cannot be performed at the same time, so it takes longer to perform than conventional GMA, which takes approximately 60 minutes. In addition, the blood removal time should be monitored while paying attention to the decrease in blood pressure.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Circuit of granulomonocytapheresis with the single-needle method. Black arrow represents the blood flow.</u>\n\n【11】In our patient, GMA and TAC in 24 weeks were ineffective at inducing remission, and infliximab was required. Therefore, this case does not show the effectiveness of GMA.\n\n【12】The effectiveness of intensive GMA therapy that is administered several times a week has been previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. In case of a lack of response to infliximab, concomitant use with GMA should be considered to avoid surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In addition, GMA is more effective in steroid-naive patients than in steroid-exposed patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>; therefore, an early introduction is desirable. In future, the single-needle method may become an effective procedure for performing GMA in children.\n\n【13】In conclusion, the single-needle method may potentially be a useful GMA method for treating UC in children in whom securing blood vessels is expected to be difficult.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:15:50", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:16:23", "cost": 32.645}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:16:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:15:49"}

Segmental motion abnormalities of the left ventricular wall were not detectable in echocardiography. Instead, the presence of a right ventricular strain raised the suspicion of a lung artery embolization.

We present a case of a bilateral lung artery embolization mimicking an acute myocardial infarction.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A woman in her 80s, with no history of cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors, was admitted to our territory medical center with acute dyspnea and sinus tachycardia of 1 hour’s duration. Further symptoms were not assessable, due to an underlying dementia. Shortly before admission, she had a syncope and systemic arterial hypotension of 80/50 mmHg. On her arrival to our emergency department, her heart rate war regular at an average of 110 bpm, respiration rate was 35 per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 80% on ambient air. Results of blood chemistry tests and complete blood cell count revealed a serum lactate of 10 mmol/L (normal range 0.5–1.0 mmol/L) without further abnormalities. The initial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) was 1027 pg/ml (normal range <400 pg/ml), and ST-segment elevation was present in II, III, aVF and V3–V6 of a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) . A bedside echocardiography revealed an acute right ventricular strain, but left ventricular systolic function was normal, without segmental wall motion abnormalities. A computed tomography (CT scan) of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of a bilateral pulmonary artery embolization (PAE) . A rescue thrombolytic therapy with 100 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was administered intravenously. 12 hours later, respiratory stability was achieved and the patient remained hemodynamically stable without catecholamine. Nevertheless, ST-segment elevation persisted and hs-cTnI was still above the normal range with 40.580 pg/ml. A repeated bedside echocardiography revealed improvement of the right ventricular strain and left ventricular systolic function remained intact. However, 30 hours later, electromechanical disassociation suddenly occurred, and the patient died.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showing an ST-segment elevation in II, III, aVF, and V3–V6.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, showing the bilateral pulmonary artery embolization (PAE) (the thin arrow on the right side and the thick arrow on the left side).</u>\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Severe respiratory insufficiency and hemodynamic instability occurred after bilateral pulmonary artery embolization in our case. Abnormal hs-cTnI and ST-segmental elevation in II, III, aVF, and V3–V6, otherwise signs of an acute myocardial infarction, were interpreted in the context of the concurrent right ventricular strain, which was present in echocardiography. Traditional electrocardiographic manifestations of acute cor pulmonale, such as SI QIII or SI QIII TIII pattern, right bundle branch block, P pulmonale, or rightward QRS complex axis shift were absent in the patient’s ECG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. According to a retrospective study by Stein PD et al. the most common electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with acute submassive or massive pulmonary embolism are nonspecific T-wave changes and nonspecific elevation or depression of the RST segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Ischemic signs, mimicking acute coronary syndrome, have been also described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Because segmental motion abnormalities of the left ventricular wall were absent in the admission echocardiography of our case, we avoided performing an emergency coronary angiography, even though both electrocardiographic changes and the elevation of hs-cTnI denoted an ongoing ischemic myocardial trauma. We supposed that the underlying state of severe systemic hypoxemia caused a global myocardial tissue hypoperfusion, which was rather functional than anatomical as observed in conditions of a coronary artery occlusion due to arterial thrombosis.\n\n【11】An additional argument for not performing an emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is that the administered thrombolytic therapy already consisted a validated treatment in the hypothetical case of an underlying acute myocardial infarction, and therefore, both conditions were concurrently treated with this therapeutical approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【12】After thrombolytic therapy was administered, hs-cTnI remained detectable in abnormal levels and ST-segment elevation was present in serial electrocardiographic controls. The persistence of elevated heart enzymes and abnormal electrocardiographic findings up to two weeks after pulmonary artery embolization is a well-described phenomenon and, therefore, raised no worries in the medical team, regarding the issue of a prolonged myocardial hypoperfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【13】However, the coronary status of the patient and the presence of a concurrent myocardial infarction remain uncertain, as a postmortem examination has been opposed from the patient’s relatives. Whether an early coronary angiography could have influenced the clinical course of our case is debatable. The authors believe that even if an acute myocardial infarction was present, thrombolytic therapy was still indicated as the primary treatment option because shock and respiratory insufficiency, due to the underlying pulmonary embolism, were the main clinical manifestations, presenting a vital threatening condition on admission.\n\n【14】#### 4\\.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) also known as Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, which results in vascular dysplasia affecting mainly visceral and mucocutaneous organs. Case Presentation. A 65-year-old woman with a 12-year history of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis presented with shortness of breath, easy fatigability, and bilateral lower limb edema. Her family history was significant for definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in first-degree relatives. During the previous 15 days, she has experienced three episodes of recurrent nasal bleeding. She has a background of chronic mitral regurgitation. Physical examination revealed telangiectases in her tongue, lower lip, and hand in addition to signs of congestive heart failure. The patient met 3\\\\4 Curacao criteria and had a definite HHT. Her laboratory workup revealed a hemoglobin count of 5.4 g/dl. Echocardiography revealed a left systolic ejection fraction of 51% with left atrial dilatation and severe mitral regurgitation. Chest X-ray showed features of cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. The abdominal ultrasonography showed enlarged liver size with homogenous texture and congested hepatic veins without features of hepatic AVMs. She was treated with intravenous frusemide, iron supplement, tranexamic acid, blood transfusion, and nasal packing. Conclusions. HTT usually passes unnoticed in Sudan. The rarity of HHT, difficulties in affording diagnostic imaging studies, and low clinical suspicion among doctors are important contributing factors. Anemia resulting from recurrent epistaxis might have an influential role in precipitating acute heart failure in those with chronic rheumatic valvular disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare genetic disorder, which has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The estimated prevalence is 1/5000–1/8000 of population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is characterized by diffuse telangiectases (e.g. ruby-coloured papules that blanch with pressure), recurrent epistaxis, and widespread arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Males and females are equally affected.\n\n【4】The diagnosis is based on the presence of three out of four criteria, called Curaçao criteria, which include recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, small systemic telangiectasia (due to AVMs), visceral involvement, and a strong family history of HHT .\n\n【5】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 The Curacao diagnostic criteria for HHT.</u>\n\n【6】Although the symptoms usually vary according to age, epistaxis is usually the commonest clinical feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【7】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of HHT in Sudan. The rarity of the disease, difficulties in affording the diagnostic imagining and genetic testing, and low clinical suspicion among doctors, all of which pose a challenge in the diagnosis and management of HHT, particularly in resources- limited hospitals.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case presentation\n\n【9】A 65-year-old Sudanese woman came to a university hospital, Sudan, complaining of shortness of breath (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3), easy fatigability, and bilateral lower limb edema. The patient had no history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension. During the previous 15 days, she has experienced three episodes of recurrent nasal bleeding, which were not related to any particular activity, posture, or seasonal variation. There was no bleeding from other orifices. For many years, episodes of nasal bleeding occurred frequently, and the patient received medical advice at their rural hospital. During those episodes, the patient underwent anterior nasal packing, transfused, and then discharged on iron supplements. The patient then came to a university hospital for more advanced evaluation. During the patient workup, the patient experienced an episode of epistaxis for which she underwent anterior nasal packing to control the epistaxis and received tranexamic acid 500 mg tabs TDS, topical tranexamic acid, and packed cells for transfusion. The workup revealed that the patient is a known case of chronic mitral regurgitation, and she was planned for mitral valve replacement, which was not performed due to financial challenges.\n\n【10】The family history was significant for definite HHT in the form of recurrent spontaneous nose bleeding and the same small erythematous lesions (telangiectases) in her grandmother, her son, and her daughter.\n\n【11】Physical examination revealed that the patient looked ill, pale, and not jaundiced. JVP was raised. Her BP was 110/60, pulse rate was 88 BPM, and it was not collapsing. The oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. Mouth examination revealed multiple small erythematous lesions, which blanch on pressure (telangiectases) on her tongue  and one lesion on her lower lip . Hand examination revealed one telangiectasia at the palmar aspect of her right hand . Her cardiovascular examination revealed a pan systolic murmur at the apical area, which radiated to the axilla, and bilateral fine basal crepitations. The liver was tender and palpable 8 cm below the right costal margin without audible bruit, and there is bilateral lower limb edema.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The tongue showing multiple small telangiectasias.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Small telangiectasia at the left border of the lower lip.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Telangiectasias at the palmar aspect of the distal phalanx of the middle finger and the distal phalanx of the little finger.</u>\n\n【15】The laboratory investigations at admission revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia (hemoglobin 5.4 g/dl). Other laboratory investigations are described in Table 2.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 It describes the results of the blood investigations obtained for the patient.</u>\n\n【17】ECG was noncontributory apart from sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray revealed upper lobe diversion, congested hilar shadows and patchy consolidation in lower lobes (features of pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly) . Echocardiography showed a left systolic ejection fraction of 51% with left atrial dilatation and severe mitral regurgitation. The abdominal ultrasonography (US) displayed enlarged liver size (19 cm) with homogenous texture and congested hepatic veins. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations were not detected on ultrasonography .\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Chest X-ray posterior/anterior view revealed upper lobe diversion and congested hilar shadows and patchy consolidation in lower lobes (features of pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly).</u>\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Abdominal US showing the liver enlarged in size (19 cm) with homogenous texture and congested hepatic veins.</u>\n\n【20】Diagnostic challenges: CT pulmonary angiography was not done due to financial challenges. Contrast echocardiography is an alternative. It was intended to screen the patient for the presence of pulmonary AVMs. Screening can be performed with contrast echocardiography and then a CT-scan in case of a right-to-left shunt. The most feared complication of a pulmonary AVM, cq a right-to-left shunt, is brain abscess, due to paradoxical septical emboli, which are normally trapped in the pulmonary capillaries, but can pass through the pulmonary AVM. As long as the presence of a right-to-left shunt is not excluded in HHT patients, prophylactic antibiotics should be prescribed before any nonsterile procedures, to prevent brain abscess.\n\n【21】Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen was also not done due to financial challenges. It was meant to detect hepatic AVMs and to exclude high-output heart failure. However, clinically, there were no features of hyperdynamic circulation in the patient (e.g. collapsing pulse).\n\n【22】The diagnosis was definite HHT as she fulfilled three items of the Curacao criteria (spontaneous, recurrent nose bleeding, family history in a first-degree relative, and multiple telangiectases at characteristic sites such as tongue, lips, and hands). Anemia, which was attributed to recurrent epistaxis and nutritional factors, is thought to play an influential role in precipitating the heart failure in this patient with chronic rheumatic mitral regurgitation.\n\n【23】The patient was treated with intravenous frusemide, iron supplement, tranexamic acid, blood transfusion, and nasal packing. She was discharged on day 7 on lisinopril tablets and iron supplements in addition to counselling about home-preventive measures of epistaxis.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVM) of the internal organs and mucocutaneous telangiectasias. These AVMs lack the intervening capillaries resulting in direct connections between arteries and veins. They can involve the skin, mucous membranes, brain, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and/or liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The most common clinical features are recurrent spontaneous nosebleeds which present in 50% of patients with HHT at the age of ten, with incidence increasing with age.\n\n【26】HHT was first described in 1864 in a man with a vascular malformation and recurrent epistaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In 1996, Rendu first noticed the correlation between hereditary epistaxis and telangiectasia in a 52-year-old man 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Osler in 1901 and Weber in 1907 then identified the association between hemorrhagic lesions in the skin and mucous membranes and its familial inheritance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. The name ‘hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia’ described by Hanes in 1909 defines the characteristics of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Mutation in genes, including ACVRL1, ENG, and SMAD4 genes, are responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The ENG mutation can lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, while type 2 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is caused by mutations in the ACVRL1 gene. Juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome is caused by a mutation in the SMAD4 gene. It has been proposed that certain mutated HHT genes are associated with specific clinical features, for example, ACVRL1 mutation was found to be associated more with liver AVMs, spinal AVMs, epistaxis, and pulmonary hypertension. ENG mutations were seen to be associated more with pulmonary and brain AVMs, and MADH4 mutations were observed to be associated with juvenile colonic polyposis.\n\n【28】The diagnosis of HHT depends on diagnostic criteria called Curacao criteria . Our patient was diagnosed as definite HHT as she fulfilled three items of the Curacao criteria (spontaneous, recurrent nose bleeding, family history in a first-degree relative, and multiple telangiectasias at characteristic sites such as tongue, lips, and hands).\n\n【29】In patients with HHT, heart failure usually occurs due to hepatic arterial-venous malformation, which causes high-output heart failure. In our patient, anemia, which was attributed to recurrent epistaxis and nutritional factors, is thought to play an influential role in precipitating the heart failure in this patient with chronic rheumatic mitral regurgitation. Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of HHT; chronic blood loss from nasal mucosa or intestinal tract can result in depletion of iron storage, which in turn can lead to microcytic or normocytic anemia.\n\n【30】As per ESC Guidelines HF 2016, in the initial assessment of a patient with newly diagnosed heart failure, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are the recommended diagnostic tests. The treatment is recommended when ferritin is <100 µg/L, or ferritin is between 100 and 299 µg/L and TSAT <20%.\n\n【31】There is no curative treatment for HHT; treatment is symptomatic which focuses on the predominant clinical feature and its severity. The first step in the management of epistaxis is patient counselling about the use of home-preventive measures such as nasal humidification, saline sprays, or ointment to avoid dryness of nasal mucosa and to decrease the risk of nasal trauma in the form of nasal picking and nasal blowing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Other options included nasal packing, photocoagulation, intravascular embolization, and surgery. These methods have a high rate of recurrence with limited efficacy, and they are not available in many resources- limited hospitals. Drugs such as bevacizumab (an antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) are widely used in the treatment of high-output heart cardiac failure in HHT with adequate safety and efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Tamoxifen (antiestrogen medication) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and thalidomide (an antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory agent) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> had been also investigated in the treatment of HHT.\n\n【32】According to ESC, treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the treatment of the underlying cause such as anemia; diuretics are recommended in congested patients with HFpEF to alleviate symptoms and signs.\n\n【33】Patients with HHT have a lower life expectancy than the general population; the prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms. The most common cause of death in HHT is heart failure and sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【34】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【35】In conclusion, cases of HHT may have been passed unnoticed due to rarity of the disease that leads to low clinical suspicion among doctors. Other contributing factors include variation in clinical presentations of the disease, difficulties in affording the diagnostic imaging studies, and the imaging studies might not be available in many resourses-limited hospitals. Anemia resulting from the recurrent epistaxis might have an influential role in precipitating acute heart failure in those with chronic rheumatic valvular disease.\n\n【36】#### Abbreviations\n\n| HHT: | Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia |\n| --- | --- |\n| OWRD: | Osler-Weber-Rendu disease |\n| AVMs: | Arteriovenous malformations |\n| NYHA: | New York Heart Association |\n| BNP: | Brain natriuretic peptide |\n| HFpEF: | Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction |\n| ACVRL1: | Activin A receptor-like type 1 |\n| ENG: | Endoglin |\n| TSAT: | Transferrin saturation. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:26", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:39", "cost": 13.156}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:25"}

Introduction\n\n【3】The COVID-19 pandemic has affected 109 million people, causing 2.4 million deaths worldwide to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The pandemic has now entered a new phase with the roll-out of several vaccines. The prompt announcement of the outbreak and early publication of information on the genetic sequence of the virus allowed for an unprecedentedly early initiation of COVID-19 vaccine development. In contrast, to date, although vaccine studies for some other RNA viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C are ongoing, these vaccines are not yet available for use in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】A goal of manufacturing a safe and efficacious vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 had to be achieved within a 6- to 18-month timeline, generating over 200 vaccine candidates, with 50 in human clinical trials and 18 in efficacy testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The time normally reserved for the exploration of dosing and scheduling optimization has been greatly reduced by the urgent demand for efficacious COVID-19 vaccines. The close spacing of doses has the advantage of rapid distribution of the vaccines. Ideally, the development of vaccines also prioritizes the optimal scheduling of doses that would allow for the highest immunity generated and the most durable immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【5】On 13 January 2021, the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out officially began in Indonesia, distributing CoronaVac, a vaccine with chemically inactivated whole-virus vaccine with alum as an adjuvant. Vaccine-associated disease enhancement (VADE) is a modified, often more severe presentation of clinical infection in individuals exposed to a pathogen after having received prior vaccination for the same pathogen. Vaccines for infection by viruses that will cause inflammatory damage are likely to result in VADE, for example, SARS-CoV and RSV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Currently, little is known about the potential of VADE following COVID-19 immunization. Understanding VADE is important for the decision-making by the public, clinicians, and policymakers and is warranted for successful vaccination uptake. We herewith describe two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed symptoms and presented to the emergency department each following 2 doses and 1 dose of CoronaVac vaccination.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】The first patient, a 24-year-old man, presented to the emergency department (ED) of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (RSCM) with the chief complaint of fever which had been present for one day. Notable symptoms upon diagnosis were coughing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and fever. There was no dyspnea, but dysgeusia and anosmia developed on the second day of admission. There were no comorbidities such as obesity or underlying pulmonary disease. The patient was found to have received the first and second doses of CoronaVac 19 days and 5 days prior to the onset of symptoms, respectively. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, and lung examination demonstrated coarse rales, dominant in the lower left lung. Upon admission, the patient had a hemoglobin level of 14.8 g/dl, leukocyte count of 7.010/µl, and platelet count of 258.000/µl. The patient had a D-dimer level of 210 µg/l and fibrinogen level of 271 mg/dl, with CRP and procalcitonin levels of 115 mg/l and 0.04 ng/ml, respectively. Laboratory examinations revealed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive with RdRP Cq of 17.70, E-gene Cq of 17.27, and N-gene Cq of 16.65. Chest X-ray revealed a typical COVID-19 radiological appearance of diffuse infiltrate at the base which extended to the periphery of the lungs.\n\n【8】The second patient, a 49-year-old man, came with the chief complaint of fever. The fever was present for 3 days and had started 11 days before admission, ranging from 37.7–38.0°C. The fever started on the same day when the patient received his vaccination. There was unproductive cough, and anosmia and dysgeusia developed on the same day with the fever onset. Diarrhea occurred 1 day before presentation to the hospital. The patient also had longstanding hypertension and diabetes mellitus without regular checkups or medications. At presentation, the patient was hypertensive, with a blood pressure of 190/80 mmHg. There were no rales or other physical abnormalities upon physical examination. Laboratory examination revealed hyperglycemia, hyponatremia hypoosmolar euvolemia, and hypokalemia. Procalcitonin was 0.08 ng/ml and CRP was 79.2 mg/l, while fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were 678.4 mg/dl and 380 µg/l, respectively. Chest X-ray revealed a typical COVID-19 radiological appearance of basal nodular infiltrate at the periphery of the lungs, especially on the left side. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed a complete right bundle branch block (RBBB). SARS-CoV-2 PCR on the admission day was positive with RdRP Cq of 28.27, E-gene Cq of 27.83, and N-gene Cq of 27.28. The timeline of vaccination and disease manifestation of both patients and chest X-ray are presented in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. Both patients had almost similar levels of S-RBD protein titers of 18 and 15 U/ml. Complete laboratory data of the patients can be found in Supplemental Data 1.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The history of vaccinations and development of symptoms in patient 1 after 1 dose of CoronaVac vaccine and in patient 2 after 2 doses of CoronaVac vaccine.

In both patients, exposure to confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred within 2 weeks prior to the presentation of symptoms.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Chest X-rays of the patients.

Discussion\n\n【12】We report two hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and a history of CoronaVac vaccinations. The first patient with a relatively milder course of the disease had received two doses of CoronaVac, whereas the second patient with a more progressive course of the disease received only one dose before developing symptoms and being admitted to the hospital. Upon admission of the patients, we were presented with the scientific questions as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> whether the SARS-COV-2 infection occurred before the production of adequate neutralizing antibody by the vaccine, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> whether the natural infection that occurred in the patients with prior vaccination did not boost the immune system, but instead trigger a severe manifestation of COVID-19, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> does the compatibility between the inactivated virus in the vaccine and the circulating strains of virus matter in determining vaccine efficacy.\n\n【13】With regard to exposure, it is highly likely that the patients encountered SARS-CoV-2 prior to either the first or second dose of vaccination in the case of the first patient or prior to the first dose in the second patient. It is therefore intriguing to speculate on the interaction between vaccination and the presence of active SARS-CoV-2 in an asymptomatic individual with low-level, high-level, or without preexisting neutralizing antibody. Both patients in this report did not have high levels of the RDP antibody.\n\n【14】Our observations suggest that vaccinations could act in boosting the inflammatory process and reveal the previously asymptomatic COVID-19 illness . COVID-19 signs and symptoms can manifest from the burden of viral replication and amplification, the activation of immune cells followed by the release of proinflammatory cytokines, or the formation of the immune complex  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. We speculate that the exposure of these individuals to homotypic or heterotypic serotype viral infection and vaccine administration renders them susceptible to increased proinflammatory responses, leading to the exaggeration of symptoms.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 A schematic timeline of events showing SARS-CoV-2 exposure, PCR status, vaccine administration, the development of symptoms, inflammation, and the possibility of vaccine-associated disease enhancement (VADE) and enhanced respiratory disease (ERD). Upon the exposure to SARS-CoV-2, inflammation (red line) can occur until the symptom onset. During this period, the inflammation response can be amplified by the presence of VADE or ERD (pink arrow) when the patient had already been exposed to vaccinations (orange arrow).</u>\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 In VADE, the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 leads to asymptomatic infection, which is subsequently followed by vaccination and the development of symptoms. Patients then develop a suboptimal level of neutralizing antibody or increased level of nonneutralizing antibody or both. These lead to the development of VADE or ERD, in which immune response and inflammation are enhanced by the vaccine in previously infected individuals through the abovementioned mechanisms. Abs, antibodies.</u>\n\n【17】Theoretically, vaccines could induce vaccine-associated disease enhancement (VADE), where only suboptimal, nonprotective titers of neutralizing antibodies were produced or proinflammatory T-helper type 2 response was induced. Secondly, enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) could manifest, where pulmonary symptoms are more severe due to peribronchial monocytic and eosinophilic infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Precise mechanisms underlying VADE have not been fully elucidated, but it is thought to occur in infections where cells with Fc receptors are targets of active viral infection and replication. SARS-CoV-2-positive monocytes and B and CD4 T lymphocytes had been detected in postmortem lung tissues. It is also thought that vaccines for viral infections with a high proinflammatory burden, such as RSV and SARS-CoV, are likely to result in VADE. Studies with inactivated SARS-CoV and respiratory syncytial virus vaccines have reported VADE via a Th2 cell response and lung eosinophilic infiltration, which may be worsened in aged hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 severity is primarily thought of as a result of cytokine storm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, and dexamethasone was found to lower 28-day mortality in severe patients receiving oxygen supplementation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Furthermore, antigens that induce nonneutralizing antibodies or insufficient neutralizing antibodies are likely to cause VADE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In vitro experiments demonstrated the enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells mediated with spike protein-specific antibodies in plasma from recovered elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. CoronaVac was reported to not have any observable antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection in macaques after SARS-CoV-2 challenge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>; however, data from human trials are not currently available.\n\n【18】Our two cases suggest that determining whether vaccine recipients are SARS-CoV-2 infected albeit being asymptomatic could be important as vaccine administration could theoretically enhance inflammation and disease progression. VADE adds to the complexities of the sociodemographic and health factors as well as the extreme heterogeneity of individuals and populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. VADE could also greatly affect both the decision-making process by individuals to get the vaccine as well as the decision-making process by governments and policymakers to choose certain vaccines and target certain populations with the limited vaccine doses available. It is therefore imperative to fully determine the risk, burden, and mitigation of VADE in order to increase the success of vaccine uptake 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【19】When an individual is found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, we recommend checking antibody levels prior to vaccination for assessing whether the neutralizing antibody had been sufficiently produced as it is suggested that neutralizing antibodies only mediate ADE at the suboptimal neutralizing concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Alternatively, levels of neutralizing antibody titer should be checked regardless of infection status prior to vaccination. Nonetheless, there is currently a lack of knowledge on the levels of baseline antibody titers and the minimum level of neutralizing antibodies that would confer protection against COVID-19. Studies reported that neutralizing antibodies were detected starting from day 10 and peaked at weeks 3 (IgG) and 4 (IgM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In our patients, vaccinations were performed in less than 3 weeks before the measurement of antibody titers, further strengthening the notion that neutralizing antibodies had not yet been formed optimally, which posed the risk of VADE or ERD. Furthermore, vaccines with a high theoretical risk of inducing VADE or ERD include inactivated viral vaccines, such as CoronaVac, which was given to our patients, which could involve nonneutralizing antigen targets and/or the S protein in nonneutralizing conformations, further providing a range of nonprotective targets for antibodies that could drive additional inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【20】In conclusion, we report two cases of patients developing COVID-19 shortly after vaccination with CoronaVac in which VADE is highly likely. We are currently investigating the relationship between inactivated virus strains in the vaccine and the circulating strains of virus in determining vaccine efficacy. As an increasing number of individuals are being vaccinated, more data are needed on VADE. To date, no clinical markers are in use to distinguish between naturally progressive, severe COVID-19 and VADE in clinical practice. We recommend that current vaccination strategies consider the measurement of neutralizing antibody titers as a guide in ensuring the safest strategy for mass immunization. Fully determining the risk, burden, and mitigation of VADE is warranted in order to increase the success of vaccine uptake. Further studies are needed to investigate the true incidence of VADE on vaccinated individuals as well as on how to differentiate between VADE and severe manifestations of COVID-19 that are unrelated to vaccination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:15:41", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:16:20", "cost": 39.156}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:16:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:15:40"}

It has mainly been used in the treatment of osteoporosis for a variety of causes especially in situations refractory to bisphosphonates or when kidney function is impaired. It is also used in cases of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia. There are many causes of hypercalcemia, but only rarely it is associated with granulomatous diseases such as tuberculous pleural effusion. We report a case of hypercalcemia from tuberculous pleural effusion that was initially admitted with left medium abundance pleural effusion and a serum corrected calcium level of 3.48 mmol/L. The calcium level was successfully normalized within 72 hours of subcutaneous denosumab administration after other interventions have failed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hypercalcemia has often been described in patients with granulomatous disorders, but they are rarely symptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. Among them, pulmonary tuberculosis is the most common cause but less so among extrapulmonary cases. Locally, the incidence has been reported to be around 27.5% among patients with active tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, which is comparable to the incidence rate in the west or a high TB incidence country such as India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Acute treatment of hypercalcemia from any cause includes intravenous volume repletion or hydration, coupled with bisphosphonate, calcitonin, or denosumab, if the hypercalcemia persists despite hydration. The most suitable choice of treatment depends on the patient’s clinical condition, which includes renal function status.\n\n【5】Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts and reduces bone resorption. It has been used for the treatment of hypercalcemia as an alternative to bisphosphonate, especially in patients with reduced creatinine clearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【6】We report a case of hypercalcemia secondary to extrapulmonary tuberculosis successfully treated with denosumab after other interventions have failed to reduce the calcium level.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【8】A 70-year-old male with a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and ischemic heart disease presented to the emergency department with 7-day history of gradual onset of shortness of breath, reduced effort tolerance, and lethargy. On further inquiry, there was loss of appetite for a month, but he denied any accompanying weight loss, and there was also no history of fever or night sweats. He admitted to vague abdominal and back pain that lasted for a week.\n\n【9】At the emergency department, he looked cachexic and dehydrated but was alert to time, place, and person. He was apyrexial with a pulse rate of 88 beats per minute and blood pressure of 131/72 mmHg, but tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation, however, was maintained at 98% on room air. Respiratory examination revealed left-sided stony dullness up to the midzone on percussion with reduced air entry on the same side. Cardiovascular and gastrointestinal examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【10】Chest radiograph confirmed the presence of a left medium abundance pleural effusion .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Left medium abundance pleural effusion.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 summarizes the results of the blood investigations including hypercalcemia with a level of 3.03 mmol/L.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Baseline blood investigation.</u>\n\n【14】He was initially admitted to the ward for treatment with intravenous Augmentin and 0.9% saline hydration for presumed acute-on-chronic kidney injury as we did not have any baseline kidney function, but unfortunately his breathing deteriorated rapidly a day after admission. He became more tachypnoeic, and the arterial blood gases showed type 2 respiratory failure (pH, 7.32; pO<sub>2</sub>, 62 mmHg; pCO2, 50 mmHg; HCO<sub>3</sub>, 20; lactate, 3). In view of the worsening ventilation and his general medical condition, a decision was made to invasively ventilate him in the intensive care unit (ICU). In the ICU, his antibiotic was upgraded to intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam for presumed community-acquired pneumonia with pleural effusion and intravenous 0.9% saline 1000 mls over 24 hours for hydration was maintained.\n\n【15】Echocardiography demonstrated globally dilated severe hyperkinesia of the left ventricle and a severely impaired systolic function with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 20%. Because of this, the fluid balance was closely monitored to minimize the risk of pulmonary congestion.\n\n【16】His urine output remained good with an average of 100 mls/h equivalent to 1.4 mls/kg/h. Unfortunately, despite adequate hydration and a positive balance of 900 mls averaging over 3 days, his serum calcium continued to rise to 3.48 mmol/L.\n\n【17】Intravenous furosemide was also initiated as a forced diuresis measure, which also failed to bring the calcium down.\n\n【18】Further investigations for the cause of the pleural effusion included therapeutic and diagnostic left thoracocentesis, and blood tests for the cause of hypercalcemia were conducted during admission. The results are listed in Table 2.\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Further blood samples sent for investigation of hypercalcemia.</u>\n\n【20】To reduce the calcium, we decided to try him on subcutaneous denosumab at the dose of 120 mg, and his serum corrected calcium gradually improved to 2.40 mmol/L, as depicted in Table 3, after 4 days with no further drop in calcium thereafter.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 Serum calcium level after administration of subcutaneous denosumab.</u>\n\n【22】At day 5, the pleural fluid analysis for rapid mycobacterium liquid culture and sensitivity test came back positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The treatment for tuberculous pleural effusion with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and pyridoxine (2HRZ/4HR) was subsequently commenced.\n\n【23】He was successfully extubated after 10 days in the ICU and was transferred to the general medical ward for further management. Unfortunately, he developed a severe concomitant hospital-acquired pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure that eventually led to multiorgan failure, cardiorespiratory arrest, and death.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Hypercalcemia can rarely be a manifestation of granulomatous disease including pulmonary tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, even rarer in tuberculous pleural effusion as in our case.\n\n【26】Evaluation of hypercalcemia in our patient was suggestive of a parathyroid-independent mechanism of hypercalcemia with elevated level of vitamin D. In normal situations, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is absorbed by the skin from ultraviolet B light which is then metabolised into 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> in the liver by 25-hydroxylase. 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is then catalysed via 1-α\\-hydroxylase to an active form known as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>) which aids in calcium absorption in the gut 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Tuberculosis patients experience dysregulated extrarenal production of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> by activated alveolar macrophages which leads to increased calcium absorption in the gut and thus hypercalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Overproduction of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is a protective mechanism against oxidative injuries due to the nitric oxide burst from granulomatous macrophages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Unfortunately, in some individuals, this protective mechanism has led to a different complication. However, not everyone who suffers from TB would develop hypercalcemia as 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is usually produced in small quantities locally and is not brought to target sites for the regulation of calcium homeostasis. This mechanism has been associated with hypercalcemia in pulmonary TB; however, the underlying cause for hypercalcemia in tuberculous pleural effusion, as seen in our patient, remains uncertain.\n\n【28】A theory has been proposed that hypercalcemia in tuberculous pleural effusion could be secondary to circulating monocytes, which act as a source of 1-α\\-hydroxylase that could convert 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>.

The treatment would always start with adequate hydration and forced diuresis with furosemide followed by bisphosphonates if both measures have failed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Haemodialysis may be required in the event of renal failure and corticosteroids in patients with sarcoidosis or certain neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【30】In our patient, bisphosphonate was not chosen as the first-line treatment because of the persistently low creatinine clearance (CrCl) of <30 mls/min with a serum creatinine of 212 μmol/L and the worry of further deterioration in renal function. Palmer et al. showed that a quarter of patients with baseline renal dysfunction experienced all-grade serum creatinine elevation when the hypercalcemia was treated with intravenous bisphosphonates. The incidence of serum creatinine elevation was statistically higher in those with a CrCl of <30 mL/min compared to those with CrCl ≥30 mL/min 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.

Diagnosing this rare condition is still very challenging in the daily clinical routine. In this report we present a case of a lethal sudden pulmonary tumour embolism in a 71-year-old male patient, who was admitted for elective invasive coronary angiography due to suspected coronary artery disease. The patient had suspected Ormond’s disease and no previous history of tumour burden. Possible diagnostic and treatment options are discussed herein and an overview of the current literature is also presented.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pulmonary tumour embolisms are a rare and in most cases sudden cause of death. First described in 1897 by Schmidt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, many patients present with unspecific symptoms and unknown primary tumours. So far, only reviews of case series have been reported, and a large percentage of such patients end with lethal complications. The pathophysiology is currently not entirely understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In this regard, rapid and effective diagnostic and appropriate treatment strategies are a challenge for clinicians who treat such patients. In recent review articles, several diagnostic algorithms have been discussed. Such algorithms, however, have been developed for the diagnostic work-up of thrombotic embolisms and are therefore not always helpful in patients with carcinoma associated embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. In this context, it is not surprising that fibrinolytic therapy has been unsuccessful in such cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Herein, we present a case of tumour associated embolism in a patient with suspected Ormond’s disease.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 71-year-old patient was admitted to our department for elective coronary angiography due to suspected coronary artery disease. His main complaint was typical angina at moderate exertion (CCS class II). Additionally, he reported swelling in the scrotum and his right leg during the past 6 months. A deep vein thrombosis was ruled out by negative Doppler sonography. A computed tomography (CT) scan on the other hand showed diffuse proliferation of fibrous tissue in the retroperitoneum, compatible with Ormond’s disease . Endoscopic evaluation demonstrated mild gastritis and duodenitis, without further malignant findings. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed preserved left ventricular function and a borderline increase of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure of 35 mmHg. Coronary angiography on the other hand revealed a 2-vessel coronary artery disease, with a 50% stenosis of the left main and mid right coronary artery. In this regard, absence of inducible myocardial ischemia was observed using cardiac dobutamine stress magnetic resonance tomography, and therefore PCI was not performed. In addition, a mild dilatation of the RV was noticed with baseline CMR images. During his hospital stay, however, the patient was found unconscious, centralized, and with apnoea, requiring immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation and admission to our intensive care unit. Echocardiographic examinations revealed akinetic ventricles without pericardial effusion and ECG showed pulseless electrical activity. The patient expired despite prolonged resuscitation. Postmortem autopsy revealed an unexpected diagnosis. Thus, histopathologic work-up showed a squamous cell carcinoma of the right ureter (apT4, apN3, apM1, V1, G2), which infiltrated the pelvis, corresponding vessels, and periurethral tissue and caused metastatic lesions in the vertebral body . In addition, massive embolization of cell conglomerates was observed in the pulmonary vessels causing haemorrhagic infarction of the pulmonary parenchyma .\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Abdominal CT scan illustrating fibrotic, possibly infiltrative changes around the abdominal aorta .</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Squamous cell carcinoma manifestation in the ureteral wall.

(d) Pulmonary vessels with extensive squamous cell carcinoma tumour embolisms and haemorrhagic infarction of the pulmonary parenchyma.</u>\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Pulmonary tumour embolisms remain a rare and in most cases sudden cause of death. Unspecific presentation in symptoms of usually previously unknown primary tumours can prevent both diagnosis and effective treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Possible hypotheses explaining massive tumour cell embolization include infiltration of the veins with tumour cells, which subsequently enter the circulation causing embolism of the pulmonary arteries. Once such neoplastic cells have entered the pulmonary circulation, they may additionally induce the activation of the coagulation cascade. Therefore, an admixture of thrombus and tumour cells is usually present in such cases. In recent autopsy series, breast and liver tumours were associated with intravascular tumour, while cases of stomach, prostate, and lung carcinoma demonstrated such a mixed pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In addition to such intravascular obstructive mechanisms, mural changes resulting in pulmonary hypertension have also been described. Such mechanisms include medial hypertrophy of small arteries and arterioles, fibrointimal proliferation, intimal fibrosis, and disruption of the internal elastic lamina with endarteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In contrast to the classical thromboembolic disease, such proliferative and fibrotic changes usually lead to complete and irreversible occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 5\\]</u>. This may explain why “cor pulmonale” tends to develop earlier and right heart failure symptoms tend to be more severe with tumour embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. Table 1 gives an overview of so far reported tumour-related cases of pulmonary embolism .\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Overview of reported pulmonary tumour embolisms.</u>\n\n【11】Of course the diagnostic work-up of such cases is challenging for the clinician, since no blood tests or imaging modalities are available for diagnosis. Thus, conventional clinical probability scores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> would have computed a score of 0 in our case, indicating a very low risk for pulmonary embolism. In addition, standardized blood tests such as measurement of D-dimers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> probably have low positive and negative predictive value, because baseline tumour activity may lead to false positive and the absence of thrombotic debris within the emboli to false negative results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Plain chest radiographs may be diagnostic in some cases if parenchymal abnormalities, such as fibrotic changes of the lungs, are present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In a case series by Kane et al. however, only one of eight patients has exhibited such parenchymal abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Computer tomography, on the other hand, has been used in only one study, where “multifocal dilatation and beading of peripheral pulmonary arteries” has been described in 3 cases of pulmonary tumour embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The utility of ventilation/perfusion scans to detect symmetric and peripherally localized defects has also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. Pulmonary angiography, which is still considered as the invasive reference standard technique for the diagnosis of thrombotic embolism, exhibits low sensitivity for the detection of tumour embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. Aspiration cytology has also been discussed as a diagnostic alternative but may be difficult to implement in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【12】From a therapeutic point of view, fibrinolytic treatment seems ineffective. One case report has attempted this approach, without ultimate success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As presented in Table 1, some cases, notably atrial myxoma and kidney tumours, have survived due to immediate emergency surgery, which may be a promising alternative in haemodynamic stable patients.\n\n【13】In our case, we followed standard procedures of cardiopulmonary resuscitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However, our patient unfortunately expired before any diagnosis could be made. Retrospective review of echocardiographic and CMR findings of a borderline increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and mild RV dilatation may had been indicative of previous subclinical embolic events. Even though the definitive diagnosis of our case was set postmortem, having been aware of such pathologic findings beforehand would not have much changed our strategy. An interesting aspect of our case was the additional finding of retroperitoneal fibrotic changes on CT indicative of Ormond’s disease. However, retrospective histopathologic work-up showed that these changes were probably related to infiltrative activity of the squamous cell carcinoma, which infiltrated the ureteral wall, periurethral tissue, and probably also the abdominal aorta.\n\n【14】Pulmonary tumour embolisms continue to be clinically challenging in modern medicine. Patient presentation is unspecific and diagnostic options and therapy possibilities remain limited. Further studies are required to establish effective detection and treatment strategies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:48:00", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:52:27", "cost": 266.497}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:52:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:48:00"}

Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is a heterogenic and rare syndrome characterized by the detection of a persistent absolute CD4 T cells count <300 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (or <20% of total T cells) in more than one occasion and no evidence of HIV infection in absence of immunodeficiency or therapy associated with depressed levels of CD4 T cells. We report the case of a 50-year-old man with a multiorgan IgG4-related disease presenting in a temporal association with a profound and symptomatic idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia. Both clinical pictures improved after steroid treatment. Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia has been associated with a number of autoimmune conditions but, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which an association with the IgG4-related disease is reported.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The IgG4-related disease is a fibroinflammatory disease characterized by tumefactive lesions, a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and often, but not always, elevated levels of IgG4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The IgG4-related disease has been described in several organs and tissues: pancreas, biliary tract, salivary glands, periorbital tissue, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, meninges, aorta, breast, prostate, thyroid, pericardium, and skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. Histopathological characteristics are similar in the different organs concerned with this disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>. The pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease is not completely understood; evidences point to both autoimmune and allergic disorders. IgG4 are considered to have a role in tolerance to allergens and in responses to various infections, but their physiologic role is still poorly understood. There are emerging data showing that the IgG4 antibodies in this disease represent a downregulatory response to an unknown primary inflammatory stimulus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Immune-mediated mechanisms may contribute to the inflammatory process of IgG4-related disease. Various genetic conditions have been associated with the disease (HLA serotypes DRB10405 and DRB10401 increase the susceptibility in Japanese population, whereas DQB1-57 mutations are associated with disease relapse in Korean population). Bacterial infections with a molecular mimicry mechanism and autoimmunity are all considered potential initiating mechanisms.\n\n【5】Autoimmunity is widely regarded as the initial immunologic stimulus for the type 2 helper T (Th2) cell immune response that is predominant in IgG4-related diseases. Serum IgG4 from patients with IgG4-related disease binds to the normal epithelia of the pancreatic ducts, bile ducts, and salivary ducts. Potential autoantigens at these sites include carbonic anhydrases, lactoferrin, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, and trypsinogens. However, these autoantibodies are neither specific for IgG4-related disease nor known to be of the IgG4 subclass. Thus, their role in IgG4-related disease is unclear. Autoimmunity and infectious agents may act as potential immunological triggers of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The predominant immune response is Th2, followed by activation of regulatory T (Treg) cells. This characteristic is at variance with what is observed in the other autoimmune diseases in which the function of Treg cells is impaired 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The activation of Treg cells in IgG4-related disease is suggested by the high expression of the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) mRNA in tissue by the infiltrates of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells at affected sites and by the increased number of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in the blood. In addition, interleukin-10, which is produced by Treg cells as well as by Th2 lymphocytes and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), appears to be overexpressed in IgG4-related disease. TGFβ may play a central role in the fibrosis process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Various interleukins, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, are overexpressed in target organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 7, 9\\]</u>. IgG4 and IgE production is enhanced by the Th2 cells response. Th2-related cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 enhance the production of both IgG4 and IgE. In contrast, interleukin-10, interleukin-12, and interleukin-21 shift the balance between IgG4 and IgE, favouring IgG4 production. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the production of IgG4 is enhanced preferentially in the setting of a Th2 cell dominant immune reaction. This selective IgG4 induction is referred to as the modified Th2 response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–9\\]</u>. In this paper we reported the association between a rare disease, the IgG4-related disease, and the idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL), a heterogenic and rare syndrome of unknown etiology characterized by the detection of a persistent absolute CD4 T cells count <300 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (or <20% of total T cells) in more than one occasion and no evidence of HIV infection in absence of immunodeficiency or therapy associated with depressed levels of CD4 T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphocytopenia is a disorder of unknown etiology and it is viewed as a syndrome that likely encompasses different disorders that have in common the reduction of CD4 cell number. There is evidence for increased activation and turnover of CD4 T cells in patients with ICL. Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> found increased levels of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and markers of CD4+ lymphocyte activation in patients with ICL. Apoptosis of CD4+ lymphocyte may be associated with enhanced expression of Fas and Fas ligand. Various other immune disorders have been described in ICL patients, including low CD8+ T cells counts and defective expression of CXCR4 on the surface of CD4+ cells. The alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cell repertoires of ICL patients are highly restricted which may suggest a defect in maturation or differentiation during T cell development and altered tyrosine kinase activity of p56. ICL has been associated with increases in immature or transitional B cells and increased serum of IL-7 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【6】ICL has been associated with a number of autoimmune conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> but, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which it is reported in patients with IgG4-related disease.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【8】On August 2007 a 43-year-old patient presented with the sudden onset of cholestatic jaundice and the radiologic detection of two pancreatic masses, diffuse lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly. To exclude the presence of a lymphoma, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. A biopsy of liver and of a lymph node at the level of hepatic hilum and cholecystectomy were performed. Biopsy of pancreatic mass was attended but, for technical reasons, not successful. Histology showed the presence of chronic cholecystitis with hypertrophic reactive lymphadenitis, fibrosis of the cystic duct with strong intramural inflammatory infiltrate, signs of portal fibrosis, and cholestasis in the absence of alterations of the biliary tract. Consequently, a bile duct-duodenal anastomosis was packed in absence of a conclusive diagnosis.\n\n【9】On March 2008, the patient presented a complex clinical picture including an interstitial pneumonitis by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, Epstein Barr and cytomegalovirus infections, tubulointerstitial nephritis, severe lymphopenia, and marked reduction of CD4 通用删除1(英):<u>(214 cells/μL, Tables 1 and 2)</u>. CT scan showed the presence of three pulmonary nodules (<1 cm), diffuse lymph node enlargement, and enlarged kidneys and spleen. Laboratory showed increased levels of ESR and CRP, hypergammaglobulinemia, positive reuma test and Waaler Rose tests, presence of serum and urinary kappa and lambda light chains, increased beta<sub>2</sub> microglobulin, and circulating C1q immunocomplexes. ANA, anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-bile canaliculi, anti-liver kidney mouse, liver western blot, anti-smooth muscle, pANCA, cANCA, anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-peroxidase were negative. Tests for leishmaniasis, toxoplasma, and HIV were also negative. The bone marrow aspirate excluded lymphoproliferative and parasitic disorders. Renal biopsy showed a tubulointerstitial nephritis with diffuse infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Arteries and arterioles were undamaged. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of CD20, CD3, and CD68. Immunostaining for kappa and lambda light chains documented a polytypic plasma cells population. Direct immunofluorescence was negative for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q, fibrinogen, kappa, and lambda light chains. Subject was treated with glucocorticoids with improvement of the symptoms and lymphopenia.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Main laboratory data.</u>\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Lymphocyte typing of March 2008, before steroids administration.</u>\n\n【12】Three years later, a reduction of the number of the CD4 lymphocytes was once again reported (146/μL, CD4/CD8 ratio equal to 0.8) in conjunction with the onset of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, arthralgia, hemorrhagic rhinitis, multiple caries, and consequent extraction of 10 teeth. After the exclusion of HIV and malignancies (biopsy of an inguinal lymph node, bone marrow biopsy, and PET), an idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia was diagnosed. Nevertheless, only a part of the signs was explained by CD4 lymphocytopenia.\n\n【13】On January 2014, there was the first visit to our outpatient clinic for worsening renal function, hypocomplementemia, and polyclonal increase of IgG. CD4 lymphocytes were in the normal range.\n\n【14】The medical history of obstructive jaundice pancreatic mass and interstitial nephritis, together with a marked elevation of IgG4, was suggestive of a IgG4-related disease. At the time of our observation, ultrasound examinations showed hepatomegaly, increased volume of the kidneys with a mild dilatation of chalices and renal pelvis without signs of urinary tract obstructions, and bilateral enlargement of the submandibular glands. IgG4 were mildly elevated (185 mg/dL), ANA were negatives, and CD4 were in the normal range.\n\n【15】After 3 months of prednisone 50 mg/day, we observed an improvement of the renal function paired with a reduction of inflammation, IgG, and kidneys volume and the disappearance of the dilatation of chalices and renal pelvis.\n\n【16】At the time of the submission of the present case report, the patient, treated with prednisone 5 mg/day, is in remission with stable GFR and normalization of IgG4 and CD4 lymphocytes.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】The involvement of liver (cholestatic jaundice), pancreas (pancreatic masses and lymphadenopathy) and, subsequently, the respiratory system (interstitial pneumonia, lung nodules, and hemorrhagic rhinitis), urinary tract (tubulointerstitial nephritis with polyclonal infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, bilateral hydronephrosis), and salivary glands (bilateral enlargement of the submandibular glands, multiple caries, and consequent teeth extraction) as well as the detection of hypocomplementemia, increased polyclonal IgG and IgG4 subclass, and the rapid improvement of symptoms and laboratory data after steroid therapy are indicative of IgG4-related disease. On the other hand, the history of opportunistic infections such as CMV, EBV, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydia, in absence of HIV and malignancies, is the consequence of the idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia. Only when considered together, the IgG4-related disease and the idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia explain the clinical presentation of the subject.\n\n【19】The HISORT criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> reach a high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (97%) to select subjects with IgG4-related disease. These criteria are based on serologic, radiologic, histopathological, and clinical criteria, including the detection of the type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis, the most common sign of the IgG4-related disease, and the responsiveness to the steroids therapy. In the case reported in this paper, all of these criteria were satisfied with the notable exception of the histologic finding of the pancreas which might have confirmed the autoimmune nature of the disease.\n\n【20】The renal involvement reported in IgG4-related disease is a tubulointerstitial nephritis with polyclonal infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, a membranous nephropathy, and a calicopelvic dilatation secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15–19\\]</u>. Raissian et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> diagnostic criteria for a IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis include (a) elevated serum total IgG or IgG4 levels (>135 mg/dL); (b) plasma cell-rich tubulointerstitial nephropathy with an absolute number of IgG4 plasma cells >10/HPF, obliterative phlebitis, and storiform fibrosis; (c) increased kidney volume with wedge-shaped or patchy lesions; and (d) demonstration of a IgG4-related disease in other organs. All of these criteria were satisfied, except for the presence of IgG4 at renal biopsy which was not evaluated at time of renal biopsy. In this case, hypocomplementemia was present and it is reported in 70% of patients with IgG4-related disease. In contrast to the other subclasses, IgG4 has low affinity for Fc receptors and C1q and thus minimal ability to activate cells or initiate complement activation and has been traditionally considered to play only a limited role in immune activation. Nevertheless, in some circumstances, IgG4 can act as a rheumatoid-factor and binds the Fc portion of other IgG antibodies, in particular IgG4. This interaction occurs between Fc constant domains and may contribute to the molecule’s anti-inflammatory function. Complements levels are a helpful indicator of disease activity in patients with a IgG4-RD and renal disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The simultaneous presence of a tubulointerstitial nephritis and hypocomplementemia is a laboratory feature in IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. What is unique in this case is the description of an association of the IgG4-related disease with the idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia.\n\n【22】The ICL is commonly associated with several autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus systemic, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, Sjogren’s syndrome, polyarthritis/vasculitis, psoriasis, lichen planus, autoimmune vitiligo, Behcet syndrome, and Hashimoto thyroiditis as well as the atopic dermatitis, sarcoidosis, and idiopathic obliterative bronchiolitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which an association between the IgG4-related disease and the ICL is reported. However, the pathophysiology of both the IgG4-related disease and idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is not completely clear. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the common pathway between these diseases and, inversely, the casualty cannot be excluded. Consequently, it may be of interest to investigate further the temporal relationship of the IgG4-related disease and idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia and the exact nature of correlation of the two diagnoses.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Methodological Issues\n\n【24】The present case report describes the clinical history and follow-up of a IgG4-related disease presenting in association with an apparently idiopathic profound and recurrent decline in CD4+ cells. The major limitation of this study is that, despite the fact that both the HISORT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> and Raissian criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> required the bioptic demonstration of IgG4, these data were unavailable in our case.\n\n【25】#### 5\\.

Chronic respiratory disease may be associated with severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We review a case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patient who developed acute breathlessness post COVID-19 infection, also focusing on the diagnostic approach. Case. A 69-year-old gentleman with background history of COPD GOLD D and ischemic heart disease was admitted with severe COVID-19 infection. He required high-flow nasal cannula upon presentation. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) thorax at day 10 of illness revealed moderate organizing pneumonia (OP) with emphysematous changes, without pulmonary embolism. He received oral baricitinib and intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days, which was then followed by tapering prednisolone starting dose of 1 mg/kg/day (60 mg/day) with reduction of 10 mg prednisolone every 3 days. COPD pharmacotherapy was optimized with early utilization of dual bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid was withheld. He underwent inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation and was discharged with home oxygen therapy. Unfortunately, he was re-admitted after 2 weeks with shortness of breath and fever for 3 days. Blood results revealed leucocytosis with raised C-reactive protein. A repeat CTPA showed increase reticulations and crazy paving pattern with reduction in lung volume. Multidisciplinary team discussion concluded it as interstitial pneumonia with COVID-19 OP and fibrosis progression. Prednisolone was stopped and he responded well with antibiotics. A follow-up at 3 months post COVID-19 infection showed improvement of clinical symptoms with radiological resolution of ground glass changes. Conclusion. Corticosteroid inhaler should be cautioned in this case, in view of recent pneumonia and non-elevated serum eosinophil count. These groups of patients should be closely followed up to unmask interstitial lung disease that may present prior to COVID-19 and worsen post-infection. Optimizing pre-existing medical conditions should be the paramount intervention.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors return to their baseline state of health after acute COVID-19 infection, but a proportion of patients experience worsening respiratory symptoms. The complex pathophysiology that happens post COVID-19 infection leads to a wide range of differential diagnoses for COVID-19 survival who presented again with breathlessness. This could be related to their own pulmonary commodities, previous undiagnosed interstitial lung disease, or post COVID-19 infection complications such as pulmonary embolism, organizing pneumonia, and secondary bacterial infection. In this literature, we review a case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patient who developed acute breathlessness post COVID-19 infection, also focusing on the diagnostic approach.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】A 69-year-old gentleman with 120-pack-year smoking history was admitted with RT PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. He has background history of diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and COPD GOLD D. He was on tiotropium and olodaterol inhalers, tablet aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and basal bolus insulin injection.\n\n【6】During the 1<sup>st</sup> admission for COVID-19 infection, he presented with 3-day history of cough and shortness of breath. Clinically, he was tachypnoeic with RR 28 bpm. Arterial blood gas showed type 1 respiratory failure and he required high-flow nasal cannula FiO<sub>2</sub> 0.6 60 L/min. A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive with raised CRP 20 mg/L. Otherwise, white blood cells (WBC) were normal (7 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and other blood tests were unremarkable. Chest radiograph showed bilateral lower zone ground glass opacity. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) thorax on day 10 of illness revealed moderate organizing pneumonia with a background of emphysematous changes and no pulmonary embolism .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The sequences of CT thorax at day 10 of COVID-19 illness (a–c) showed moderate GGO with organizing pneumonia in the background of emphysematous lung (blue arrow). Second CT thorax at day 42 post COVID-19 infection (d–f) showed worsening bilateral ground glass opacity with reticulations and crazy paving pattern (red arrow) most prominent at bilateral lower lobes. There is also reduction in lung volume with displaced fissures (yellow arrow). Third CT thorax at 5 months post COVID-19 infection (g–i) showed significant improvement of GGO with residual reticulations in apical region and lung bases.</u>\n\n【8】He was treated with oral baricitinib and intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days which was then changed to tapering dose of prednisolone with starting dose of 1 mg/kg/day (60 mg/day) and reduction of 10 mg prednisolone every three days. He underwent inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation and was discharged after 22 days of admission with short-term oxygen therapy.\n\n【9】He presented again after two weeks with three-day history of cough and shortness of breath. Clinically, he was febrile with temperature of 38°C. He appeared tachypnoeic with SpO2 92% under room air. Lung examination revealed minimal bi-basal fine crepitations without audible wheeze. There was no pedal oedema and jugular venous pressure was not raised. Blood investigation showed leucocytosis with WBC 16 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and raised CRP 45 mg/L. Other blood investigations including renal profile and liver function test were normal. Sputum and blood culture were negative. A repeated CTPA thorax showed worsening ground glass opacity with reticulations and crazy paving pattern. There was also reduction in lung volume with displaced fissures. Otherwise, there was no organizing pneumonia or pulmonary embolism .\n\n【10】Multidisciplinary team discussion concluded it as post COVID-19 infection with progressive fibrosis and concomitant secondary bacterial infection. He was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g QID. The prednisolone was stopped due to an active infection. Bronchoscopy was not performed as he responded well with the antibiotic therapy. He was discharged after 1 week with long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>\\-agonist (LABA) plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination inhaler and underwent outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\n【11】A follow-up at 3 months post COVID-19 infection showed improvement of clinical symptoms and radiological resolution of crazy paving pattern . His full lung function at 3 months post COVID-19 infection revealed restrictive ventilatory defect with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 1.67 L (72% predicted), forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1.74 L (64% predicted), ratio FEV1/FVC<sub>1</sub> 0.96, total lung capacity (TLC) of 69% predicted, and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 59% predicted. In addition, impulse oscillometry (IOS) showed an elevated difference between resistance at 5 Hz and 20 Hz (R5-R20) of 0.13 kPa/L/S. The presence of restrictive ventilatory defect with IOS results supports the diagnosis of post COVID-19 interstitial lung disease with concomitant COPD with emphysema. At this juncture, we have diagnosed him with resolving interstitial lung disease (ILD) and therefore no definitive treatment for ILD was warranted.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】COVID-19 pneumonia-related dyspnoea is likely to improve over time but may have a protracted course, especially in our patient who has severe pulmonary involvement. The general treatment strategy should address the underlying reasons of dyspnoea, which is often multifactorial. In this case, the probable causes of dyspnoea include exacerbation of COPD, secondary bacteria infection, and post COVID-19 pumonary fibrosis. We have optimized COPD pharmacotherapy with early utilization of dual bronchodilators based on the severity of the symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroid inhaler should be cautioned in this case, in view of recent pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u> and non-elevated serum eosinophil count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Furthermore, it should not be used as a part of triple therapy for the initial pharmacotherapy option. Inhaled corticosteroids have been recently investigated for the potential treatment of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 infection; however, current data are insufficient to support the efficacy in treating acute COVID-19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>.\n\n【14】We prescribed home oxygen therapy for this patient in view of severe hypoxaemia. There was doubtful recovery of the lung function as existing lung abnormalities were further impaired by the recent COVID-19 pneumonia. Elderly patients with pre-existing lung abnormality were associated with prolonged hospital admission and difficulty of weaning oxygen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. American Thoracic Society and British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines recommended severe hypoxaemia to be defined as PaO2 60 mmHg or 7.3 kPa, or SpO2 88% on room air in patients with chronic lung disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. However, a recent study suggested 92% on maximum of 3 L/min oxygen flow as the criteria for discharge with home oxygen for COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The study showed low mortality and re-admission rate in their cohort. Low threshold to prescribe home oxygen therapy in post COVID-19 was a reasonable approach to allow early discharge and preserve limited acute care bed.\n\n【15】Unfortunately, the patient was re-admitted to our centre with worsening symptoms despite dual bronchodilators and home oxygen therapy. This raised the question of the possibility of ongoing organizing pneumonia from resolving the COVID-19 infection and re-introduction of steroid treatment. In a retrospective study of 837 survivors of COVID-19, 5% had evidence of organizing pneumonia, and initiation of corticosteroid treatment resulted in improved symptoms, imaging, and function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, adopting a similar approach in this case should be cautioned as the patient presented with fever and repeat CT scan predominantly showed worsening ground glass changes with the absence of organizing pneumonia features. Furthermore, the CT scan findings should be interpreted with accompanying clinical contexts, as in this case, bacterial infection and patient did improve with broad-spectrum antibiotic. Prescribing prolonged steroid treatment without exclusion of infection would be detrimental and associated with unnecessary steroid toxicity.\n\n【16】Post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is defined as the presence of persistent fibrotic changes identified on follow-up CT scans and associated with functional impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The prevalence was between 9% and 85% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>, and these wide variations were mainly attributed to the timing of the assessment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The risk factors for progression of post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis were related to patient factors and COVID-19 severity, namely, in the present case, age >50 years, significant smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with emphysema, severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and the use of non-invasive ventilation. Furthermore, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the only comorbidity associated with post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Meta-analysis of post COVID-19 infection demonstrated progression of acute viral pneumonitis to parenchyma lung damage and fibrotic changes within three to six months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. However, none of the fibrotic-like changes were described as end-stage lung fibrosis changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Majority of restrictive impairment observed within one and three months among post COVID-19 patients had resolved by 12 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. However, the proportion of patients with abnormal gas transfer remained elevated at the same period. None of these patients were subjected to specific treatments or interventions.\n\n【18】The definite treatment for post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is not completely determined yet. An observational study of early corticosteroid treatment has reported rapid and significant improvement in lung volume and gas transfer in persistent post COVID-19 interstitial lung disease patients (ILD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, there was lack of control group for comparison and the improvements may reflect ongoing natural lung recovery post COVID-19 infection. Anti-fibrotic showed potential inhibition of acute lung injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> and anti-inflammatory properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18–20\\]</u>; however, its safety profile, efficacy, subgroups of patients who would benefit, and the timing for initiation of treatment have not yet been established for COVID-19 patients.\n\n【19】Patients with ILD and a pre-existing risk factor for lung fibrosis as described in our case should be closely followed up after COVID-19 infection for progression of ILD. BTS recommended comprehensive assessments of symptoms, lung physiology, and imaging at 3 months while further serial assessments at 6 months and 12 months were warranted to differentiate those who have resolving and progressive ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. At the present juncture, we have diagnosed him with resolving ILD and therefore no definitive treatment for ILD was warranted. However, we remain cautious of the risk of ILD progression and therefore subsequent follow-up is required as per BTS recommendation.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】The causes of dyspnoea in post COVID-19 patient are often multifactorial. Comprehensive assessments of symptoms, lung physiology, and chest imaging will navigate the differential diagnosis. These groups of patients should be closely followed up to unmask interstitial lung disease that may present prior to COVID-19 and worsen post-infection. Optimizing pre-existing medical conditions should be the paramount intervention while specific treatment for COVID-19 ILD remains experimental at this moment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:01:19", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:01:33", "cost": 13.703}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:39", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:01:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:01:18"}

His thyroid function test confirmed marked hypothyroidism. Severe elevation of serum CK consistent with rhabdomyolysis was noted and an elevated creatinine indicated acute renal impairment. Patient’s condition improved significantly after starting him on thyroid hormone replacement therapy and aggressive hydration. Acute renal impairment with rhabdomyolysis in patients with hypothyroidism is quite rare and we expect that this case report adds to the existing literature on this subject. We also emphasize that thyroid status should be evaluated in patients with unexplained acute renal impairment and presenting with the symptoms of muscle involvement.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The effects of hypothyroidism on the renal function are fairly well established. These effects include histological changes as well as physiological changes. Most notable physiological changes include decrease in renal blood and plasma flow, decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), alterations in water and electrolyte balance especially hyponatremia, and changes in tubular secretory and absorptive capacity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The changes to renal functions are subtle in most patients with hypothyroidism and are often overlooked in clinical setting. Moreover, this association is often inferred when patient’s renal impairment is improved by thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\n【4】Muscle disorders and other muscular manifestations are also common with hypothyroidism. These muscular manifestations may range from mere stiffness, weakness, or elevated creatinine phosphokinase to more serious manifestations such as Hoffman’s syndrome or rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Histological changes in muscles may be observed in hypothyroidism as well. Although the association between muscle disorders and hypothyroidism is well noted, the association of rhabdomyolysis characterized by muscle necrosis and myoglobinuria with hypothyroidism is very rare.\n\n【5】We report the case of a 33-year-old male with hypothyroidism who developed acute renal impairment with rhabdomyolysis. This case report joins the list of the selected few case reports that reported hypothyroid acute renal impairment along with the association of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 33-year-old Caucasian male was transferred to our hospital from outside facility with acute renal impairment. The patient had no significant past medical history other than gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and he was not known to be on any medication. He has history of tobacco use (rubbing and snuffing) for 20 years and drinks 3 cans of beer per week.\n\n【8】Patient presented with the chief complaint of bilateral lower extremities edema and generalized muscle weakness and cramps. These symptoms were noticed two days prior to the admission. Two months prior to the admission, the patient had also complained of tiredness and constipation. He had not been sleeping well at night. He denied being in unusual stress situation. He was also feeling colder than other people around him. Prior to the admission, the patient noted a weight gain of 10 pounds in 2 days. Patient denied any history of seizure, trauma, or fall recently although he mentioned that he had been doing a lot of snow shoveling over the past two weeks before admission.\n\n【9】On presentation, the patient had a body temperature of 36.6°C, pulse of 78 per minute, respiratory rate of 20, and blood pressure of 193/115 mm Hg. The patient was obese with a body mass index of 38.1 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. On physical examination, he was alert and oriented. His conjunctivas were clear and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. An enlarged, rubbery thyroid was palpable. Chest was clear on auscultation bilaterally and S1/S2 was normal with no murmur. Abdomen was soft and nontender. Pitting edema was noted in lower extremities bilaterally with slight muscle tenderness. No evidence of dehydration was found. No lymphadenopathy was noted. No motor or sensory disturbances were noted.\n\n【10】Blood tests showed a creatinine of 1.54 (reference: 0.62–1.27 mg/dL). His GFR was 52 (reference: 59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 13 (reference: 8–26 mg/dL). His CK was 7200 (reference: 48–222 U/L). Sodium was 141 (reference: 136–145 mmol/L), potassium was 4.2 (reference: 3.5–5.1 mmol/L), and chloride was 99 (reference: 96–111 mmol/L). Urine electrolytes were also measured. Fractional excretion of sodium (FE<sub>Na</sub>) was 0.88 pointing towards prerenal cause of renal impairment.\n\n【11】His TSH was 145.7 (reference: 0.3–5.9 lU/mL). TSH with free T4 reflex was 117.13 (reference: 0.3–5.9 μIU/mL) and thyroxine free (free T4) was 0.3 (reference: 0.6–1.1 ng/dL). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody was 150 (reference: 40 IU/mL).\n\n【12】Liver function tests showed an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 148 (reference: 8–48 U/L), alanine transaminase (ALT) of 82 (reference: 7–55 U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 239 (reference: 98–192 U/L). Lipid panel showed cholesterol of 365 (reference: 200 mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of 42 (reference: 39 mg/dL), and triglyceride (TG) of 257 (reference: 150 mg/dL).\n\n【13】White blood cell (WBC) count was 6.9 (reference: 3.5–11 10<sup>3</sup>/μL). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 12 (reference: 0–15 mm/hr). C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.27 (reference: 0.8 mg/dL). B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 20 (reference: 100 pg/mL). Hemoglobin (HGB) was 12.3 (reference: 13.1–17.3 g/dL). Ferritin was 515 (reference: 24–336 ng/mL). Serum iron was 93 (reference: 50–160 μg/dL). Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) was 333 (reference: 260–400 μg/dL). Iron saturation was 28 (reference: 20–50%). Urine analysis was negative for hematuria and proteinuria.\n\n【14】Ultrasound of thyroid showed a small thyroid that was hypoechoic and heterogeneous with diminished vascularity. These findings, although nonspecific, are suggestive of prior episodes of thyroiditis or long standing hypothyroidism. Ultrasound of kidney was unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was within normal limit.\n\n【15】The patient was started on levothyroxine at 125 mcg and aggressive hydration. The patient was initially given IV fluids at a rate of 200 mL/hr for 8 hours in addition to the oral hydration. The fluids were subsequently tapered off. His creatinine decreased to 1.44 mg/dL and his CK decreased to 5409 U/L after a day of treatment. Leg edema and muscle cramps started improving rapidly after a day of treatment. At the time of presentation, the patient was also given IV hydralazine 10 mg to lower his blood pressure. He was subsequently continued on hydralazine 25 mg every six hours to manage his hypertension. Patient’s condition continuously showed improving trend over a 2-day period after which he was discharged.\n\n【16】On follow-up after four months, the patient’s creatinine decreased to 0.9 mg/dL and his GFR was 60 (reference: 59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). His TSH was 0.469 (reference: 0.3–5.9 μlU/mL). TSH with free T4 reflex was 6.22 (reference: 0.3–5.9 μIU/mL). His HGB was 15.3 (reference: 13.1–17.3 g/dL). His AST level was 47 (reference: 8–48 U/L).\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Kidney and thyroid functions are closely interrelated and their interactions have been fairly well established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–9\\]</u>. Thyroid hormones are not only necessary for the growth and development of kidney; they also play a significant role in renal physiology. Hypothyroidism can affect renal hemodynamics and can also induce water and sodium retention leading to hyponatremia. The pathophysiology of renal dysfunction in hypothyroidism is still unclear. Renal impairment with hypothyroidism is thought to be due to reduced cardiac output and increased systemic and renal vasoconstriction leading to reduced renal blood and plasma flow and decreased GFR. Hemodynamic alterations in hypothyroidism, although important, are often subtle and cannot always fully explain the observed renal dysfunction. A study by Den Hollander et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> noted that variations in the blood pressure during thyroid dysfunction are too small to explain the observed changes in renal function. Apart from the effect of hypothyroidism on cardiac output, triiodothyronine (T3) has a direct effect on systemic vascular resistance which can influence renal blood flow directly thus causing renal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Moreover, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels correlate with free T3 and T4 levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, which may affect cardiac output and GFR. Another mechanism that can explain renal dysfunction in hypothyroidism is the influence that thyroid hormones have on tubular secretion of creatinine. Thyroxine (T4) is known to regulate Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>\\-ATPase activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of nephrons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Another important mechanism of renal dysfunction in hypothyroidism is through muscle involvement. Muscle disorders and other muscular manifestations are common with hypothyroidism as creatinine production in muscles is dependent on thyroid status. These muscular manifestations may range from mere stiffness, weakness, or elevated creatinine phosphokinase to more serious manifestations such as Hoffman’s syndrome or rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Acute renal impairment due to rhabdomyolysis induced by hypothyroid state is quite rare and only a handful of case reports are available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–20\\]</u>. This case report adds to this list and presents researchers with adequate data to characterize the rare occurrence of acute renal impairment due to hypothyroidism induced rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【19】Rhabdomyolysis is associated with a wide variety of causes such as seizures, trauma, alcohol and drug abuse, strenuous exercise, drug induced and others. Rhabdomyolysis occurs frequently, but it is usually asymptomatic with abnormalities limited to lab findings. In severe cases, rhabdomyolysis can lead to electrolyte disorders and acute renal failure. There are many factors that can contribute to the development of more severe clinical symptoms in rhabdomyolysis such as hypovolemia, hyperthermia, electrolyte disorders, congenital muscle disorders, and hypothyroidism. As noted before, hypothyroidism is a quite uncommon underlying factor behind rhabdomyolysis that can not only trigger its onset but also affect its severity. In our case, patient’s rhabdomyolysis was triggered by exertion (snow shoveling) and the underlying hypothyroid status exacerbated its severity leading to acute renal impairment. Rhabdomyolysis was evident in our case based on severe elevation of serum CK to 7200 (reference: 48–222 U/L). Although there is no well-established serum CK level at which rhabdomyolysis is pronounced to occur, a concentration of five times the upper limit of the normal value has been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Serum CK levels are also considered to be a predictive measure indicating development of acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>; however, serum CK levels do not correlate with the severity of renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. A creatinine of 1.54 (reference: 0.62–1.27 mg/dL) was noted indicating acute renal impairment. In each of the case reports that reported acute renal failure due to hypothyroidism induced rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–20\\]</u>, improvements were seen in patients after starting thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Cai and Tang 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> reported two patients who also required blood purification. Our patient improved significantly after starting him on thyroid hormone replacement therapy and aggressive hydration.\n\n【20】Our patient had edema in lower extremities bilaterally with slight muscle tenderness. Edema has been associated with thyroid dysfunction as studies suggest that thyroid hormones affect small vessel permeability leading to leakage of albumin from the vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23–25\\]</u>. Decrease in renal plasma flow, GFR, and free water clearance associated with hypothyroidism can also contribute to edema in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Hyponatremia is seen in patients with hypothyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>, but it was not noted in our patient based on normal serum sodium level thus eliminating hyponatremia as the cause of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【21】Hypothyroidism can adversely affect the hematological system and lead to development of anemia. In a study designed to measure the prevalence of anemia in patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism, Mehmet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> found that the frequency of anemia in patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism is statistically more significant than in the healthy control group. They also noted that anemia of chronic disease is the most frequently seen anemia type in patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism. We note that the patient reported here had anemia of chronic disease with elevated Ferritin and normal TIBC with HGB of 12.3. After treatment with levothyroxine, patient’s HGB returned to normal when followed up four months after hospital discharge.\n\n【22】Our patient had an elevated level of TPO antibody indicating chronic autoimmune thyroiditis as the cause of his hypothyroidism. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis has been cited as the most frequent cause of hypothyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【24】In this case report, we report an occurrence of acute renal impairment due to hypothyroidism induced rhabdomyolysis. Acute renal impairment with rhabdomyolysis in patients with hypothyroidism is quite rare and we expect that this case report adds to the existing literature on this subject and provides researchers with adequate data to characterize this disorder further.

Discussion\n\n【11】The overall reported prevalence of amniotic bands in the UK and Western Europe varies between 0.44 to 0.48 (per 10,000 births) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Circumferential congenital constriction band of the abdomen is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>. Some common characteristics of the congenital constriction band of the abdomen have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The constriction band follows a single segment that is higher on the back. The constriction ring may be located above or below the pelvic brim. The depth varies from a shallow groove to a deep gutter and usually extends only up to the first fascial layer.

Some coexisting conditions which cause pain similar to sickle cell disease may go undiagnosed in these patients. We report two adults with concurrent hyperparathyroidism who experienced significant improvement in sickle cell pain following parathyroidectomy thereby pointing to hyperparathyroidism as the principal causative factor for their pain. Meticulous evaluation for parathyroid disorders can be rewarding in sickle cell disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder which affects approximately 100,000 Americans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This disease is characterized by production of an abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) molecule which polymerizes into long chains when deoxygenated. This leads to deformation of red blood cells (RBCs) into their characteristic sickle shape. Vasoocclusion by sickle shaped RBCs and their hemolysis are the hallmarks of SCD. Acute and chronic body pains which are common clinical symptoms in SCD are understood to be due to vasoocclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. All painful events in SCD may not be sickle cell related. Other systemic disorders including some endocrine disorders like hyperparathyroidism which commonly cause musculoskeletal pain may present concurrently with SCD. Here we report two patients with concurrently occurring hyperparathyroidism who experienced amelioration of sickle cell pain following parathyroidectomy. There is a prior case report of primary hyperparathyroidism mimicking vasoocclusive crises in a pediatric patient with homozygous sickle cell (HBSS) disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our case report exemplifies that the benefit of decrease in painful episodes following treatment of hyperparathyroidism may be seen in other genotypes like sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia. We also report a similar benefit following treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism due to end stage renal disease occurring concurrently in a patient with HBSS disease.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】Baseline characteristics of the two patients at the time of diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Hb: hemoglobin, HPLC: high performance liquid chromatography, HbS: sickle cell hemoglobin, HbF: fetal hemoglobin, HbA and HbA2: adult hemoglobin, and PTH: parathyroid hormone.</u>\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Case Report 1\n\n【8】Our first case is a 59-year-old female patient who moved to USA from Haiti two years ago with a diagnosis of sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia. She reported having generalized pain almost on a daily basis which she managed at home with pain medications. She had frequent hospital visits for generalized painful crises as many as twice a month of which some required inpatient treatment. We analyzed her case in detail after one such prolonged admission for 15 days especially as the severity of her presentations for painful crises was unusual given her sickle cell genotype.\n\n【9】High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) showed HbA of 22.4%, HbA2 of 7%, HbS of 65.4%, and HbF of 5.2% consistent with a diagnosis of sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia. Hemogram showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 4.3, Hb of 9.8 grams/deciliter (g/dL), and platelet (Plt) count of 158. Blood chemistry was significant for elevated calcium (Ca) on multiple occasions with a peak of 12.7 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL). Phosphate was low on multiple occasions with a nadir of 1.9 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was elevated on multiple occasions with a peak of 147 picograms/milliliter (range 14–72 pg/mL). Vitamin D levels ranged from 18 to 23 nanograms/milliliter (range 30–100 ng/mL). Based on the above investigations we reached a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).\n\n【10】Patient underwent imaging studies to localize the parathyroid lesion. Radionuclide parathyroid imaging using technetium sestamibi scan revealed slow washout in the right mid thyroid region  and computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck without contrast revealed a soft tissue mass posterior to mid pole of the right thyroid lobe  both favoring a diagnosis of adenoma of the right inferior parathyroid gland. She also had intermittent upper abdominal pain which was confirmed on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to be due to severe gastritis.\n\n【11】Patient underwent focused parathyroidectomy of the right inferior parathyroid gland which was confirmed on histopathologic examination to be a parathyroid adenoma. Intraoperative PTH monitoring was not used in this case. Patient’s calcium and PTH levels normalized following surgery and are shown in Figures 1 and 2. At 6-month follow-up calcium level was 9.7 mg/dL and PTH was 28.4 pg/mL confirming cure of PHPT. Following successful treatment of PHPT, she has not had any sickle cell related painful events and has not required emergency room (ER) visits or hospitalizations over the last year.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Perioperative PTH monitoring, POPTH (postoperative PTH), and Pg/mL (picograms/milliliter).</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Perioperative calcium monitoring, POCa (postoperative calcium), and Mg/dL (milligrams/deciliter).</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Radionuclide parathyroid imaging using technetium Tc-99m sestamibi showingslow washout in the right mid thyroid region (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 CT scan of the neck without contrast showing a soft tissue mass posterior to mid pole of the right thyroid lobe (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【16】##### 2.2. Case Report 2\n\n【17】Our second case is a 26-year-old male patient with homozygous sickle cell (HBSS) disease. He also had chronic kidney disease which progressed over 3 to 4 years to end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. Patient had frequent presentations for painful crises amounting to 16 ER visits and 82 inpatient days in the preceding year at our institution. His painful crises were notably more frequent since he developed ESRD and were localized in his hips and collar bones.\n\n【18】Most recent HPLC showed HbA of 81.8%, HbF < 1%, HbA2 of 2.7%, and HbS of 14.5% indicating that patient had recently received multiple blood transfusions. Hemogram showed WBC count of 12, Hb of 7.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 333. Blood chemistry was significant for elevated Ca on multiple occasions with a peak of 11.8 mg/dL. Phosphate was high on multiple occasions with a peak of 9.1 mg/dL. PTH was elevated on multiple occasions with a peak of 4078 pg/mL. Vitamin D levels ranged from 13 to 20 ng/mL. Predialysis blood urea nitrogen ranged from 60 to 80 mg/dL and creatinine ranged from 8 to 10 mg/dL. Patient was treated with cinacalcet for secondary hyperparathyroidism but became refractory to treatment after a period of time with persistently elevated calcium and PTH levels. Based on the above investigations, we reached a diagnosis of tertiary hyperparathyroidism due to ESRD.\n\n【19】Imaging studies were done to localize the parathyroid lesion. Radionuclide parathyroid imaging using technetium sestamibi scan showed slow washout in the right lower thyroid region  but CT scan of the neck with contrast showed moderately enhancing foci inferior to the left and right thyroid lobes and superior to the left thyroid lobe which raised suspicion of parathyroid hyperplasia and warranted exploration of all four parathyroid glands. Plain radiography revealed bony resorption typical of untreated hyperparathyroid bone disease at the greater trochanters of both femoral bones and lateral ends of both clavicles which were the locations of his pain .\n\n【20】Four-gland exploration and parathyroidectomy were performed and a portion of one gland was reimplanted in the left sternohyoid region. Histopathology showed parathyroid hyperplasia of all the resected glands. Intraoperative PTH monitoring was used as shown in Figures 5 and 6. At 6-month follow-up calcium level was 9.1. Since this patient underwent parathyroidectomy, his frequency and severity of painful crises have decreased significantly. He has had only 3 ER visits and a total of 8 inpatient days for painful crises in the year following parathyroidectomy which is significantly lower than before the surgery.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Perioperative PTH monitoring, IOPTH (intraoperative PTH), POPTH (postoperative PTH), and Pg/mL (picograms/milliliter).</u>\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 Perioperative calcium monitoring, IOCa (intraoperative calcium), POCa (postoperative calcium), and Mg/dL (milligrams/deciliter).</u>\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 Radionuclide parathyroid imaging using technetium Tc-99m sestamibi showingslow washout in the right lower thyroid region (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8 Bony resorption of greater trochanters of both femoral bones typical of untreated hyperparathyroid bone disease at the locations of the patient’s pain (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 9 Bone resorption of the lateral ends of both clavicles (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【26】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【27】Vasoocclusive episodes in SCD involve multiple organs with musculoskeletal system being most commonly affected. Some patients have acute generalized body pain while others have localized bony pain resulting from bone infarcts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The long bones are most commonly affected followed by ribs, sternum, and vertebral bodies. The pain may range from mild to very severe. Many individuals with SCD also suffer from long term consequences of vasoocclusive pain episodes in the musculoskeletal system, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral heads or collapsed vertebral bodies. This leads to a chronic state of pain in addition to the more acute painful episodes. Pain symptoms are a major cause of morbidity and affect quality of life in these patients. These symptoms result in multiple ER visits and hospitalizations. They are managed with pain medications, intravenous fluids, and blood transfusions as needed along with treatment of the underlying trigger. SCD may be associated with endocrine disorders like hyperparathyroidism which also cause generalized body pains. It is important to identify and treat these disorders for an optimal outcome and not to dismiss all pain symptoms in these patients as being due to SCD.\n\n【28】Hyperparathyroidism may be primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is due to oversecretion of PTH most commonly from a parathyroid adenoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Most new patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis with PHPT. Biochemical tests that include measurement of serum calcium currently account for identification of at least 80 percent of patients with PHPT in western countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The classical symptoms of PHPT are due to combined effects of increased PTH and calcium. Complaints of weakness and fatigue are common among patients with PHPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Other manifestations include nephrolithiasis, bone disease, constipation, polyuria, and polydipsia. There is a wide spectrum of involvement of the skeletal system in hyperparathyroidism. Effects can range from generalized bone pains to asymptomatic patients with decreased bone densitometry and increased risk of fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism occur in patients with chronic kidney disease. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by severe parathyroid hyperplasia with autonomous secretion of PTH that is no longer adequately responsive to the plasma calcium concentration. This causes high bone turnover and abnormal mineralization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Musculoskeletal symptoms from hyperparathyroidism can be difficult to distinguish from those in patients with concurrent SCD.\n\n【29】There are variations in clinical presentation among the different sickle cell genotypes with homozygous HBSS disease and heterozygous sickle cell-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia patients being the more severely affected ones. In HBSS disease fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a major modulator of polymerization in that the higher the HbF levels, the more benign the clinical and hematologic features of sickle cell anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Some heterozygous sickle cell variants like sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia and HBSC disease generally have a more benign clinical course. In sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia, normal adult hemaoglobin (HbA) accounts for 18 to 25 percent of total hemoglobin which prevents extensive polymerization. Similarly, in HBSC disease, HBC hemoglobin does not participate in polymerization. Therefore, in both these variants painful events occur at less than half the freuency as the HBSS type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Our first patient with sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia was having more frequent painful episodes than expected for her genotype. This prompted us to investigate for other coexisting illnesses and we reached a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The marked improvement in her pain symptoms following resection of the parathyroid adenoma made it clear that hyperparathyroidism had been partially responsible for the pain symptoms.\n\n【31】Our second patient with HBSS disease and ESRD received multiple transfusions for symptomatic anemia not responding to erythropoietin. Though his HbA was >80%, he did not have the benign course in terms of painful events which would be expected with low HbS levels of 14.5%. This led us to evaluate for other coexisting pathologies for his musculoskeletal pain. There were radiological features of untreated hyperparathyroid bone disease at the locations of his pain. There was bone resorption of greater trochanters of both femoral bones and lateral ends of the clavicles but there were no bone infarcts or avascular necrosis of the femoral heads as would be anticipated in SCD . These radiological findings along with analysis of the case as described above led to our conclusion that hyperparathyroidism was more likely than SCD to be the cause of his frequent painful episodes.\n\n【32】Patients with phenotypic manifestations which are incongruous with their genotype, that is, more severe and frequent pain symptoms in a milder sickle cell variant, should be investigated for concurrent systemic disorders which can contribute to their pain. Similarly frequent or persistent painful episodes despite relatively normal markers of active sickle disease like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reticulocyte count, and bilirubin should also prompt further investigations. Notable findings in our first patient include LDH, reticulocyte percentage, and bilirubin levels which stayed at baseline during painful events over a 22-month period which is unlike that seen in sickle cell crises .\n\n【33】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 10 Graphs showing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reticulocyte percentage, and total bilirubin levels in the first patient.</u>\n\n【34】The improvement in sickle cell pain in our two patients following parathyroidectomy points towards hyperparathyroidism being the predominant cause of their pain. Further studies need to be done to see if there is a potential causal relationship between the two conditions. There are other potential benefits of treatment of hyperparathyroidism in patients with SCD. Patients with SCD have a high rate of vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Concurrent hyperparathyroidism causing a high bone turnover may worsen osteoporosis in patients with SCD. Treatment of hyperparathyroidism in appropriate cases with parathyroidectomy will help prevent long term bone damage. In addition it is expected that there will be an improvement in muscle strength following parathyroidectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. There may also be an added benefit in preventing opioid dependence in this subset of patients whose pain is commonly attributed to sickle cell disease.\n\n【35】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【36】Hyperparathyroidism can occur concurrently with sickle cell disease and can cause symptoms which mimic sickle cell painful events.

A computed tomogram (CT) revealed that third sacral lamina was fractured and displaced into the spinal canal, but vertebral body did not displace. The fracture lines began at the center of lamina and extended bilateraly. The fracture pattern was unique. The sacrum was osteoporosis, and this fracture may be based on osteoporosis.

One year after surgery, he returned to a normal daily life and had no complaints regarding urination. One-year postoperative CT showed the decompressed third sacrum without displacement.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The sacrum is a large, triangular bone that connects the spine and pelvis through which sacral nerve roots run. Treatment of sacral fractures is based on the radiographic fracture pattern and neurological deficit. Denis and his colleagues classified sacral fractures into three types on the basis of the incidence of neurological injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Zone I fractures involve the ala of the sacrum to the lateral border of the neural foramen. Zone II fractures involve the neural foramen, and Zone III fractures involve the central portion of the sacrum. The incidence of neurological damage in patients with Zone III sacral fractures has been reported to be 56.7%, of which 76.1% patients developed bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunctions. A series of sacral fractures have been reported till date, but case reports are few and details of sacral fracture remain unclear. Here, we report the details of radiological findings and therapeutic course for a patient with a Denis Zone III sacral fracture.\n\n【4】The patient gave consent to submit data for publication.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 76-year-old man was hit from behind by a car and admitted to the hospital. He complained pain in the sacral area. After admission, he faced difficulty with urination and developed perineal numbness.\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Neurological Examination\n\n【8】Neurological examination showed that his muscle power was normal in lower extremities and his ankle jerk decreased. Sensory disturbance was detected on the perineal region. His urinary retention was severe, sense of bladder urgency was lost, and defecation and bulbocavernosus reflex were normal. His urinary tract was not damaged. We diagnosed neurogenic bladder dysfunction. All laboratory findings were within normal limits.\n\n【9】##### 2.2. Radiological Findings\n\n【10】A sagittal reconstructed computed tomogram (CT) revealed that the third sacral lamina was fractured and displaced into the spinal canal. The posterior part of the third sacral vertebral body became hollow, but the sacral vertebral body did not displace . An axial reconstructed CT revealed that the third sacral lamina was fractured bilaterally. The cortex of sacrum was thin. The trabeculae of the third sacral body were sparse . These appearance suggested osteoporosis. A three-dimensional CT revealed oblique fracture lines, which began at the center of the third sacral lamina and extended bilaterally . The fracture lines were unique, and we suspected the fragility fracture based on osteoprosis. The fracture involved Zone II and III. In relevance to clinical symptoms, we diagnosed Denis Zone III sacral fracture. The vertebral body did not displace, and so we determined that this fracture was stable. Our operation plan was a decompression surgery without stabilization procedure. Sagittal planes of magnetic resonance imaging showed signal changes in the sacral vertebral bodies. The third, fourth, and fifth sacral vertebral bodies showed low intensities on T1- and T2-weighted images . We interpreted these findings as microfracture.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Preoperative reconstructed computed tomogram (CT).

According to a textbook about the spine, dedicated CT is useful for evaluation of sacral fractures; however, three-dimensional reformed CT add little additional insight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the present case, three-dimensional CT clearly revealed the fracture lines and we planed the operation on the basis of fracture pattern. Therefore, we recognized the usefulness of three-dimensional CT in the examination of sacral fractures.\n\n【24】According to Fisher, Gibbons, and Zelle, bladder function recovered completely in some cases of sacral fractures, although the time in which it recovered has not been mentioned in their reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. In the present case, bladder function recovered completely in three months because the patient had a simple fracture. The time to recover bladder function in cases of severe sacral fracture may take more than three months.\n\n【25】The treatment of sacral fractures is based on fracture pattern and neurological status. There have been some reports that neurological status improved by both surgery and conservative treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 9–13\\]</u>. Treatment in cases of sacral fractures with neurological symptoms remains controversial. In the present case, a stable sacral fracture with neurological deficit was diagnosed.

We report to the best of our knowledge the first case of infantile scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumor in a 6-month-old male baby who presented with a right parietal scalp mass since the age of 1 month. This mass was initially diagnosed as scalp hemangioma based on clinical and imaging findings. However, this mass was growing fast which necessitated excision. Pathologic examination after excision showed a malignant tumor composed of sheets of rhabdoid cells. Immunohistochemically, this tumor tested positive for vimentin, CD 99, glypican-3, synaptopysin, WT-1, CK, and EMA. INI-1 immunostain was lost in the tumor cells. Subsequently, this tumor was pathologically diagnosed as extracranial scalp rhabdoid tumor. After tumor excision, the patient was referred to pediatric oncology to receive chemotherapy. Experience with scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumors is limited. However, this tumor in other organs carries a grave prognosis.

After surgical excision and pathologic diagnosis, the patient was referred to pediatric oncology for treatment. Given the rarity of malignant extracranial rhabdoid tumor, standardized treatment protocols have not yet been popularized worldwide.

The accident might have occurred when the patient’s fingers stuck to the skin of the snake when he grasped the neck of the snake to inspect its mouth and nostrils for symptoms and signs of infection. After inspection, the patient attempted to release the snake back into the snake box, and it then turned its head around and bit the patient’s hand while he was releasing it.

Fortunately, there were no blisters, hemorrhagic bullae, or finger ischemia. The patient also received two courses of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on days 3 and 4, and the swelling of the hand quickly subsided after that. Then, the patient’s fingers were able to bend slightly on the third night and were able to bend more than 90° on day 4. During hospitalization, the patient’s daily stool was soft or fluid and dark blue-green but not black, whereas the urine color was normal. The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 5, and on day 8, a large area of elevated red skin rash and itching of the body occurred at home. After administration of antihistamines, the symptoms disappeared. The patient still sometimes experienced mild numbness and painful sensations at the bite site for up to one month after the snake envenomation.\n\n【11】#### 3\\.

The patient in this case was initially administered 4 vials of antivenom. However, the subsequent redness and swelling continued to worsen, extending over the wrist joint, and therefore, another 4 vials were administered.

We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a bony avulsion injury, which was presumed to have arisen from the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament but turned out instead to be an osteochondral avulsion fracture of the femoral origin. This unexpected finding that was not detected during preoperative workup resulted in the first attempt at surgical fixation being aborted. The need for a second planned definitive fixation procedure emphasises the importance of combining a thorough history and examination in association with appropriate imaging in the patient workup. The patient’s definitive operative treatment and outcome are described. Although rare, surgeons (and emergency room doctors) treating such patients should include femoral end avulsion injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament in the differential diagnosis of a child presenting with an acute haemarthrosis of the knee. Furthermore, once diagnosed, early onward referral to an experienced knee surgeon is advocated.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In the skeletally immature because ligamentous structures are stronger than their osseous attachments, intrasubstance ligament injuries are rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>; therefore, in the context of the paediatric knee, injuries that stress the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) usually result in chondral or osteochondral avulsion fracture, characteristically from the tibial attachment of the ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, resulting in a tibial spine avulsion fracture. By comparison, avulsions of the ACL from the femoral origin are rare, and to date only nine other cases of femoral end avulsion injuries of the ACL have been reported in the English-speaking literature. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a femoral ended osteochondral avulsion injury of the ACL. Despite their rare occurrence, femoral end avulsions of the ACL should be included in the differential diagnosis of a child with an acute haemarthrosis of the knee.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 11-year-old male patient presented to our institution after sustaining trauma to his left lower extremity. On the day of presentation, there had been high winds in the vicinity resulting in the corrugated iron roof of a garage he had been walking nearby blowing off and landing on his left leg. The patient was trapped under the sheet of metal until freed by attending paramedics. In the emergency department, primary and secondary survey assessments of the patient revealed injuries to the knee and distal fibula only. A full formal examination of the knee was not possible due to pain and a tense haemarthrosis. Subsequent plain radiographs revealed an intra-articular avulsion fracture , as well as fracture of the distal fibular diaphysis. A working diagnosis of displaced tibial spine avulsion fracture was made, and the patient was scheduled for surgery the following day to assess and fix the injury. Examination under anaesthesia revealed a ten-degree block to neutral extension of the knee and a positive Lachmann test with a soft end point. Arthroscopic examination of the knee revealed a lesion at odds with the preoperative diagnosis of tibial spine avulsion. A femoral end osteo-chondral avulsion fracture of the ACL was revealed . Due to the unexpected findings and uncertainty about the optimal method of fixation in a skeletally immature patient, the fragment was reduced back into its normal position, the arthroscopic portals were closed, and the knee was splinted in extension in a plaster of Paris splint. With the benefit of hindsight, the treating team acknowledged that if a bone fragment this large had been avulsed from the tibial insertion of the ACL, this should have been reflected in the architecture of the tibial spine footprint on the preoperative X-ray. But as the appearances of this region appeared normal, this avulsion was unlikely to have occurred from the tibial end of the ACL, rather occurring from the less common femoral origin. A CT scan was subsequently obtained , and the literature was scrutinised to aid preoperative planning of definitive fixation. Subsequent definitive fixation was perfomed nine days following the index procedure using a part arthroscopic and part open approach. Initial arthroscopic manoeuvres (including the use of a direct anterior portal in addition to the two standard portals) involved gentle curettage of the residual crater over the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle from where the ACL had been avulsed. Then two 2.4 mm Beath pins were passed in transosseous manner from the lateral supracondylar ridge into the centre of the defect (crossing the physis) using a posterior cruciate ligament targeting guide. 2 loops of 1 PDS suture were passed via these tunnels from the outside of the knee to the centre of the defect. Then a medial parapatellar approach to the knee joint was performed to formally expose the knee, two No. 2 Vicryl Bunnell sutures were passed across the femoral end of the ACL, and these sutures were placed into the PDS loops that had previously been passed into the knee. Pulling on the PDS sutures allowed the No. 2 Vicryl sutures to be passed through the tunnels previously drilled with the Beath pins and to be delivered to the lateral supracondylar ridge of the femur. The sutures were then tied to one another over a bone bridge thereby reducing the avulsed fragment back into its normal anatomical position . Postoperatively, the patient was splinted in extension for the first four weeks. At this stage, the patient was placed into a range of motion knee brace (allowing up to sixty degrees of flexion) and allowed to partially weight bear with crutches. At six weeks following surgery, the patient’s brace was slackened to allow a full range of motion. Radiographs performed nine weeks following definitive fixation showed union of his fracture . He was allowed to ambulate free of his brace at this stage. At six-month follow up, the patient was able to ambulate without walking aids with a normal gait pattern and had a negative anterior drawer and Lachmann test and full restoration of knee flexion. No deformity or leg length discrepancy was noted at this follow up interval.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Anteroposterior and (b) lateral views of the patient’s knee depicting an intra-articular fracture fragment. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Intraoperative arthroscopic images depicting (a) an empty lateral wall of the intercondylar notch resulting from an osteochondral avulsion fracture of the femoral end of the ACL and (b) an arthroscopic hook reducing the fragment (outlined by black dots) to its normal position. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | CT scan depicting (a) sagittal and (b) axial views of the patients knee depicting the avulsed osteochondral fragment. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Schematic diagram depicting the method of repair. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | (a) Anteroposterior and (b) lateral views of the patients knee at three-month follow up. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Epidemiologically femoral end avulsions of the ACL may be subdivided into either purely cartilaginous avulsions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u> or osteochondral avulsion injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–11\\]</u>, the latter being found in our patient whose case we have presented in this article. Furthermore, femoral end avulsion injuries may occur in isolation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4, 7, 9–11\\]</u> (as seen with the child we treated), simultaneously with a tibial end avulsion as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>, and also in tandem with a tibial end avulsion with a significant gap of time between the two injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The youngest patient to have sustained such an injury was three years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The last two of these reports differed in their length of follow up with the latter reporting good outcome at 13-year follow up (as opposed to 10 weeks in the former report) with only slight laxity of the ACL. Almost universally these injuries occur as a result of relatively high-energy mechanisms as was the case with our patient.\n\n【13】Robinson and Driscoll 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> were the first group to report such an injury where it was seen in conjunction with a simultaneous avulsion of the tibial end of the ligament as well. The first report of an isolated avulsion of the femoral origin of the ACL was reported by Eady et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Tohyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a case of consecutive avulsion fractures involving the ACL in which a tibial-sided avulsion fracture was successfully treated and was followed 35 months later by a second injury in which the femoral attachment of the ACL was avulsed.\n\n【14】Our technique of repair was in essence similar to that described by Robinson and Driscoll 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> with our transosseous tunnels for passage of the sutures attached to the femoral end of the ACL crossing the physis. As noted in the article by Corso and Whipple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, concerns have been raised in treating such injuries using transosseous tunnels which cross the physis. In the report by Robinson and Driscoll 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> whose tunnel configuration we also utilised, the authors, however, reported no resulting distal femoral deformity. To counteract possible iatrogenic growth disturbance from transphyseal methods of ACL fixation, transepiphyseal methods of fixation have been advocated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The technically demanding nature of this method of fixation mandates that surgery be performed by soft tissue knee surgeons with expertise in the treatment of ACL injuries in the skeletally immature.\n\n【15】In summary, the case presented in this paper illustrates the pitfalls that may be encountered when treating children presenting with acute injuries to the knee.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:26:31", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:26:55", "cost": 24.07}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:26:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:26:31"}

The largely nonspecific symptoms and delayed presentation pose a serious diagnostic challenge. Medical management with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is recommended, but there are no reports of successful dual therapy. We report a case of spontaneous bilateral vertebral artery dissections (VADs) treated with both anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy and a literature review on clinical presentation and the current medical and surgical management options. A 37-year-old healthy female presented to the emergency department with worsening neck pain and headache for two weeks despite over-the-counter medication, block therapy, yoga, and deep tissue neck massage. She denied any trauma but admitted to multiple roller coaster rides over the past few months. CT angiography was concerning for VADs, and MRI brain revealed multiple strokes in the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory. Cerebral arteriography confirmed the diagnosis of VADs. The patient was initiated on warfarin, along with atorvastatin and aspirin. She was discharged home with no complications and followed up with neurology as an outpatient. MR angiography after three months revealed complete resolution of the dissection. The patient did not report any bleeding complications from dual therapy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cervical artery dissection presents at any age, with a wide range of symptoms. Although uncommon in the general population, it is a recognized cause of ischemic stroke in younger patients. The internal carotid artery is most commonly affected, but occasionally, other arteries can be involved as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The incidence of vertebral artery dissection is estimated to be 2.6–3/100 000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. According to Schievink, bilateral VAD accounts for 10 to 25% of all causes of ischemic stroke in young patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Bilateral VAD may be fatal due to the potential compromise of the posterior cerebral circulation.\n\n【4】Early diagnosis is crucial to achieve better outcomes, especially when the presentation is vague or asymptomatic. Headaches, neck pain, and dizziness are common complaints seen in young to middle age individuals presenting to outpatient clinics and emergency centers. These symptoms can be attributed to benign conditions such as migraine, tension headaches, and myofascial or musculoskeletal pain; therefore, the diagnosis of VAD is frequently missed or misdiagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A common theme amongst VAD is patients with recent minor neck trauma or maneuvers damaging the underlying cervical vessels, including chiropractic manipulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The VAD diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion combined with various imaging modalities. Therefore, this case would be of high interest to both general practitioners and emergency medicine physicians, who most frequently deal with unspecific head and neck pain. Management of VAD depends on several factors including clinical presentation, time of onset, anatomic findings, number of vessels compromised, and contraindications to specific therapies. Therapeutic options include thrombolysis, conservative management with antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents), endovascular management, and surgery. Timely diagnosis and initiation of treatment can help prevent more serious complications. Prognosis appears promising, as recurrent dissection rate after the first month is approximately 1% per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We report the case of a young female who presented 2 weeks after initiation of neck pain. The diagnosis of VAD and multiple strokes was made. We highlight our management approach and outcome. Additionally, we present a review of literature on the most common clinical presentations and management options available to date.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 37-year-old Caucasian female with a history of dyslipidemia, asthma, and fibroids presented to the emergency room reporting two weeks of bilateral posterior neck pain and headaches. She initially presented with right-sided neck pain, which she attributed to various physical activities and sleeping in uncomfortable hotel beds. Of note, she described multiple recent visits to a theme park and enjoyed numerous roller coaster rides. The pain was achy, constant in nature, extending to the back of the eyes, and rated as 4 on a 10-point scale. Her pain persisted and increased in severity despite acetaminophen use and application of heating pads. She then tried block therapy, yoga, and deep tissue neck massage. The pain then became bilateral, even more severe, followed by an episode of severe dizziness and nausea which prompted the emergency room visit. Her family history was negative for connective tissue diseases. The patient was taking oral contraceptive pills and had discontinued statin therapy a few years ago. She denied using tobacco products, illicit drugs, or excessive alcohol.\n\n【8】Initially, vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam revealed a nontoxic appearing young woman in no visible distress. Neck exam was significant for muscular tenderness but no midline or cervical spinous process tenderness. There was no rigidity, with full active and passive range of motion without pain. Brudzinski and Kernig signs were negative. The ear canals showed no abnormalities; there were no hearing deficits. No carotid bruits were present, and the neck was supple. Neurological exam revealed a normal cranial nerve exam, +5/5 muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities symmetric bilaterally, normal sensory exam, normal finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing, and no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was intact, and she had no dysarthria or nystagmus.\n\n【9】Based on her history of recent roller coaster rides, worsening neck pain after yoga, and deep tissue neck massage, the following differential diagnosis was considered: intracranial bleeding, stroke, cervical artery dissection (CAD), and cervical spondylosis. Complete blood count and urinalysis were unremarkable. Basic metabolic panel showed abnormal cholesterol levels (total cholesterol: 224 mg/dl, triglycerides: 168 mg/dl, and LDL: 131 mg/dl). Beta-HCG was <2, and troponins were negative. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm. Autoimmune and vasculitis workup showed an elevated sedimentation rate of 27 mm/hr \\[0–22 mm/hr\\] but negative antinuclear antibodies, Smith antibody, and RNA antibody. Rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein were within normal limits.\n\n【10】Chest X-ray was unremarkable. CT head/brain without IV contrast showed nonspecific left cerebellar hypodensities that may represent age-indeterminate embolic infarcts/injuries among other possible etiologies, with no acute intracranial hemorrhage . Head MRI without contrast (DWI sequence) showed large areas of acute ischemia in the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory with additional smaller areas of acute ischemia in the left superior parasagittal cerebellum. CT angiography of the head and neck with and without IV contrast demonstrated a relatively abrupt change in the caliber of the left V3 vertebral artery suggestive of dissection and a short segment high-grade narrowing of the right vertebral artery also highly suggestive of a dissection . Carotid arteries were within normal limits. Twenty-four hours after admission, the patient presented with a second episode of dizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and tingling sensation in both hands, which prompted further evaluation with the cerebral angiogram. The exam confirmed the bilateral VAD and revealed the presence of a subintimal clot on the left VA at V4 with loss of 50% of lumen , not previously observed in previous images.

Upon diagnosis of bilateral VADs, all consultants unanimously recommended systemic anticoagulation for 3–6 months and repeat imaging in 3 months to evaluate for healing. The patient was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy given the time of presentation and NIHSS of 0. Intravenous heparin at 1,000 units/hr without initial bolus and close monitoring was preferred over standard therapy due to the high risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Additionally, aspirin and atorvastatin were also started. The patient developed mild vaginal bleeding upon discontinuation of birth control pills. The episode stopped shortly after and no interventions were needed. Mirena intrauterine device was recommended should the bleeding worsen while on anticoagulation but was never placed as the bleeding stopped shortly after.\n\n【16】A second neurology opinion, obtained per patient request, recommended to continue systemic anticoagulation for 3–6 months along with aspirin and atorvastatin. The patient was continued on IV heparin and titrated carefully for activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) goal of 50–55 seconds. She was given aspirin 325 mg daily initially and then decreased to aspirin 81 mg when aPTT became therapeutic. Atorvastatin 10 mg was continued throughout the hospital stay, without complication. The patient was eventually bridged to warfarin with an international normalized ratio (INR) goal of 2–3 with intention to continue for 3–6 months. At discharge, the patient continued with both low dose aspirin and warfarin without complications or neurological deficits. She follows up with neurology as outpatient. INR was monitored biweekly and remained within therapeutic range throughout the 3 months. MR angiography after three months showed complete resolution of the dissection . The patient did not report any bleeding complications from dual therapy.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 MR angiogram at 3-month follow-up showed complete resolution of bilateral dissection.</u>\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Literature Review\n\n【19】A systematic review through PubMed was conducted without any restrictions. We used the keywords: “bilateral,” “vertebral artery,” and “dissection.” The reference sections of the eligible results were screened for any potential missed cases of relevance to ensure the inclusion of all reported cases of bilateral vertebral artery dissection. Our search yielded one hundred and one manuscripts. Exclusion criteria included artery transections, unilateral dissections, dissection secondary to known aneurysms, congenital or acquired vasculopathies, dissection in arteries with anomalous origin, patients with connective tissue disorders, cases presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage, pediatric patients, patients with chromosopathies, articles other than case reports or case series, and articles not available in English. Thirty-two manuscripts describing cases of bilateral vertebral artery dissection in patients were included in our review and are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Reported cases of bilateral vertebral artery dissection.</u>\n\n【21】In our review, the age of presentation ranged between 23 and 52 years old. Of the thirty-two cases, eighteen (56.2%) were female patients. These baseline characteristics were consistent with previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 14\\]</u>. Among the identifiable risk factors for vertebral dissection, we found five patients presenting with associated comorbidities: one patient with chronic hypertension, three with a history of migraines, and one with acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 17\\]</u>. The remaining cases were otherwise healthy young adults. Thirteen cases of bilateral VA dissection (40.6%) presented spontaneously and without an identifiable trigger. Among those with a potential source of trauma, 6 patients were associated with chiropractic manipulation (Cases 1a, 4, 13, 17, 21, and 28), 6 to motor vehicle accident (Cases 3, 5, 6a, 11, and 12), 4 to sports with or without direct trauma (Cases 10, 14, 22, and 26), and one case followed 2 weeks postpartum (Case 25). Similar to our case, there were 2 cases associated with recent use of roller coasters (Cases 16 and 19).\n\n【22】The most common clinical presentations were occipital headache, unilateral or bilateral neck pain, and vertebrobasilar symptoms (dizziness, nausea, and vertigo). Two patients with multivessel compromise that included bilateral internal carotid artery dissection also presented with monocular vision loss or gaze deviation (Cases 19 and 25). The least common presentations were three cases of locked-in syndrome, one case of Horner syndrome, and one case of Brown-Sequard syndrome (Cases 3, 5, 6, and 9). In these cases, there was an extended compromise of the basilar artery, bilateral internal carotid arteries, or thoracic vertebral artery. Of all reported cases, one patient died 2 weeks after the development of symptoms (Case 1b).\n\n【23】Anticoagulation therapy with heparin was started in all nonsurgical patients once any contraindications were ruled out. One patient with extensive compromise of the posterior circulation required immediate thrombolytic therapy (Case 22). In this case, clinical deterioration followed, and the patient underwent suction thrombectomy 24 hours later. Follow-up 12 months after surgery showed clinical improvement with residual right incomplete hemianopsia. In another patient, stent placement was indicated given multiple vessel involvement, severe compromise of posterior circulation, and high risk of distal embolization (Case 25).\n\n【24】At discharge, most patients continued anticoagulation with warfarin for at least 3 months. The addition of other drugs and duration of treatment were variable. Chakrapi et al. reported use of prolonged anticoagulation with warfarin for six months, clopidogrel for eighteen months, and aspirin indefinitely. For most cases, follow-ups 3 to 6 months after the initial episode showed clinical improvement and partial to complete resolution of the arterial dissections.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【26】We report a case of bilateral VAD with embolic strokes in a young woman presenting with worsening posterior neck pain, headaches, and vertigo. We suspect that exposure to constant repetitive microtrauma during roller coaster rides may have caused the dissections, with subsequent deep tissue massage and block yoga mobilizing intramural thrombus causing the subclinical strokes.\n\n【27】Neck pain remains a very common complaint among patients. Approximately 10% of adults experience neck pain at any time, but only about 1% will develop further neurologic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Common causes of neck pain include cervical strain, internal disc disruption, cervical facet-mediated pain, “whiplash” syndrome, and myofascial pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Clinical symptoms that are persistent, worsening, or are associated with neurological deficits may suggest more serious causes.\n\n【28】An arterial dissection can occur at any age, and it is a recognized cause of stroke, especially in younger patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. The false lumen produced by the dissection can cause luminal stenosis or thrombosis, compromising the blood flow. A retrospective study of patients with cervical artery dissections found that, in patients with acute stroke, 85% was attributed to the thromboembolic mechanism, while only 12% was attributed to hypoperfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. In young adults, the cases of nontraumatic bilateral cervicocephalic artery dissections are less common but not rare. About 5–10% of carotid and 38% of VAD are bilateral. In a case series, bilateral spontaneous dissection was found in 8.1% of all patients with VAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.\n\n【29】In a review of 83 patients with unilateral vertebral artery dissection, without consciousness disturbance at admission, unilateral or bilateral headache was the most common complaint (60 cases), followed by neck pain (41 cases), and vertigo (20 cases). Statistically, unilateral headache and/or neck pain was more common in cases with definite vertebral artery dissection compared with other classifications per the Spontaneous Cervicocephalic Arterial Dissections Study  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. In the thirty-two cases of bilateral VAD we reviewed, 62.5% (20 patients) presented with either head or neck pain as the chief complaint. Ten cases reported involvement of other vessels: bilateral internal carotid in Cases 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 15; basilar artery in Cases 15 and 18; and multiple vessels in Cases 9 and 22. Therefore, medullary and pontine symptoms such as vertigo, dysphagia, and Horner syndrome predominated in these cases.\n\n【30】An analysis of a national trauma database showed that VADs only comprised 0.01% of all patients admitted with head and neck trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. Observational studies have produced a list of mild mechanical triggering events. Relevant to our case, amusement park rides have been implicated in VADs. Schneck et al. reported a case of a 34-year-old female who was misdiagnosed with labyrinthitis after presenting to her primary care physician complaining of vertigo. She had recently been to a national amusement park where she went on all but one ride. Similar to our case, the patient developed neck pain uncontrolled with analgesics and subsequently developed neurologic symptoms of blurry vision. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed bilateral VAD without infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Our patient’s dissection was complicated by multiple strokes, most notably in the left PICA territory but fortunately without any evidence of Wallenberg syndrome, Horner syndrome, or gait disturbances.\n\n【31】Multiple dissections are more frequently found in women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Arnold et al. used prospective hospital-based registries to identify risk factors and outcomes in patients with spontaneous cervical artery dissections. They found that 1.5% of patients had multiple dissections, and the majority was women. Additionally, these patients did not have any family history of such dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, or connective tissue disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. This is similar to our patient who had two dissections on imaging and no identifiable risk factors.\n\n【32】Traditionally, VADs are classified as extracranial and intracranial. Extracranial dissections in the hyperacute period can be treated with thrombolytic therapy. Outside said period, antithrombotic therapy with either single or dual antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents is the treatment of choice. VAD management remains challenging as there are no conclusive treatment guidelines. Anticoagulation therapy is controversial in intracranial dissections given the theoretical higher risk of bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Per the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, antithrombotic treatment with an anticoagulant or platelet inhibitor for at least 3–6 months is reasonable for patients with extracranial carotid or vertebral artery dissection associated with ischemic stroke or TIA (level of evidence: B) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>. However, there is no clear consensus regarding management for the use of anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy, or both, in patients without atherosclerotic disease in vertebral artery dissection.\n\n【33】Most recently, the CADISS trial compared antiplatelet treatment with anticoagulant treatment for extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection. It showed that recurrent stroke at 3 months is rare, with no significant difference between the two treatment groups. Although more strokes occurred in the antiplatelet group, this difference was counterbalanced by one major subarachnoid hemorrhage in the anticoagulant group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. Based on these results and several retrospective studies, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends either antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy for 3 to 6 months in patients with CAD-associated ischemic stroke (class of recommendation IIa, level of evidence B-NR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>. Some authors may favor antiplatelet treatment given its safer profile and the risk of warfarin inducing expansion of the intramural hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50\\]</u>. However, this and other complications such as hemorrhagic transformation are rare events. Our literature review indicates that most physicians gravitate towards early anticoagulation with heparin and then transitioning to oral warfarin. This action may be supported by the theoretical benefit of anticoagulation in the prevention of occlusion of a stenotic vessel and minimization of distal embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46, 51, 52\\]</u>.\n\n【34】The combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy is controversial, as it increases the hemorrhagic risk. However, even in the setting of hemorrhagic transformation, antithrombotic therapy could be continued based on the individual risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>. In this patient, we took into consideration her past medical history (dyslipidemia and recent OCP use), low risk of bleeding (Has-bled score of 2), the high grade, bilateral compromise of the vertebral arteries, presence of a subintimal clot in close proximity to the basilar artery, and acute embolic strokes. Our approach allowed for management of her risk factors, prevention of recurrent strokes, and potential lethal compromise of the basilar artery by distal embolization. In this particular case, the authors concluded that the benefits of such therapy outweighed the risks. To our knowledge, this is the first report of dual antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy in bilateral VAD. The patient was closely monitored in a neurologic progressive unit with serial neurovascular assessment without any eventualities. Upon discharge, she continued with the same regiment, and no adverse events were reported.\n\n【35】There are no concrete data on the ideal duration of antithrombotic therapy. Current recommendation is to continue antithrombotic therapy for 3 to 6 months, as the vessel heals. Further treatment should be tailored based on imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Chakrapi et al. reported one case of bilateral ICA and VA dissection that was managed with prolonged anticoagulation therapy plus dual antiplatelet therapy. At 6 months follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, and warfarin was discontinued. The 1-year CT scan results showed residual dissection of 30% in the right ICA and persistent 30 to 50% dissection in both VA. For these reasons, the patient continued clopidogrel for 12 months (18 months in total since the episode) and aspirin indefinitely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Some studies are proposing the use of new oral anticoagulant agents (NOAC) as an attractive therapeutic alternative. A recent retrospective observational study compared the use of NOAC to conventional anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in patients with CAD. The results show that NOAC have similar rate of recurrence of stroke, lower risk of major bleeding, but higher risk for radiologic worsening than conventional anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies. Additionally, two case reports showed complete resolution of the lesion at 3 and 6 months follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53, 54\\]</u>. In one of the reports, there were two cases of minor bleeding (hemorrhoidal and metrorrhagia), none of which required discontinuation of therapy.\n\n【37】NOAC have been found safer than warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[55\\]</u>. In addition to their safety profile, NOAC may be a more attractive choice for younger patients who are socially active, as there is no need for continuous monitoring of medication or interference with diet and lifestyle. On the contrary, titration is required in older patients with renal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. However, randomized clinical trials should be conducted to determine if NOAC are effective and safe in this population.\n\n【38】Endovascular management (EM) is considered in patients with progression of disease despite antithrombotic treatment, those presenting with pseudoaneurysm or in those not amenable for anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50\\]</u>. The safety and efficacy of EM have been explored in several retrospective studies, with overall good outcome profiles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57, 58\\]</u>. In a retrospective study, 140 patients with CAD were treated with stent placement. In the follow-up period, imaging showed improvement of the vascular stenosis. Additionally, only 1.4% of the patients presented with stroke events after the intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>. A meta-analysis of 39 retrospective studies involving different treatment modalities for VADs in adults was done to determine clinical outcomes of patients who were treated endovascularly. Overall, 75.11% had excellent outcomes, 10.10% had good outcomes, and 13.70% had poor outcomes. Of significance, postoperative complications occurred in 10.52%, with 2.73% exhibiting vasospasm, 3.03% experiencing postoperative rebleeding, and 6.31% developing ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. While most studies showed clinical and radiologic improvement of the vascular lesion and an acceptable rate of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>, conservative medical management remains the treatment of choice. Current indications for EM in CAD include recurrent ischemic events, high-grade arterial stenosis dissection with significantly limited flow, expanding pseudoaneurysm associated with dissection and occlusion, and failed medical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>. Surgical treatment may be indicated when the patient presents with recurrent strokes despite medical treatment and failed or not a candidate for endovascular therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.\n\n【39】In our review, two patients required surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31, 60\\]</u>. The first patient presented with worsening symptoms 24 hr after thrombolytic therapy, requiring suction thrombectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>. The second patient had dissection of multiple cervical vessels and severe compromise of the posterior circulation. For these reasons, three overlapping stents were placed in each vertebral artery. Both patients recovered successfully with minimal sequelae. When choosing a treatment modality, whether it is operative versus nonoperative, complications for each should be taken into careful consideration.\n\n【40】Per AHA guidelines, the management of additional risk factors should take place as soon as possible. Dyslipidemia is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor, and its management with statins has become a staple in ischemic strokes secondary to atherosclerotic disease. The role of dyslipidemia in the pathophysiology of artery dissection is less clear. Gupta et al. reported that traumatic dissections of the cervical arteries are more likely to occur in a vessel exposed to vascular risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>, and Yamada et al. reported correlation between dyslipidemia and vascular repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u>. However, most patients with VAD are young and present without classic cardiovascular risk factors. We considered statin therapy appropriate in this patient given her particular risk factors (history of dyslipidemia and traumatic VAD).\n\n【41】There are not any evidence-based recommendations on the restrictions or continuation of physical activity after an episode of CAD. Although participation in sports has been reported in many cases, causation has not been demonstrated. The recurrence of CAD is uncommon, with a reported incidence of 2% within the first month of the event and a year incidence of 1% after that 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63\\]</u>. This information is insufficient to draw any conclusions regarding the role of physical activity in the recurrence of CAD. Some experts recommend patients with dissection to avoid contact sports, chiropractic manipulation, and activities that involve abrupt mobilization of the neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Prospective studies to determine the effect of different levels of physical activity on the recurrence of CAD may be unfeasible, given the low rate of recurrence. In this case, the patient was advised to avoid any contact sports, manipulation of the neck, yoga, and roller coasters.\n\n【42】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【43】This case was written to raise awareness for health care providers, especially general practitioners and emergency department physicians, regarding injuries in the adult population after amusement park rides and/or other physical activities which involve excessive, forceful, or repetitive movements of the neck. We report a case of bilateral VAD complicated by embolic strokes in a young patient presenting with worsening posterior neck pain and headaches. These general complaints are unspecific and common in previously healthy patients. This diagnostic challenge requires an astute clinician to combine symptoms with key historical elements. Since patients can present immediately after the event or several days later when conservative management has been unsuccessful, it is imperative to keep a broad differential diagnosis in patients with neck pain that is nonresponsive to initial conservative management. We insist on the importance of high clinical suspicion to facilitate an early diagnosis.\n\n【44】Management-wise, most cases treated with anticoagulation therapy resolve in the following six to twelve months period without major neurologic deficits, especially in absence of intracranial vessel compromise. There is no consensus on whether antiplatelet therapy is superior to anticoagulation therapy, but current evidence favors the use of antiplatelets in the cases of intracranial dissection and extracranial dissection without ischemic symptoms. If there is evidence of thrombus or severe vessel occlusion, anticoagulation therapy may be preferred in order to prevent distal embolization. Our review showed that most physicians opt for anticoagulation with heparin during the intrahospital stay and bridge to warfarin at discharge. Antithrombotic therapy duration has not been defined yet, but it is usually carried for 3 to 6 months or until evidence of a well-established healing or resolution of the dissection. Reports on the use of NOAC show initial positive outcomes, but larger prospective studies are required before reaching definitive conclusions. The addition of other drugs such as atorvastatin, aspirin, or clopidogrel is left to the physician’s discretion and the patient's individual risk factors. Successful management with endovascular and surgical procedures has been reported in several cases, but their safety and efficacy are yet to be proven in randomized clinical trials. There are not any evidence-based recommendations on the restrictions or continuation of physical activity after an episode of CAD. Experts’ advice is to avoid contact sports, high-risk activities, and neck manipulation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:06:18", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:06:39", "cost": 21.26}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:06:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:06:18"}

Due to a rare combination of primary tumors occurring in the family presented herein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, we assumed a hereditary predisposition and thus, Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) was considered to be the most likely differential diagnosis. First reported by Li and Fraumeni in 1969 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, this syndrome is characterized by its onset at an early age and an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with germline mutations at the tumor suppressor gene p53 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】To confirm the hypothesized diagnosis of LFS, we set out to investigate this case by analyzing the tumor suppressor gene p53.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 76-year-old Caucasian female was referred to our department due to a 6-month history of constant aching pain over her left hip region. Imaging features were very typical of a primary bone tumor and thus, as tentative diagnosis chondrosarcoma was made by the reporting radiologist . Subsequently performed tumor staging revealed the tumor as being a primary with an otherwise clear bone scan, CT chest, and abdomen. There was no evidence of metastatic disease. However, imaging of the kidneys suggested possible renal cell carcinoma involving the right kidney.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Preoperative MRI showing the left femur of a 76-year-old Caucasian female with diagnosis dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (a) anterior-posterior axial view, (b) anterior-posterior front view. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】Biopsy specimen of the proximal left femur revealed a biphasic tumor composed of a cartilaginous component with abrupt transition into a noncartilaginous malignant mesenchymal component . The diagnosis of a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma was made.

Wide surgical margins were achieved. Although the patient was reasonably fit, adjuvant chemotherapy was not given due to the patient’s age.\n\n【11】During the further course of treatment, the suspicious condition in the right kidney, that had already been present during initial tumor staging prior to limb salvage surgery, was diagnosed as clear-cell renal cell carcinoma  and immediately subjected to nephrectomy. There was no evidence of metastatic disease. After more than 5 years of followup the patient is still free of disease.\n\n【12】Besides the current complaints described above, the patient underwent hysterectomy and cholecystectomy years ago. She could not remember the reason and there is no documentation discussing why those operations were performed. However, her medical family history  revealed that her youngest brother started suffering from invasive medium- to-low differentiated urothelial carcinoma  of the bladder when he was 67-year-old. He died at age 69 of a fibroblastic osteosarcoma  located in his left femur. Their mother presented with renal cell carcinoma as well when she was 65-year-old (specimen not available).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Pedigree of the family presented, RCC: renal cell carcinoma, CHS: chondrosarcoma, OS: osteosarcoma, BL: urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | (a) Biopsy specimen of the proximal left femur of a 69-year-old Caucasian male with diagnosis fibroblastic osteosarcoma (200x), H.E.

Moreover, the entire coding (exons 2–11) region and flanking intron regions of TP53 were sequenced. Since both MLPA and sequenciation did not reveal pathologic changes of the TP53 gene, the GAG-banding pattern derived from cell division was analyzed as well. However, chromosomal aberrations were not detected in the cytogenetic analysis neither for structural or numerical reasons. Taking into account all the results obtained, the diagnosis of LFS could not be confirmed, but there is still uncertainty regarding a definitive diagnosis in terms of a possible new genetic syndrome.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Due to a rare combination of urinary tract and bone tumors occurring in the family presented herein, we hypothesized a hereditary predisposition and thus, the tentative diagnosis Li-Fraumeni syndrome was made.\n\n【18】In fact, positive family anamnesis is an important risk factor for cancer. The genetic defect in LFS is a germline mutation at the tumor suppressor gene p53 with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Accordingly, children of affected parents are at 50% risk of being mutation carriers. As the family pedigree shown in Figure 3 points out that there are a lot of children, a diagnosed syndrome could be very helpful to reduce risk for unaffected offspring. However, none of the offspring has yet developed cancer .\n\n【19】Due to a variety of neoplasms and the family history reported herein, LFS was strongly considered nevertheless. In contrast to other syndromes, for instance neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, LFS is characterized by various but characteristic multiple primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Accordingly, significant differences in the distribution of bone tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, leukemia, melanoma, lung cancer, tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas should be expected compared with the general population. Although an early age at onset is frequent, patients are also at increased risk of developing multiple primary late-onset malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The overall lifetime risk of cancer is estimated close to 80% in patients with pathologic changes of the TP53 gene; approximately 40% develops cancer during the first two decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Further explanations like variable expressivity and germline mosaicism or de novo mutation in the patient brother’s TP53 gene were considered but finally denied due to low probability. Nonmedical explanations, including alternate paternity or maternity or undisclosed adoption, were explored and ruled out by means of family examination. Furthermore, a nonsyndromic cause of familial cancer is still being reasonable as pathologic changes of the TP53 gene have not been proven. Based on current data, some minor changes found in the DNA sequence can be classified as polymorphism without pathologic significance; however, current data may be subject to change. A genetic predisposition, perhaps due to other, currently unknown factors may still not be excluded. Besides, MLPA and sequenciation as methods for genetic testing may perhaps be too limited. However, these tools are standard procedures in our institutes.\n\n【21】As the case reported herein implies that families with highly suspicious medical family history should be closely monitored to minimize disease-related morbidity.

A rare case of spontaneous rupture of SPT is reported. A 13-year-old female felt acute abdominal pain without blunt abdominal trauma. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor in the pancreas tail with fluid collection around it. The tumor was diagnosed as SPT with hemoperitoneum associated with spontaneous rupture. The bleeding was stopped conservatively and she was referred for surgery at three months after the rupture. At that time, CT revealed a tumor 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreas tail without distant metastases. Since peritoneal dissemination was not seen on intraoperative exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT with rupture of the capsule of tumor, and complete resection was confirmed. The patient has been followed up for two years, and she is alive without recurrence.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas was first described by Frantz in 1959 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. SPT is regarded as an uncommon low grade malignant tumor accounting for 1-2% of exocrine pancreatic tumors, usually affecting young females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>. The clinical presentations of SPT have been various and not specific. SPT was discovered by rupture and hemoperitoneum which was considered to be rare. In the literature, most of the ruptures of SPT were associated with the blunt abdominal trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>, while the spontaneous rupture seemed to be quite uncommon. We report a rare case of a spontaneous ruptured SPT which was resected completely by elective laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain. She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it . The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor. Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously. The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender. Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor. At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable. The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared . From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed. Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears . Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss. Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4. Except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT of the pancreas. The negative surgical margin and the rupture of the capsule of tumor were verified by microscopic examination . She survived without recurrence of disease for two years after the operation.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Urgent CT of acute abdomen.

Discussion\n\n【11】It is well known that SPT usually shows no characteristic clinical presentation, and the main nonspecific symptoms are abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4, 9–12\\]</u>. In the present case, tumor was discovered by acute abdominal pain due to rupture of the tumor and hemoperitoneum. The incidence of the rupture of SPT was reported in 2.7% of 292 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Regarding rupture of SPT, blunt abdominal trauma was the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u> and according to a review article, 3% of 718 cases of SPT were discovered after the trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Other cases were considered to be spontaneous rupture and it was estimated to occur in approximately 1% of all SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Since the cystic part of SPT consisted of the degeneration after the intramural hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9, 13, 16\\]</u>, SPT had a natural tendency to hemorrhage inside the tumor. Therefore, the spontaneous rupture of SPT was considered to result from both abrupt massive hemorrhage and increase of the pressure in the tumor. Panieri and colleagues reported a case of the major bleed into the lesser sac causing the rupture of SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, and the enhanced CT also revealed a massive bleeding around the pancreatic tumor when our patient felt acute abdominal pain. Moreover, the tumor of the present case seemed to be slightly larger at the moment of rupture than three months later. When the abrupt hemorrhage occurred in the abdomen, emergency laparotomy was usually indicated. However, in the present case, the hemorrhage stopped with conservative therapy and allowed elective surgical treatment.\n\n【13】Surgical resection is the only treatment to cure SPT generally assuring a good prognosis, as reflected in the overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 95% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 12\\]</u>. Most cases of SPT have previously undergone the standard pancreatic resections such as pancreatoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy, because the tumors were relatively large and misdiagnosed as malignant disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11\\]</u>. However, the surgical procedure indicated for SPT still remains controversial. Namely, taking into account the character of SPT, if at all possible the surgical procedures preserving pancreatic parenchyma and function should be selected. Butte and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> described microscopic margins that were not considered a strong prognostic factor for the disease recurrence in SPT. Therefore, either partial resection or enucleation might be indicated for the small SPT, especially those localized in the periphery of the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 11, 17, 18\\]</u>. Actually, local resections and enucleations were performed in approximately 30% of SPT according to the recent literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 19, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【14】On the other hand, there was a report that enucleation for the pancreatic tumor had a high risk of pancreatic fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Although postoperative pancreatic fistula was reported in 38% of sixty-one enucleation cases of the pancreatic tumor, it was considered a safe and effective procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 21\\]</u>. Li and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> recommended a minimized resection such as enucleation and partial resection for SPT, because there were no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative complications and the prognosis between the minimized resection and the standard resection.\n\n【15】In pancreatic surgery, the laparoscopic technique has been increasingly applied in recent years, but it still remains uncommon. Both enucleation and distal pancreatectomy were procedures without reconstruction. Therefore, they were the first to be performed by the laparoscopic approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>. These laparoscopic procedures of enucleation and distal pancreatectomy have already been considered to be feasible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–22\\]</u> and have shown good indications for the low-grade malignant SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 21, 22\\]</u>. It was mentioned that there were no statistically significant differences in the postoperative complications and the prognosis between laparoscopic surgery and ordinary surgery for SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. With regard to SPT, parenchyma preserving surgical procedure with laparoscopy should be considered if the tumor is small in size and located away from the main pancreatic duct.\n\n【16】There might be another argument in the surgical approach for ruptured SPT. Namely, when the emergency operation was decided just after the rupture of SPT, open surgery might usually be selected. Since acute hemorrhage due to the rupture of SPT was stopped by conservative therapy in the present case, we considered elective laparoscopic surgery. But if the peritoneal dissemination was seen on intraoperative laparoscopic exploration, the conversion to open surgery was considered necessary for curable resection of a metastatic lesion with primary tumor.\n\n【17】Recurrence was reported to occur in 10% to 15% of SPT patients after surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 10, 12\\]</u>. Kim and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> asserted that the tumor rupture might be the risk factor for recurrence after surgery for SPT. The previous reports showed that peritoneal dissemination of SPT occurred in only few cases even after the rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 14, 23, 24\\]</u>, although rupture of SPT was expected to be the most predictable factor for the peritoneal dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 25\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Actually, some case reports indicated that disease free periods of the ruptured cases ranged from 12 to 66 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 15, 25, 26\\]</u>. On the other hand, Kyokane et al. reported that the dissemination associated with the rupture of SPT was seen in only one case among the six cases of SPT with peritoneal dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Since the rupture of SPT has been quite uncommon, the relationship between rupture of SPT and peritoneal dissemination remains to be resolved.\n\n【19】In conclusion, a quite uncommon case of spontaneous rupture of the solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas has been described. Although emergency laparotomy is usually performed in the case with hemoperitoneum associated with rupture of the pancreatic tumor, we were able to resect SPT completely by elective laparoscopic surgery. SPT is considered to be a low-grade malignancy and a good prognosis is expected after the surgery. However, our patient who is alive without recurrence after surgery for two years should continue to be followed up carefully.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:03:54", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:04:47", "cost": 53.352}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:04:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:03:53"}

Contrast-enhanced CT showed that the mass extended to and obstructed the right main pulmonary artery. A skip lesion was also suspected in the periphery of pulmonary artery trunk. The tumor was removed by right pneumonectomy accompanied by resection of the main and left pulmonary arteries under cardiopulmonary bypass.

Introduction\n\n【3】Sarcoma of the pulmonary artery (PAS) is a rare disease with about 200 cases reported so far in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. The prognosis is generally poor with a reported mean survival of about 20 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In most cases, the lesion is confined to the vicinity of the main pulmonary artery.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A female patient in her 30s was referred to our institution with a complaint of persistent cough. Chest radiography revealed a mass in the right middle lung field . Noncontrast CT showed a mass approximately 8 centimeters in diameter with relatively smooth margins in the right lung segment 6 . A malignant lung tumor was suspected and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was done. FDG accumulation was seen in the lung mass (standardized uptake value max. 3.6) as well as in the mediastinum suggesting a malignant lung tumor with mediastinal lymph node metastasis . Bronchoscopy revealed a tumorous lesion obstructing right B6 . Biopsy of this lesion showed proliferation of spindle cells raising suspicion of sarcoma or spindle cell carcinoma.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Chest radiography showing a mass in the right middle lung field.

(d) On bronchoscopy, a whitish tumorous lesion was seen obstructing right B6 (arrow).</u>\n\n【7】Next, contrast-enhanced CT was done, and it showed that the mediastinal lesion pointed out on FDG-PET/CT was actually a continuous extension of the lung mass into the right main pulmonary artery. A skip lesion was also suspected in the periphery of the pulmonary artery trunk .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Contrast-enhanced CT showing obstruction of the right pulmonary artery (arrow). A skip lesion was also suspected in the periphery of the pulmonary artery trunk (arrowhead).</u>\n\n【9】Lung ventilation-perfusion scan showed that the right lung was not perfused although sufficiently ventilated. On echocardiography, heart wall motion was intact and no signs of right heart failure were seen.\n\n【10】Collectively, a sarcomatous lung tumor with extension into the right pulmonary artery trunk or PAS with extension into the right lung was suspected. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor under cardiopulmonary bypass through a median sternotomy. The existence and localization of the skip lesion was first confirmed by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Venous cannulas were placed in the right atrium and the femoral vein, and an arterial cannula was placed onto the femoral artery, and surgery was carried out with the heart beating. The left pulmonary artery was carefully dissected so as not to perturb the skip lesion and was clamped just proximal to the origin of left A3. Although the tumor filled the inside of the right pulmonary artery, its wall appeared to be intact from outside. Then the main pulmonary artery was incised just above the pulmonary valve and opened distally to expose the tumor. To remove all lesions, proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery together with the pulmonary artery trunk was resected. The left pulmonary artery was reconstructed with a 20 mm Gore-Tex vascular graft and the patient was separated from cardiopulmonary bypass. Following that, right pneumonectomy and total resection of the tumor were completed. Time on bypass was 2 hours and 11 minutes. Duration of operation was 9 hours and 9 minutes.\n\n【11】Grossly, the tumor seemed to arise in the large vessel of the pulmonary circulation and invade into the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma, especially in the S6 region . The tumor was diagnosed as intimal sarcoma and its histological findings, proliferation of atypical spindle or polygonal cells with high mitotic activity, were also compatible with the diagnosis . The lesions were completely removed macroscopically. Further resection, particularly the distal portion of the left main pulmonary artery, was not considered to be feasible. However, the surgical margin of the left pulmonary artery was microscopically positive for tumor cells . The patient was followed up without further treatment.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 (a) Gross finding showed the obstruction of the right main pulmonary artery by tumor tissue.

Irradiation and proton therapy were done. The recurrence is without progression 2 months after detection.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Clinical diagnosis of PAS is considered to be difficult. Symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, chest or back pain, fever, or weight loss have been reported, but they are usually nonspecific. Previous reports have shown that the lesions are mostly confined to the vicinity of pulmonary artery trunk and are often initially diagnosed as pulmonary thromboembolisms. FDG-PET may be useful in differentiating pulmonary thromboembolism and PAS, but some reports indicate that PASs may not always show high FDG uptake 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Case reports of EBUS-TBNA exist showing its effectiveness in the differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In the present case, a malignant lung tumor with mediastinal lymph node metastasis was initially suspected from noncontrast CT and FDG-PET/CT. To our knowledge, significant extension of PAS into the lung, as was observed in the present case, has not been previously reported. This is also the first report of PAS in which the primary lesion could be biopsied under bronchoscopy. The reason for this tumor extension is not clear. It is possible that in this particular case the primary lesion originated from the right main pulmonary artery rather than the pulmonary artery trunk. Since PASs are generally known to extend in the direction of blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, the lesion in the present case extended predominantly towards the periphery of the right pulmonary artery rather than towards the pulmonary artery trunk, and, because of this unilateral extension, the patient remained symptomless until a large tumor was formed in the right lung.\n\n【17】PAS may show a variety of histological differentiations such as leiomyosarcomas, angiosarcomas, malignant fibrous histiocytomas, and others but are mostly without differentiation. These are collectively termed intimal sarcomas, as is this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. Early diagnosis and surgical resection currently offer the best chance of prolonged survival for PAS. The efficacy of chemotherapy or radiotherapy for PAS still remains controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Therefore, adjuvant therapy was not done in this case although the surgical margin was positive. After the detection of recurrence, proton therapy was selected because the recurrence was localized, and we considered that the general condition of the patient would be best sustained by this treatment in comparison with systemic chemotherapy or reresection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:09:44", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:09:53", "cost": 8.402}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:09:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:09:44"}

Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is the congenital presence of pancreatic tissue outside its normal location in the absence of vascular and anatomical connection with the main pancreas. HP can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, and it is mostly encountered in the stomach. The gallbladder is a rare site of HP, and our literature review revealed that only 38 cases were reported. We present a case of HP in the gallbladder that was presented with a picture of acute cholecystitis. After the case presentation, we will discuss HP in the gallbladder by reviewing the literature. Case Presentation. A 49-year-old male presented to the emergency department complaining of progressively worsening right upper abdominal pain for the last 24 hours. After thorough history and physical examination, a provisional diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a rim of edema surrounding the gallbladder wall with two stones impacted at the gallbladder neck. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed with an uneventful postoperative course, and the patient was discharged the next day. Microscopic examination of the gallbladder showed that a heterotopic pancreatic tissue, composed of a large number of pancreatic acini and few ducts with the absence of islets of Langerhans, was found around the cystic duct. The patient was asymptomatic at the regular follow-up six months postoperatively. Conclusion. HP in the gallbladder is an extremely rare finding. Its clinical presentation is not different from other cholecystopathic diseases. Most cases were accompanied by cholelithiasis. Preoperative laboratory and imaging modalities are usually not helpful in the diagnosis of HP in the gallbladder. The definitive diagnosis is made by histological examination of the gallbladder specimen. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is sufficing treatment.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is the congenital presence of pancreatic tissue outside its normal location in the absence of vascular and anatomical connection with the main pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There is no consensus about the exact origin of HP until the present. Three theories have been proposed to explain it. One adopted that HP is formed as a result of pancreatic tissue separation during the embryonic rotation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Another theory suggests that the longitudinal growth of the intestines is responsible for the migration of some cells from pancreatic buds which causes HP in different regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Irregularity in the notch signaling system is a recent accepted theory, which believes that irregularity in the signaling system that decides the destiny of pancreatic cells, specifically abnormalities in Hes-1 (Hairy/enhancer of split), might be a contributor in the formation of HP in the gallbladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. HP can be seen anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract, and it is mostly encountered in the stomach, duodenum, and colon with percentages of 27.5%, 25.5%, and 15.9%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Also, it can be seen in the esophagus, Meckel\\`s diverticulum, gallbladder, biliary tract, spleen, liver, omentum, and lung. Usually, heterotopic pancreatic tissue is asymptomatic, but it can present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. In autopsy studies, HP was found in about 0.5%–13.7% patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The estimated incidence of HP in abdominal surgeries is 0.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. HP in the gallbladder is an extremely rare finding. To the best of our knowledge, there are only 38 cases in the literature. In this case report, we present a case of HP in the gallbladder and the current literature reviewed.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Methodology and Data Collection\n\n【5】A thorough search among the published literature using the PubMed search engine was done. Specific search terms (keywords) were heterotopic pancreas or ectopic pancreas and gallbladder. The following filters were used: English language and human and case reports. A bibliography of relevant articles was reviewed in an attempt to find other relevant articles. The following data were collected: demographic information including age and gender, clinical presentation, sonographic findings including presence of gallstones, surgical intervention, site and size of the heterotopic pancreas (HP), and histological type of HP.\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case Report\n\n【7】A 49-year-old male presented to the emergency department complaining of progressively worsening right upper abdominal pain, which was continuous, dull aching in nature, and associated with vomiting for the last 24 hours. The patient had a previous history of mild abdominal pain, especially with fatty meals, for the past six months. On examination, he had a heart rate of 85 beats/minute, a blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg, a temperature of 37.4°C, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/minute. The abdominal examination revealed localized right upper quadrant tenderness with a positive Murphy’s sign. Laboratory investigations showed an elevated WBC count of 16.7 ∗ 103/μL (reference range: 4.5–10 ∗ 10<sup>3</sup>/μL) with 77% neutrophils, hemoglobin was 14.6 g/dL (reference range: 14–18 g/dL), and platelet count was 193 ∗ 10<sup>3</sup>/μL (reference range: 150–450 ∗ 10<sup>3</sup>/μL). Other laboratory results include aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 35 U/L (reference range: up to 37 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 33 U/L (reference range: up to 42 U/L), alkaline phosphatase was 103 U/L (reference range: 98–279 U/L), total bilirubin was 0.82 mg/dL (reference range: up to 1 mg/dL), direct bilirubin was 0.29 mg/dL (reference range: up to 0.20 mg/dL), and serum amylase was 97 U/L (reference range: 40–140 U/L). Urea, creatinine, and serum electrolytes (sodium and potassium) were within normal limits. Sonographic examination showed a thin gallbladder wall with two stones (12 and 4 mm) impacted in the neck, a rim of edema surrounding the gallbladder wall, and a normal common bile duct.\n\n【8】Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The operative findings were an edematous gallbladder wall with an adherent omentum to it, difficult dissection around the cystic duct, and only one single (15 mm) stone identified in the gallbladder specimen. The postoperative course went uneventfully, and the patient was discharged home the next day.\n\n【9】Microscopic examination of the gallbladder demonstrated an acute on the top of chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis. Moreover, a heterotopic pancreatic tissue, composed of a large number of pancreatic acini and few ducts with the absence of islets of Langerhans, was found around the cystic duct . Follow-up investigations after two weeks, including complete blood count, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, serum amylase, and lipase, were all normal. The patient was asymptomatic at regular follow-up six months postoperatively.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 H & E stain 40x: presence of pancreatic tissue (few ducts and large number of acini with absence of islets), i.e. type II, around the cystic duct.</u>\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Literature Review\n\n【12】A thorough search in the literature shows only 38 cases that have been reported with HP in the gallbladder. We made a summary table of reported cases found in the literature . Female predominance was noted, with an M : F ratio of about 1 : 2. However, our patient was male. The ages of reported cases ranged from eight to eighty with a mean of 43.6 and a median of 46, and most cases were above the age of 40. In most cases, biliary cholecystopathic symptoms were the primary indication for surgical interventions. Cholelithiasis was present in about 50% of cases. Moreover, HP in the gallbladder may resemble gallbladder polyps or malignancy by imaging studies, and this was the indication for surgery in about 10% of reported cases.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Demographic data, clinical presentation, and histopathology of 38 cases of heterotopic pancreas in the gallbladder.</u>\n\n【14】Out of the 38 cases, 29 were classified using Heinrich’s classification, which revealed that the most common type is type I. The cases were distributed as follows: 69% were type I, 24% were type II, while type III was present in 7% of cases. Our case was type II.

HP in the gallbladder is extremely uncommon. A case series of 212 cases of HP performed by Mayo Clinic revealed only one case of HP in the gallbladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. While the male to female ratio in HP in the gastrointestinal system is 3 : 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>, our literature review showed that HP in the gallbladder has a female predominance properly due to the higher number of cholecystectomies among female patients.\n\n【19】Although HP in the gallbladder is mostly asymptomatic and found incidentally postoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, the literature review showed that HP is associated with cholecystopathetic symptoms in most of the reported cases. The presentations range from biliary colic to hydrops gallbladder and even perforation of the gallbladder with peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The ectopic tissue is prone to the same pathological conditions as the normal pancreatic tissue such as abscess, pseudocyst formation, or chronic pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Despite that it was not reported in the literature about HP in the gallbladder, the malignant changes of the gastric heterotopic pancreas have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.

Conclusion\n\n【23】HP in the gallbladder is an extremely rare finding. Its clinical presentation is not different from other cholecystopathic diseases. Most cases are accompanied by cholelithiasis. Preoperative laboratory and imaging modalities are usually not helpful in the diagnosis of HP in the gallbladder.

We report a 48-year-old Japanese man who presented with initial manifestations of abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and bloody feces.

Introduction\n\n【3】Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic chronic inflammatory disease. While fever, joint pain, and rash are the most common symptoms, some patients predominately show manifestations in the hematologic, renal, or central nervous system. This lack of typical presentation often causes delay in diagnosis of SLE. Although lupus enteritis is relatively uncommon, it may lead to life-threatening complications such as bowel perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Early diagnosis is of great importance in management of lupus enteritis. Here, we describe a patient who presented with lupus enteritis and lupus cystitis as initial manifestations of SLE, for whom the diagnosis was delayed due to the atypical presentation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】On July 14, 2015, a 48-year-old Japanese man was admitted to an outside hospital with fever, vomiting, intermittent abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and bloody feces. Laboratory test results were as follows: white blood cell count, 2200/μL; hemoglobin, 14.9 g/dL; platelets, 14.9 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; C-reactive protein (CRP), 21.2 mg/dL; amylase, 529 U/L (normal < 120 U/L); albumin, 3.1 g/dL (normal > 3.8 g/dL); urea nitrogen, 48 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.33 mg/dL; and urine protein, 1+. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed bowel wall thickening and enhancement. A colonoscopy identified edematous changes from the ileum to the rectum. Colon biopsy showed lymphocyte infiltrations in the mucous membrane covering the epithelial cells. These findings led to a diagnosis of severe infectious enteritis. With antibiotics and bowel rest, diarrhea and abdominal pain partially improved. On August 5, oral intake was resumed. However, the gastrointestinal symptoms recurred, and abdominal CT still showed edematous bowel wall. It was thought unlikely that the symptoms were caused by infectious enteritis alone. On August 20, he was referred to us in the Department of Clinical Immunology at Kitano Hospital, and his symptoms were reevaluated. On admission, no alopecia, rash, oral ulcers, arthritis, neurological disorder, or bladder irritation was noted. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the epigastrium and diminished bowel sounds. Laboratory test results were as follows: anti-nuclear antibody (indirect immunofluorescence test) 1 : 160 (normal < 1 : 40); anti-dsDNA antibody 55.8 IU/mL (normal < 12 IU/mL); CH50 24.2 U/mL (normal: 30–50 U/mL); C3 88 mg/dL (normal: 65–135 mg/dL); C4 32 mg/dL (normal: 13–35 mg/dL); and urine protein 0.39 g/gCr. Chest CT showed bilateral pleural effusions. The patient fulfilled both the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification criteria and the American College of Rheumatology revised criteria (serositis, lymphopenia, positive anti-ANA antibody, and positive anti-dsDNA antibody) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with SLE developed with lupus enteritis. Intravenous administration of methylprednisolone (100 mg/day) was started immediately. However, 2 weeks later abdominal CT still showed bowel wall thickening and enhancement , engorgement of mesenteric vessels , bladder wall thickening , ascites, and bilateral pleural effusions. He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg) for 3 days, followed by intravenous methylprednisolone (100 mg/day). Bowel wall thickening rapidly improved, and the ascites and bilateral pleural effusions disappeared. The steroid was gradually tapered and changed to oral administration. However, his gastrointestinal symptoms recurred when the oral prednisolone dose was 40 mg/day (0.8 mg/kg/day). Intravenous cyclophosphamide at 1100 mg (750 mg/mm<sup>2</sup> BSA) was administered. He was discharged on oral prednisolone (35 mg/day) followed by monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide without recurrence.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT scan reveals bowel wall thickening and enhancement and engorgement of mesenteric vessels.

Discussion\n\n【9】Lupus enteritis is typically steroid-responsive with prompt treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. However, some patients develop severe complications such as bowel perforation, infarction, or obstruction. Early diagnosis is critical for management of lupus enteritis. However, clinical symptoms of lupus enteritis are often nonspecific with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody feces. Unless a patient presents with typical symptoms of SLE, such as fever, rash, joint pain, and/or hematologic, renal, or central nervous system manifestations, diagnosis can often be delayed. The most useful tool for the diagnosis of lupus enteritis is abdominal CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Typical CT findings of lupus enteritis include bowel wall thickening with enhancement (target sign), engorgement of mesenteric vessels (nodular sign and comb sign), and increased attenuation of mesenteric fat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6, 7\\]</u>. Also, lupus enteritis and lupus cystitis often occur concurrently; the common mechanism is thought to be smooth muscle dyskinesia due to immune complex-mediated damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate involvement of the urinary tract if lupus enteritis is suspected. In our patient, bowel wall thickening with enhancement (target sign), engorgement of mesenteric vessels (nodular sign and comb sign), and bladder wall thickening were also identified by retrospective analysis of the first abdominal CT. Physicians should be aware of the typical CT findings of lupus enteritis (target sign, nodular sign, and comb sign) and lupus cystitis (bladder wall thickening), although these findings are not specific to lupus enteritis as the above described abnormalities can also be seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Several studies evaluated predictive factors for the recurrence of lupus enteritis. Koo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> have suggested that involvement of the colon and urinary tract may be associated with the recurrence of lupus enteritis. Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and Yuan et al. demonstrated that bowel wall thickening (>8 or 9 mm) was a risk factor for recurrence. In addition, Yuan et al. showed that lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated serum amylase were associated with severe adverse events. Consistent with these findings, our case had involvement of the colon and urinary tract, bowel wall thickening (10 mm), lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated serum amylase, suggesting the patient was at high risk for recurrence and severe adverse events. As intravenous cyclophosphamide is recommended for patients with severe or steroid-resistant lupus enteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5, 8, 9\\]</u>, our case was successfully treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide. However, corticosteroids might have been adequate for the management of lupus enteritis if the case had been promptly diagnosed.

One of these adverse events is agranulocytosis, which, although rare, can be life-threatening if left untreated. The majority of agranulocytosis cases are caused by drugs, including antibiotics. Here, we report a case of severe agranulocytosis in a 96-year-old woman following antibiotic therapy which was successfully managed using recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and the appropriate choice of antibiotics to treat her concomitant infection.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Agranulocytosis is a rare and life-threatening condition, with an annual incidence of 1.1 to 4.9 cases per million population per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Up to 50% of agranulocytosis may be induced by nonchemotherapy drugs, such as antithyroid agents and antimicrobial medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The risk for developing this adverse event may be higher among elderly patients in Japan, who are often prescribed many types of medication, a phenomenon called polypharmacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The problem of polypharmacy is of particular concern in an aging society like Japan because elderly patients tend to have many underlying diseases as well as conditions that require various medications. We herein present a case of severe agranulocytosis following antibiotic treatment with garenoxacin and ceftriaxone. The patient was also prescribed 10 different kinds of medication regularly, making this a case that emphasizes the importance of recognizing severe drug-related adverse events and the potential danger of polypharmacy or unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 96-year-old woman was prescribed garenoxacin for 8 days after complaining of a bad cough, dyspnea, and anorexia at a nearby clinic. This was despite a simple laboratory blood test revealing a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7920/μL (55% neutrophils) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 0.33 mg/dL, findings that were unremarkable. However, she developed high-grade fever on the following day, and intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g daily for 6 days) was added to her treatment regime two days after prescribing garenoxacin. After 5 days of therapy with ceftriaxone, a follow-up laboratory blood test performed showed a WBC count of 1050/μL (0% neutrophils) and a CRP level of 6.67 mg/dL. Severe leucopenia was suspected, and she was referred to our hospital for evaluation.\n\n【7】During presentation, her blood pressure was 136/99 mmHg, her pulse rate was 87 beats per minute, and her body temperature was 37.4°C. Her respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute and peripheral oxygen saturation 97%. Chest sounds were normal, and other findings of physical examination were unremarkable. She was 150 cm in height with mild kyphosis and weighed 40 kg. She had a medical history of atrial fibrillation, stroke, hypertension, hypotonic urinary bladder, lower back pain, and gastritis. Her daily medications included candesartan, lansoprazole, amlodipine, carbocysteine, zaltoprofen, tranexamic acid, rivaroxaban, bisoprolol, brotizolam, and celecoxib.\n\n【8】Full blood count performed at our hospital revealed severe leucopenia with a WBC count of 830/µL (neutrophils 7/µL, eosinophils 8/μL, basophils 18/μL, monocytes 378/μL, and lymphocytes 415/μL). Other laboratory data are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph and computed tomography showed mild infiltrative shadow on her left lung. However, both blood and sputum culture results were negative.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory data on admission.</u>\n\n【10】She was diagnosed with drug-induced agranulocytosis (presumably from antibiotics used) with mild pneumonia and admitted to an isolated room. Candesartan, lansoprazole, amlodipine, and celecoxib were discontinued because they are also known to cause agranulocytosis. She was given meropenem hydrate intravenously (2 g/day) and levofloxacin hydrate orally (500 mg/day) for 10 days, after which a short course of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (4 g/day) was administered. Subcutaneous injection of filgrastim (recombinant human G-CSF, 75 µg/day) was also given to treat her neutropenia.\n\n【11】Filgrastim was administered for 6 days before the neutrophil count normalized to 2539/µL on day 6. Although her neutrophil count increased to 12,940/µL on day 9, it eventually stabilized around 3000 to 4000/µL after day 13. Table 2 summarizes the changes in WBC count, neutrophil count, and CRP levels during her hospitalization. Her fever receded after day 10, and she was discharged on day 18 without further complications.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Change in laboratory data after admission.</u>\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Although there is no clear consensus, polypharmacy may be defined as the concomitant use of five or more medications per day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Polypharmacy is a major concern in Japan as older patients such as ours are often given many different medications (10 in our patient) on a regular basis. The fact that patients have easy access to different specialists in Japan also increases the probability of polypharmacy as they often see many physicians without a primary care doctor carefully monitoring their medications. Furthermore, our patient was prescribed antibiotics, which may be due to her old age and the risk of developing pneumonia, after presenting with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The questionable practice of treating acute respiratory infections with antibiotics is still common in Japan. Lack of proper patient education has resulted in increased patient satisfaction when they are prescribed antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Studies have also demonstrated that the use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections does not result in increased adverse events and may even be slightly beneficial in preventing pneumonia hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Nevertheless, a recent study showed that older female patients as well as those with multiple comorbidities and medications (which fit our patient’s profile) have the highest risk of adverse drug reactions in the acute care setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This includes life-threatening conditions such as agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis, although rare, can be caused by many different drugs, including antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>. Without early detection, this condition may result in serious infections and subsequently sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our patient’s case, due to the timing and development of her agranulocytosis, we believe that it was most probably caused by garenoxacin or ceftriaxone, either directly or through interactions with her other drugs.\n\n【16】Currently, the standard treatment for drug-induced agranulocytosis is discontinuation of the responsible agent(s), antibiotic treatment if the presence of infection is suspected, and proper use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Although their efficacy is not conclusively proven, G-CSF has minimal toxicity and may be beneficial in the management of drug-induced agranulocytosis in elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Minor complications include bone pain and leukocytosis, which occurred in our patient but normalized after discontinuing therapy. As for antibiotic treatment, cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) is often employed as a first-line therapy for agranulocytosis with infection. Meropenem can be used as an alternative when cefepime is not tolerated well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. A recent study also demonstrated that, for severe cases (neutrophil count < 100/µL), meropenem may be the superior choice for monotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Meropenem was used due to the severely low neutrophil count and also because our patient’s agranulocytosis may have been caused by ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin).\n\n【17】In conclusion, we reported a case of severe agranulocytosis in an elderly patient which was managed successfully using rhG-CSF and proper choice of antibiotics. Elderly patients who are being prescribed many different medications need to be carefully managed and monitored for various adverse drug events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:59:47", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:00:15", "cost": 27.525}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:00:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:59:39"}

Although it is generally considered safe, common adverse drug reactions of ibuprofen include stomach pain, nausea, and heartburn. It can also cause gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially in individuals with a history of GI ulcers or bleeding disorders. Ibuprofen is predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C8. Individuals carrying the CYP2C9∗3 or CYP2C8∗3 non-functional alleles have reduced enzyme activities resulting in elevated ibuprofen plasma concentrations and half-life. We presented a case of a 31-year-old Saudi female patient with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had taken ibuprofen at 600 mg twice daily for eight weeks. The patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and black tarry stools. An emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on the patient, which revealed a deep bleeding ulcer measuring 1 × 1 cm in the antrum of the stomach. Laboratory investigations indicated anemia (hemoglobin: 7.21 g/dL and hematocrit: 22.40 g/dl). The patient received intravenous proton pump inhibitors and a packed red blood cell transfusion. Genetic analysis revealed that the patient was a carrier of CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles, indicating that the patient is a poor metabolizer for both enzymes. The patient’s symptoms improved over the subsequent days, and she was discharged with instructions to avoid NSAIDs. This is the first reported Saudi patient homozygous for CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles, which led to ibuprofen-induced upper GI toxicity. This case demonstrates the importance of contemplating CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 genetic variations when administrating NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Careful assessment of the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy in each patient and consideration of alternative pain management strategies must be conducted when appropriate.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) commonly used to alleviate moderate pain and fever and to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Ibuprofen is a cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 inhibitor, catalyzing prostaglandin synthesis. The inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 may account for ibuprofen’s antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Ibuprofen is available over the counter in most countries and is generally considered safe. However, like other NSAIDs, ibuprofen can cause potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which include nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, diarrhea, and headache 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>. Ibuprofen can also cause serious complications, including GI bleeding and ulcers (1-2%), hypertension (up to 5%), myocardial infarction (up to 1% per year), and heart failure (up to 1%), and renal damage and sudden cardiac death have also been observed in rare cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Ibuprofen is predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 to form the inactive metabolites hydroxyibuprofen and carboxyibuprofen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. These metabolites are then eliminated from the body through the urine. The rate of metabolism and elimination of ibuprofen can vary depending on factors such as age, liver function, genetic variations in CYP enzymes, and concurrent use of other medications that affect CYP activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 genes can alter these enzymes’ activity and the ibuprofen’s metabolism, leading to variations in drug efficacy and ADRs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. The most studied CYP2C9 polymorphisms are CYP2C9∗2 (rs1799853) and CYP2C9∗3 (rs1057910). Individuals carrying the CYP2C9∗2 and CYP2C9∗3 variant alleles have decreased enzymatic activities, approximately 5% and 12%, respectively, compared to individuals with the CYP2C9∗1 wild-type allele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. As a result, individuals carrying these variant alleles may have slower metabolism of ibuprofen, leading to higher drug concentrations and a longer duration of action 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. Studies have shown that individuals carrying the CYP2C9∗2 and CYP2C9∗3 variant alleles are at higher risk of developing ADRs and toxicities to ibuprofen, such as GI bleeding or kidney damage, compared to individuals carrying the wild-type CYP2C9∗1 allele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. Furthermore, individuals who carry the CYP2C8∗3 (rs10509681) allele have reduced enzymatic activity relative to the wild-type CYP2C8∗1 allele. The CYP2C8∗3 allele has been linked to diminished ibuprofen metabolism and clearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【6】This paper presents a unique case involving a Saudi patient homozygous for both CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles, which led to ibuprofen-induced upper GI toxicity. This is the first documented case reporting a combination of genetic variants and their association with ADRs following ibuprofen administration.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】We report a case of a 31-year-old Saudi female patient diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for one year. As part of her RA management, the patient has been prescribed a weekly oral dose of methotrexate at 7.5 mg and a daily folic acid supplementation of 1 mg/day for 12 months. Additionally, for the past eight weeks, the patient has been self-medicating with ibuprofen at 600 mg twice daily to alleviate acute pain associated with RA. The patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and black tarry stools. Notably, the patient reported that these symptoms started on the day she sought emergency services. The patient did not report any preexisting medical conditions, including GI disorders or ulcers. Furthermore, the patient had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption and exhibited a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n【9】On physical examination, the patient exhibited signs of hemodynamic instability. In the supine position, the patient’s blood pressure was measured at 90/30 mmHg, indicating hypotension. Additionally, the patient displayed tachycardia, with a heart rate of 130 beats per minute. The abdominal examination demonstrated epigastric tenderness along with abdominal guarding and rigidity. Laboratory investigations showed anemia (hemoglobin: 7.21 g/dL (normal: 14–18 g/dl) and hematocrit: 22.40 g/dl (normal: 14–18 g/dl)) and mild leukocytosis (white blood cells (WBC): 13700/mm<sup>3</sup> (normal: 4–11 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>)). Liver functions, blood sugar, urea, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters were all within normal ranges.\n\n【10】An emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed on the patient, which revealed a deep ulcer measuring 1 × 1 cm in the antrum of the stomach. The ulcer was characterized by the presence of a visible vessel, consistent with a Forrest Ib classification, indicating active bleeding. Additionally, according to the Sakita classification, the ulcer was classified as Sakita Type II, representing a deep ulcer with a visible vessel or clot. Notably, the EGD examination did not reveal any additional abnormal endoscopic findings throughout the esophagus, duodenum, or other regions of the upper GI tract. Importantly, gastric biopsies obtained from both the antrum and body regions yielded negative results for Helicobacter pylori infection. The patient was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer and was promptly administered an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) alongside a transfusion of packed red blood cells to correct the accompanying anemia. The patient was hospitalized to closely monitor for any indications of recurrent bleeding.\n\n【11】Analysis of genetic variations in CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3, which play a significant role in the metabolism of ibuprofen, was performed. The patient’s DNA was collected from saliva samples using an Oragene DNA saliva collection kit (OG-500, Genotek, Canada), and genotyping of CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 alleles was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) following previously described protocols 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. In brief, CYP2C9∗3 was detected using the forward and reverse PCR primers 5′-TGC​ACG​AGG​TCC​AGA​GAT​GC-3′ and 5′-GAT​ACT​ATG​AAT​TTG​GGG​ACT​TC-3′ (Macrogen, Korea), respectively. The amplified PCR products were digested with 5 U restriction enzymes Mph1103I (NsiI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) overnight at 37°C. The detection for CYP2C9∗3 was performed using the forward and reverse primers 5′-CTT​CCG​TGC​TAC​ATG​ATG​ACG-3′ and 5′-CTG​CTG​AGA​AAG​GCA​TGA​AG-3′ (Macrogen, Korea), respectively. The amplified PCR products were digested with 5 U restriction enzymes PdmI (XmnI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) by overnight incubation at 55°C. The digested PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under ultraviolet light. The representative agarose gel images of CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗2 PCR-RFLP assays were used to interpret the patient’s genotypes . The CYP2C9∗3 allele produced 50 bp and 118 bp after digestion with Mph1103I (NsiI) , while the CYP2C8∗3 allele produced as a single band at 117 bp that is not cut following the digestion with PdmI (XmnI) . The genotyping results revealed that the patient was homozygous for the CYP2C9∗3 non-functional allele (CYP2C9∗3/∗3) and CYP2C8∗3 non-functional allele (CYP2C8∗3/∗3). According to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), the patient is a CYP2C9 poor metabolizer (homozygous CYP2C9∗3) and CYP2C8 poor metabolizer (homozygous CYP2C8∗3). Poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 enzymes exhibit reduced metabolic activity, resulting in a diminished ability to metabolize ibuprofen. Consequently, these individuals experience slower clearance of the drug from their bodies. These genetic variations may have contributed to the patient’s increased risk of GI ulcers while taking ibuprofen.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) results of CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 polymorphisms.

A repeat EGD was performed, revealing promising signs of ulcer healing. Consequently, the revised Forrest classification for the ulcer was determined to be III, indicating a healing ulcer. Correspondingly, the Sakita classification for the patient was categorized as Sakita Type III, providing further affirmation of the ongoing healing process of the ulcer. During the patient’s hospitalization, a transition was made from intravenous to oral PPI therapy. After two days without any signs of rebleeding and with the patient’s vital signs returning to normal, she was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【14】The patient’s discharge plan involved maintaining the ongoing oral PPI treatment while discontinuing ibuprofen. Additionally, the patient received instructions to refrain from using NSAIDs and to schedule a follow-up appointment with her rheumatologist for further management of her RA.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Ibuprofen is widely used to alleviate pain, inflammation, and fever. Although it is generally considered safe, prolonged or excessive use of ibuprofen can lead to various ADRs. Common ADRs of ibuprofen include stomach pain, nausea, and heartburn. It can also cause GI ulcers, especially in individuals with a history of GI ulcers or bleeding disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 22\\]</u>. Specific polymorphisms in the genes encoding the CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 enzymes can lead to reduced enzyme activity and slower clearance of ibuprofen from the body, increasing the risk of ibuprofen-related ADR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. This is the first report addressing the association between combined CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles with ibuprofen-induced upper GI toxicity in a Saudi patient.\n\n【17】The frequencies of the CYP2C9∗3 allele have been extensively studied and are known to vary significantly across different populations, as reported by the 1000 Genome Phase 3 project 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The European population exhibits a high frequency of the CYP2C9∗3 allele (11%), whereas its occurrence is rare in America (4%) and East Asia (3%) and absent in Africa. Conversely, South Asian populations, such as Pakistan (11.9%) and Bangladesh (11.6%), show a remarkably high prevalence of the CYP2C9∗3 allele. In Western Saudi populations, the presence of the CYP2C9∗3 allele reaches 54%, which is considerably higher than the reported frequencies in other populations (ranging from 0% to 11%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Regarding the CYP2C8∗3 allele, it emerges as the most prevalent variant allele among Europeans (11.2%) and Americans (6.7%). Similarly, in Western Saudi populations, the CYP2C8∗3 allele frequency is approximately 8.57%, accounting for 50.02% of all variant CYP2C8 alleles in Saudis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. In contrast, South Asians (<4%), Africans (2.1%), and East Asians (<1%) exhibit significantly lower frequencies of the CYP2C8∗3 allele. Given the notable prevalence of CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles within the Saudi population, there is a potential concern regarding an increased susceptibility of Saudis to experience ADRs specifically associated with drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 enzymes, including ibuprofen.\n\n【18】A previous study reported that subjects who were double-heterozygous or homozygous for the CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 alleles had significantly low clearance rates for ibuprofen, ranging between 7% and 27% of the average clearance rate for subjects carrying the wild-type alleles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The low clearance rate of individuals carrying the CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles resulted in an increase in ibuprofen plasma concentrations and half-life. Therefore, toxicity may occur more frequently or be more severe at higher plasma concentrations. In patients using ibuprofen, CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles significantly predict the likelihood of developing GI bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Our patient’s genetic test results revealed that the patient was homozygous for both CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles. Therefore, the patient was considered a poor metabolizer of both the CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 enzymes, suggesting that the patient had a poor metabolism of ibuprofen.\n\n【19】In the case of the patient under investigation, ibuprofen was administered at a dosage of 600 mg, resulting in a total daily dose of 1200 mg, which is equal to the established Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for ibuprofen as designated by the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Recent research conducted by Forgerini et al. has demonstrated an increased risk of upper GI bleeding in individuals who carry the CYP2C9∗3 allele and are taking more than 0.5 DDDs of NSAIDs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Considering that our patient was a carrier of the CYP2C9∗3 allele and utilized ibuprofen at a dose more than 0.5 DDD, it indicates an augmented vulnerability to upper GI bleeding at administrated dosage. This finding may imply the existence of a gene-dose effect, where individuals with the CYP2C9∗3 allele are more likely to experience elevated risk and severity of NSAID-induced ADRs.\n\n【20】According to the CPIC guideline concerning CYP2C9 enzyme and NSAIDs, individuals identified as poor metabolizers for CYP2C9 should initiate ibuprofen therapy at a dosage ranging from 25% to 50% of the recommended initial dose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Careful titration of the dose is advised to attain a clinical response and reach a dose between 25% and 50% of the recommended amount. To align with each patient’s treatment objectives, it is recommended to administer ibuprofen for the shortest possible duration using the lowest effective dose. For CYP2C9 poor metabolizers, it is further recommended to consider prescribing alternative NSAIDs that do not undergo metabolism via the CYP2C9 enzyme, such as naproxen, sulindac, aspirin, or other pain management strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Furthermore, caution is warranted when prescribing ibuprofen to patients carrying the CYP2C8∗3 variant allele since the CYP2C8 enzyme also participates in the metabolism of ibuprofen. CPIC recommends a lower ibuprofen dose for CYP2C8 poor metabolizers. While the CYP2C8∗3 allele alone may not significantly reduce ibuprofen clearance, it is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the CYP2C9∗2 allele, resulting in impaired ibuprofen metabolism and elevated plasma levels of the drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence ibuprofen metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The choice of NSAID should be based on the patient’s treatment goals and toxicity risks.\n\n【21】The patient enrolled in our study has been undergoing methotrexate treatment for approximately one year as part of her RA management. Notably, over the past eight weeks, she has been self-administering ibuprofen without a prescribed regimen. Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential risks associated with the simultaneous use of methotrexate and NSAIDs in patients with RA. Multiple studies have consistently demonstrated that the concomitant use of methotrexate and NSAIDs can substantially increase the likelihood of experiencing severe ADRs. These ADRs encompass GI adverse effects, liver toxicity, acute renal failure, and cytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Notably, NSAIDs have been shown to elevate methotrexate levels in the blood, thereby amplifying the associated side effects of methotrexate therapy. A recent case report by Tun et al. documented a rare methotrexate-induced gastric ulcer. This case highlights the potential but rare GI complications arising from methotrexate use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Taking into consideration the patient’s concomitant use of methotrexate and NSAIDs, the upper GI bleeding observed could potentially be attributed to a drug-drug interaction. These findings emphasize the importance of exercising caution and implementing vigilant monitoring when managing patients who are prescribed both methotrexate and NSAIDs concurrently.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】Ibuprofen, a widely utilized NSAID for RA management, has been associated with potential ADRs, including GI ulcers and bleeding. These risks can be influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 genes. Although the CPIC does not recommend routine screening for CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 non-functional alleles before ibuprofen therapy, a comprehensive understanding of these genetic variations can assist in optimizing ibuprofen dosage and reducing the risk of ADRs in RA patients. Therefore, incorporating genetic testing into the clinical decision-making process for NSAID treatment in RA patients has significant implications. It enables personalized medicine approaches, optimizes dosage, minimizes ADRs, and facilitates long-term treatment planning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:16", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:30", "cost": 13.778}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:14"}

Introduction\n\n【3】The Starr-Edwards caged ball heart valve marked a new era in the treatment of valvular heart disease. Complications including thrombosis, thromboebolic events, paravalvular leakage, and pannus formation that occurred in variable frequencies were reported regarding to this artificial valve.

Case Report\n\n【5】A-53-year old man admitted to our institution with exertional dyspnea and angina. He had had aortic valve replacement with Starr-Edwards 2320 model caged ball mechanical valve prosthesis in 1974 and suffered a thromboembolic serebrovascular accident two years ago. His physical examination revealed left hemiparesis with blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 92 beats/min and regular. Cardiac auscultation revealed a 4/6 systolic murmur and rales were heard at the base of the lungs. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a functioning Starr-Edwards caged ball mechanical prosthesis with 30 mmHg gradient and rheumatic mitral valve disease with peak transmitral gradient of 20 mmHg and valve area 1.8 cm<sup>2</sup> and 3-4 degree mitral insufficiency with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with peak pulmonary artery pressure of 68 mmHg, besides there was a pannus formation in the surrounding valvular tissue. Coronary arteriography showed a 90% stenosis at proximal portion of LAD and well functioning caged ball prosthesis . The patient underwent a reoperation of double valve replacement and one vessel coronary artery bypass grafting through a median sternotomy by the help of cardiopulmonary bypass at mild hypothermia. Macroscopic inspection of the excised Starr-Edwards caged ball significant cloth wear and dislodgement were observed inside the struts, showing bare cage metal .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Angiography showing the functioning Star-Edwards Caged ball prosthesis at diastol. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Significant cloth wear and dislodgement and bare cage metal of the excised caged ball prosthesis. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】At reoperation the mitral valve was replaced with a bileaflet prosthesis, St. Jude Medical 29 mm, and an aortotomy was applied because of the previous serebrovascular accident and to examine the pannus formation in the surrounding tissue. After aortotomy we saw that the cloth surrounding the outside was detached from struts and loosened and the Starr-Edwards caged-ball prosthesis was replaced with St. Jude Medical 21 mm bileaflet valve prosthesis to achieve a better hemodynamic performance and a lower INR ratio in the follow-up period. The postoperative course was uneventful. Echocardiogram before discharge confirmed that the prosthetic valves were functioning normally.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】The first Starr-Edwards caged-ball valve was used in mitral position in 1960 and was introduced by Albert Starr in 1961 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Despite complications such as high-pressure gradient, paravalvular leakage, pannus formation, thrombosis and thoromboembolic events that occur in variable frequencies, this artificial valve have been used worldwide in the past decades. With reported long term durability and good hemodynamic performance approximately 200,000 Starr-Edwards caged ball valves with several modifications have been implanted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–6\\]</u>. Nevertheless potential complications of this artificial valve remained a permanent problem. The design of the valve leads to absence of central flow and allows only a lateral flow which results in higher transvalvular gradients. Therefore, the combination of nonphysiological surfaces of the valve and stasis due to higher gradients creates a predisposition for fibrous pannus or thrombus formation. Thrombosis and pannus formation mostly occur at the apex or at the base of the cage either leading to stenosis or stuck valve.\n\n【11】Some authors reported evidence of ball variance for Starr-Edwards caged ball prosthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In our case the patient had still normally functioning Starr-Edwards caged ball valve but at the excision time the cloth surrounding the outside was detached from struts and loosened.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a small vessel vasculitis characterized by lung and kidney involvement. It is typically a disease of white females and has a poor prognosis with the average life expectancy of 5 months for a patient without treatment. Oral and skin ulcers are considered to be rare presentations. Case. A 39-year-old black male presented to the hospital with oral and skin ulcers and was diagnosed with GPA based on the biopsies of both cutaneous lesions and kidney. He was started on rituximab with minimal improvement. Later he was admitted to the ICU and had plasmapheresis, and he gradually improved and was discharged home 8 days after admission. Conclusion. GPA is an aggressive vascular disorder resulting in possible organ system damage and failure. The role of the sickle cell trait in this patient is undefined, but this combination of gender, race, and presenting symptoms in GPA is extremely unusual.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis, is a small vessel vasculitis with systemic manifestations. This disease is characterized by upper and lower respiratory granulomatous inflammation with or without renal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is part of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated small vessel vasculitis which includes Churg–Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, and renal-limited vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. GPA is a rare disease with a prevalence of 3 cases per 100,000 in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The localized form of the disease is predominant in young females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, peaking in the fourth and sixth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. GPA can present as a generalized disease or limited disease. The generalized disease can involve any organ while the localized form is usually limited to lungs, eyes, or ears, but other organs can be involved including the heart. Generalized symptoms such as fever and malaise may be present. Pulmonary symptoms include cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. Renal involvement is usually late and is associated with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Oral mucosa lesions occur in 6–50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Currently, the diagnosis of GPA is based on clinical, serological, and histological findings.\n\n【4】The diagnosis is aided by the presence of serum antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody. In the generalized disease, ANCA can be seen in 80–95% of the patients, but in limited presentations, ANCA can be detected in a range of 60%–80%. If clinical suspicion is high with a negative ANCA test, obtaining a tissue sample for histopathology is required for definitive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our case, we present a male who is seen in the emergency department with cutaneous lesions as the initial presentation of GPA. Our patient initially presented without pulmonary or renal involvement and was diagnosed with GPA following biopsies of oral and cutaneous lesions.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 39-year-old black male with known sickle cell trait presented to the emergency department with lower extremity swelling with blisters and odynophagia. He developed petechial lesions on both feet that progressed to ulcers  on the bilateral lower extremities. The odynophagia started 2 weeks prior to presentation and was associated with a tongue ulcer. He had been evaluated by an infectious disease team during a previous visit and had an unrevealing workup. He was not on any treatment for lower extremity lesions. He denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, night sweats, recent travel, and history of IV drug use.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Ulcer on third and fifth toes .</u>\n\n【8】His initial vital signs were BP 156/86, HR 114, temperature 102.2 F, and O<sub>2</sub> saturation at 98% on room air. Physical exam was remarkable for oral thrush with right tongue ulceration and healing ulcers on the dorsal surface of his feet bilaterally. His complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic profile (BMP) were within normal limits. Urinalysis was positive for blood and 2+ proteinuria. His urine toxicology was positive for oxycodone. He was initially treated for Systemic Inflammatory Response System (SIRS). Blood cultures were drawn and he was started empirically on vancomycin and piperacillin and tazobactam. Bilateral venous duplex was negative for deep vein thrombosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed multiple irregular nodules with suspected infectious versus inflammatory etiology and septic emboli could not be excluded . Transthoracic echocardiogram was negative for infective endocarditis. Bilateral foot ulcers drained serosanguinous fluid with cultures positive for Enterococcus faecalis and Serratia but four sets of blood cultures remained negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left foot was normal and MRI of the right foot showed metatarsal stress reaction versus early osteomyelitis. Skin biopsy showed extensively necrotic fibroadipose tissue with acute inflammation. Right lateral oral tongue ulcerative lesion biopsy showed predominantly hyperplastic squamous mucosa showing an ulcer site and abscess with fragments of necrotic squamous epithelium associated with cytologic atypia and colonies of bacteria, and one fragment of necrotic squamous epithelium displayed vague papillary architecture. The patient later developed right eye conjunctivitis. Appropriate consultations with nephrology, pulmonology, and podiatry were obtained.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CT imaging showing multiple irregular pulmonary nodules (arrow) at different levels. The morphology of these nodules favors infectious/inflammatory nodules more than malignancy. Vasculitis can also have this appearance.</u>\n\n【10】Based on the constellation of oral and cutaneous ulcers, CT chest findings, bilateral foot ulcers, and conjunctivitis, a rheumatologic process was suspected. The antinuclear antibody (ANA) was negative, rheumatoid factor was with 1 : 640 titer, C-ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) was positive with 1 : 1280 titer, and the diagnosis of Wegner’s granulomatosis was made. He was started on rituximab 375 mg weekly and methylprednisolone 250 mg every 6 hours for 3 days. He later had a renal biopsy which showed granulomatosis with polyangiitis and mild interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy and a pauci immune crescentic glomerulonephritis . He underwent debridement of his bilateral foot ulcers and received an additional dose of rituximab. Following the second dose of rituximab, the oral ulcers improved. Toward the end of his hospitalization, his hemoglobin decreased and he was noted to have blood streaked sputum. Repeat CT chest was ordered and was consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage . Unfortunately, he left prior to pulmonology evaluation. He was called and encouraged to come back to the hospital but declined and ultimately sought further medical attention at another hospital where he was ultimately admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Nephrology was consulted and began plasmapheresis for a total of 7 treatments. He was given a one-time dose of cyclophosphamide on initial presentation and then an additional dose of rituximab following plasmapheresis. He gradually improved and was discharged home 8 days after admission.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Light microscopy of a renal biopsy with multiple cores of renal tissue, of which approximately 40% is represented by cortex.

Discussion\n\n【15】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis was first described in 1936 by Wegener 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. GPA was defined by the 2012 Chapel Hill consensus as necrotizing inflammatory vasculitis affecting mainly the small to medium vessels of the upper and lower respiratory tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Gubbels et al. reported that GPA affects a wide age range with a mean age of diagnosis of 40 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. GPA can affect all racial groups but is seen predominantly among Caucasian people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The typical diagnostic criteria were first described by Goldman and Churg in 1954. This includes upper and lower respiratory tract necrotizing granulomas, glomerulonephritis, and systemic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The American College of Rheumatology established criteria for GPA in 1990 which include abnormal urinary sediment, chest radiograph abnormalities, oral ulcers or nasal discharge, and biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The earliest symptoms of the disease are often important clues that guide toward the diagnosis. Kihiczak published a case report in 1994 describing a 36-year-old woman who was diagnosed with sarcoidosis after having conjunctival and nasal mucosal biopsy. Later on, after a prolonged course of symptoms, she was ultimately properly diagnosed with atypical GPA with granulomatous ulcers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Figarella also described a patient who had recurrent nodular lesions on the legs and biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation. Ten years later, pulmonary symptoms developed and a repeat skin biopsy revealed granulomatous vasculitis as the underlying cause for the cutaneous and pulmonary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. While skin lesions occur in 14–50% of patients with GPA, there are no specific cutaneous symptoms for the disease. Lesions can include palpable purpura, skin nodules, skin ulcers, and livedo reticularis. Palpable purpura can be considered as the most common skin manifestation with a prevalence of 35% among patients with GPA and 74% among dermatological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A very rare cutaneous manifestation is pyoderma gangrenosum, defined by skin necrosis and deep ulcers. Kędzierska et al. published a treatment-resistant case that was treated with dapsone and steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Sinovich and Snow also presented a case of a patient with right infra-auricular noduloulcerative lesion that progressed to a periauricular pyoderma gangrenosum that was completely resolved with steroids and azathioprine therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Duna et al. reported that 6–13% of patients with GPA have oral lesions with 2% only have it as a presenting feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. This was one of our patient’s presenting complaints making this case somewhat unusual. The combination of “strawberry gingivitis” with a biopsy showing pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, microabscesses, and multinucleated giant cells with severe systemic symptoms can be diagnostic for GPA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. There have been few reports showing that GPA can affect parotid, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Tongue necrosis is a rare oral symptom with only two previously reported cases.

Data concerning their adverse effects has been lately describing central nervous system (CNS) demyelination process at escalating basis. Case Presentation. A 23-year-old male with autoimmune uveitis and a family history of multiple sclerosis (MS) developed two neurological attacks, after Adalimumab infusion, simultaneously with several cerebral lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hence the diagnosis of Adalimumab induced MS was suspected. Conclusion. This case is reported to tell physicians to be cautious when using anti-TNF-α in patients with family history of MS and to reconsider the risk of MS in patients with autoimmune diseases.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】TNF-α is a well-known proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokine. It mediates inflammatory cell recruitment to the site of the infection by activating endothelial cells. Elevated levels of this cytokine, however, were detected both locally and systemically in patients with inflammatory disorders like arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Drugs that block the effect of TNF-α have shown beyond dispute role in modulating the activity of many autoimmune diseases. Depending on their mechanism of action, anti-TNF-α drugs are divided into monoclonal antibodies (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Golimumab, and Certolizumab) and soluble TNF-α receptors (Etanercept). Many side effects have been recorded during the relatively short history of utilizing anti-TNF-α in the field of autoimmune diseases such as infectious disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, autoimmune disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>, blood dyscrasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>, pulmonary fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, congestive heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> among other adverse effects such as central and peripheral demyelination of the nervous system and optic neuritis.\n\n【4】CNS demyelination was conducted by several reports suggesting triggering or exacerbating demyelination diseases induced by treatment with anti-TNF-α.\n\n【5】In Table 1 we review the most important studies in medical literature concerning this idea.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 </u>\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 23-year-old Arabic gentleman from Syria had a positive family history of MS affecting two of his uncles (maternal and paternal uncles; no blood relationship existed between the parents) and idiopathic epilepsy affecting his sister. His past medical history was positive for chronic autoimmune uveitis since the age of 13. It was then treated with Methotrexate with poor response, and thus it was substituted for combination of Cyclosporine and Azathioprine which achieved a better control. A year ago, Azathioprine was suspended for a while because of the political situation and Adalimumab was initiated. Few days following the second dose of Adalimumab, the patient developed right hemibody anesthesia which lasted two weeks and was successfully treated with intravenous methylprednisolone. Adalimumab was then stopped and both of Azathioprine at a dose of 3 mg/kg and oral prednisolone were initiated. Five months later, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested and revealed multiple periventricular and juxtacortical lesions with high T2 signal intensity along with T2 hypersignal lesion in the spinal cord at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra C4; none of these lesions were contrast enhancing .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a, b, c, and d) Flair MRI slices (axial and coronal slices) show periventricular and juxtacortical high intensity lesions. (e) Axial T2 MRI shows multiple juxtacortical high intensity lesions.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal and negative for oligoclonal bands (OCBs).\n\n【11】Eight months following Adalimumab infusion, the patient had right lower limb paresis which was also successfully treated with methylprednisolone, and normal strength was restored within three weeks. Six months after then, the patient was referred by a rheumatologist to a neurology clinic for consultation and followup though there has been no new attack since then.\n\n【12】Neurological examination was normal except for anisocoria with slightly irregular pupils and bilaterally sluggish reaction to light (an abnormality that was explained by chronic uveitis) with normal fundoscopy and visual acuity. Mild right facial and body hemihypoesthesia, absent abdominal reflexes over the right side, generalized hyperreflexia (+3), and mild right lower limb spasticity were also noticed. To find out the relationship between the uveitis and the neurological attacks, the type of uveitis was reassessed and revealed hints of anterior and intermediate uveitis with no signs of active inflammation. An X-ray of sacroiliac joints and chest X-ray were then requested to rule out both subclinical ankylosing spondylitis and sarcoidosis and were both normal. Brain MRI with contrast was repeated and revealed no new lesions comparing with the previous one .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a and b) Axial T2 MRI shows multiple periventricular and juxtacortical high intensity lesions. (c) Coronal flair MRI shows periventricular and juxtacortical high intensity lesions.</u>\n\n【14】The previous laboratory study was reviewed and showed normal ordinary labs including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatic factor (RF), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies C-ANCA and P-ANCA were all negative. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) analysis revealed HLA-B27. CSF analysis showed acellular fluid with immunoglobulin G (IgG) index of 0.53, normal protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and glucose levels. Despite the lack of enhancement, diagnosis of Adalimumab induced MS was suspected in this patient with HLAB-27 associated uveitis depending on Mcdonald’s criteria for space and time distribution and the temporal relationship between the first neurological attack and drug initiation besides the positive family history of MS. Since there were no active lesions on MRI, treatment plan was continued with no modification and regular clinical and radiological followup was suggested.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】This case describes two separate neurological attacks in a young patient with HLA-B27 associated uveitis and a family history of multiple sclerosis. Although neurological attacks meet Mcdonald’s criteria for time and space distribution, many differential diagnoses are plausible for this presentation, MS with associated uveitis, HLA-B27 associated uveitis and a newly diagnosed MS as two separate entities, and systemic vasculitis induced uveitis and cerebral lesions. Infectious causes and lymphoma, however, are improbable due to the prolonged history and negative laboratory investigations.\n\n【17】A certain type of uveitis, uveitis pars planitis, is considered a manifestation of MS that often precedes or, less often, accompanies the first attacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The type of uveitis was reassessed accordingly and revealed both anterior and intermediate uveitis which is, along with the prolonged history of uveitis, less compatible with MS and more compatible with HLA-B27 uveitis with or without seronegative arthritis such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During 10 years of uveitis, the patient had no arthritis, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin lesions, or even lower back pain. Moreover, AXR of the pelvis revealed no sclerotic changes.\n\n【18】Despite its obscurity, a relationship between MS and autoimmune diseases was deduced because of the high prevalence of MS in patients with autoimmune diseases as suggested by many reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18–20\\]</u>. This speculation added to the positive family history of MS renders this patient highly susceptible to MS. Furthermore, the temporal relationship between the first attack and Adalimumab infusion makes Adalimumab induced or provoked MS the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【19】Suspected MS following anti-TNF-α treatment in patients with family history of MS was reported in many cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 18\\]</u> which recommended that anti-TNF-α should be avoided in such patients and advocated requesting cerebral MRI before treatment initiation in patients with high risk of MS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Several mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the paradox of MS activation in spite of amelioration of systemic inflammation following anti-TNF-α infusion such as the presence of blood brain barrier (BBB). This barrier halts the entry of anti-TNF-α drugs to CNS. Meanwhile, these drugs enhance T cell receptor signaling and the functionality of antigen presenting cells and, consequently, they activate CNS demyelination. This is the essence of lack of entry theory. Presence of BBB was also the culprit in sponge theory wherein TNF-α is supposed to be drawn out of joint synovial fluid following TNF-α antagonism whereas BBB prevents this process in CNS. Thus TNF-α gradient develops across BBB and results in upregulation of TNF-α receptor expression in CNS. Moreover, severely destructed BBB in experimental autoimmune encephalopathy mice models besides the high dose used have been supposed to facilitate anti-TNF-α entry to CNS and permit the subsequent amelioration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Other theories hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is a potential regenerator of oligodendrocytes. Hence blocking TNF-α may prevent this natural mechanism and suppress remyelination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Another hypothesis postulated that anti-TNF-α drugs promote interferon γ (INF-γ) expression and this in turn disturbs the balance between INF-β and INF-γ levels which triggers demyelination process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Whether the precise mechanism is uncovering or inducing demyelination is still undetermined.\n\n【21】Although some points argue against MS such as OCBs negativity and the lack of contrast enhancement, MS negative OCBs are a well-established entity that represents 20–30% of MS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Moreover, OCBs could be detected later on during the circumstance of MS. No clear data is available regarding frequency of OCBs negativity in anti-TNF-α induced MS since most of the reports of similar cases did not mention the results of OCBs analysis. The lack of enhancement, however, may be explained by the time window between performing MRI and the clinical attacks; such window would have guaranteed the resolution of enhancement if it existed in addition to treatment with Azathioprine, a drug that has been accepted as a disease modifying treatment of MS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Asymptomatic cerebral lesions highly suggestive of MS are widely described in patients with family history of MS under the title of radiographically isolated syndrome (RIS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 28\\]</u>, but explicit clinical attacks turn RIS into clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or MS. Most of the reported cases depicted several months of using anti-TNF-α agents preceding the development of clinical attacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 16\\]</u>, while in this case development of the first clinical attack took place days following the second dose, a period that suggests a process of uncovering latent MS rather than inducing it. Even though second clinical attack occurred approximately eight months after halting Adalimumab, MRI performed six months later revealed no active disease; consequently no treatment modification was suggested, and if hints of clinical or radiological activity are noticed later on, Rituximab would be the treatment of choice of both uveitis and MS.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】MS is highly expected in patients with family history of MS and, to a lesser degree, in patients with autoimmune diseases, and physician should consider such risks in patients who are eligible for anti-TNF treatment by detailed history, examination, and close followup as well as performing MRI prior to therapy initiation in highly suspected individuals.\n\n【25】#### Abbreviations\n\n| TNF-α: | Tumor necrosis factor α |\n| --- | --- |\n| CNS: | Central nervous system |\n| MS: | Multiple sclerosis |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| VEP: | Visually evoked potentials |\n| CSF: | Cerebrospinal fluid |\n| OCBs: | Oligoclonal bands |\n| ESR: | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate |\n| CRP: | C-reactive protein |\n| ANA: | Antinuclear antibodies |\n| RF: | Rheumatic factor |\n| ANCA: | Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies |\n| HLA: | Human leukocyte antigen |\n| IgG: | Immunoglobulin G |\n| LDH: | Lactate dehydrogenase |\n| IBD: | Inflammatory bowel disease |\n| BBB: | Blood brain barrier |\n| TNFR2: | Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 |\n| INF: | Interferon |\n| RIS: | Radiographically isolated syndrome |\n| CIS: | Clinically isolated syndrome. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Abbreviations\n\nTNF-α:\tTumor necrosis factor α\nCNS:\tCentral nervous system\nMS:\tMultiple sclerosis\nMRI:\tMagnetic resonance imaging\nVEP:\tVisually evoked potentials\nCSF:\tCerebrospinal fluid\nOCBs:\tOligoclonal bands\nESR:\tErythrocyte sedimentation rate\nCRP:\tC-reactive protein\nANA:\tAntinuclear antibodies\nRF:\tRheumatic factor\nANCA:\tAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\nHLA:\tHuman leukocyte antigen\nIgG:\tImmunoglobulin G\nLDH:\tLactate dehydrogenase\nIBD:\tInflammatory bowel disease\nBBB:\tBlood brain barrier\nTNFR2:\tTumor necrosis factor receptor 2\nINF:\tInterferon\nRIS:\tRadiographically isolated syndrome\nCIS:\tClinically isolated syndrome.", "content": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF-α) agents have been widely used in the field of autoimmune diseases and have proved decisive efficacy and relative safety.

A Malaysian study on NTS bacteraemia found that 55 out of 56000 blood cultures collected over four years grew NTS.

Bowel perforation in a pregnant patient with COVID-19 infection is a rarely reported complication. With the uncovering of the different treatment modalities and complications of this disease, this case highlights diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas and limitations in a special population. Clinical Presentation. A 35-year-old female, Gravida 2 Para 1 at 31 weeks age of gestation (AOG) who underwent cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status in 2019, was admitted for severe COVID-19 infection presenting with dyspnea. During her hospitalization, she developed progressive dyspnea from worsening of COVID-19 infection. Patient was eventually intubated and was given a total of two doses of tocilizumab, adequate antibiotic treatment, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. An emergency repeat cesarean section was performed due to maternal deterioration and poor variability of the fetus. She delivered to a live preterm baby girl, with an Apgar score of 1 and 7 on the 1st and 5th minute of life respectively. During the postoperative days, patient remained intubated and sedated. Increasing residuals were noted per nasogastric tube (NGT). Serial scout film of the abdomen (SFA) and medical management were performed. Upon weaning from sedation, patient complained of right lower quadrant pain. A whole abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast was requested which revealed large bowel obstruction. Patient was referred to surgery service. Upon assessment, abdomen was noted to be rigid with guarding during palpation. A scout film of the abdomen was requested and revealed extensive amount of pneumoperitoneum with scanty to absent colonic gas suggestive of bowel perforation. Patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. Upon opening the peritoneum, free air was evacuated. Approximately 1.4 liters of fecaloid peritoneal fluid was suctioned and adhesive band was noted at the pelvic area. A 2 cm full thickness perforation at the cecum with 17 cm serosal tear from the cecum to ascending colon was noted. Bowel loops proximal to the perforation were dilated. Nasogastric tube was inserted for bowel decompression. Right hemicolectomy was performed. Specimen was sent for histopathology. Acute inflammatory cells infiltrating the blood vessels and possible microthrombi and beginning thrombus formation were noted in the subserosa. Patient eventually expired on the 14<sup>th</sup> hospital day from sepsis. Conclusion. This case highlights a rarely reported complication of COVID-19 infection. Confluence of factors that predisposed the patient include pregnancy, COVID-19 infection, use of tocilizumab, and recent surgery. High index of suspicion is vital in the management and improvement of outcomes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), was initially characterized with respiratory symptoms. However, patients with severe to critical COVID-19 infection are at a particularly high risk for developing gastrointestinal complications due to prolonged hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Pregnant people may be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 because the physiologic changes of pregnancy involve alterations in immune system, which may result in an altered response to infection during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Morelli et al. in 1953 were the first to propose the concept of immune tolerance during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. They hypothesized that the semi allogeneic fetus is able to survive due to regulation of the immunologic interactions between the mother and the fetus. Such regulation can be caused by a lack of fetal antigen expression and/or functional suppression of maternal immune response which could possibly predispose a pregnant patient to severe COVID-19 infection.\n\n【5】The conception of different therapeutic modalities for this disease has been evolving. The COVID-19 treatment guidelines panel recommends against withholding treatment for COVID-19 infection in a pregnant patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Termination of pregnancy and mode of delivery are also important issues in this population. Cesarean delivery should not be considered medically reasonable until it becomes, ethically or medically obligatory for either maternal or fetal indications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【6】This is a case of bowel perforation in a 35-year-old female patient with critical COVID-19 infection with no past history of gastrointestinal disease.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 35-year-old female, Gravida 2 Para 1 at 31 weeks age of gestation (AOG) who underwent cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status in 2019, coming in for dyspnea. She had no history of gastrointestinal disease and had no COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n【9】At the time of admission, the patient was conscious, coherent, and in mild cardiorespiratory distress and with desaturation as low as 88% at room air. Examination of the chest revealed bibasal crackles. The abdomen was globular, normoactive, with palpable good fetal movement and good fetal heart tones were appreciated, and was nontender on all quadrants. She was initially managed as a case of severe COVID-19 infection and was given adequate antibiotics, a total of two doses of tocilizumab, remdesivir, and dexamethasone.\n\n【10】During her admission, patient had progression of dyspnea and hemodynamic instability, hence intubation was performed. It was also noted that the fetus had poor variability in the fetal cardiotocogram. A decision was made to perform an emergency repeat cesarean section. She delivered to a live preterm baby girl, with an Apgar score of 1 and 7 on the 1st and 5th minute of life respectively. Apgar score 1, 7 with a birth weight of 1520 grams. After the first week of admission, residuals of 150 milliliters per nasogastric tube (NGT) with no bowel movement for 3 days was noted. Medical management was conducted. Serial scout film of the abdomen (SFA) revealed only the presence of ileus with no evidence of pneumoperitoneum .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Serial scout film of the abdomen. Description: regression of ileus; there is a decrease in number and amount of air-filled small bowel segments with no organizing pattern.</u>\n\n【12】While weaning from sedation, she complained of right lower quadrant pain. On assessment, abdomen was soft but with direct tenderness at the right lower quadrant with consideration of possible appendicitis. Hence, A whole abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast  was requested which revealed large bowel obstruction. Patient was then referred to surgery service.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Whole abdominal CT scan with contrast.

A scout film of the abdomen  was requested and revealed extensive amount of free intraperitoneal air  with lucency in the subdiaphragmatic area (as pointed by the red arrow). The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Scout film of the abdomen.

Approximately 1.4 liters of fecaloid peritoneal fluid was suctioned and adhesive band was noted at the pelvic area. A 2 cm full thickness perforation at the cecum with 17 cm serosal tear from the cecum to ascending colon was noted. Bowel loops proximal to the perforation were dilated. Bowel decompression was performed via NGT. Right hemicolectomy was performed. Specimen (terminal ileum to proximal transverse colon) was sent for histopathology  which revealed acute inflammatory cells infiltrating the blood vessels and possible microthrombi and beginning thrombus formation were noted in the subserosa.

Discussion\n\n【19】Pregnant women do not appear to have an increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection. However, those who are infected  seem to be at higher risk  for developing severe illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Majority of symptomatic gravid COVID-19 patients were at their third trimester of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In a study conducted by Allotey et al. it was reported that the prevalence of all-cause mortality was 0.63%, severe COVID-19 was 13%, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) was 4%, and pregnant women requiring invasive ventilation was at 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. For the fetal considerations, impact of prolonged maternal hypoxemia, which may be significant, given the protracted clinical course of COVID-19, balanced against the risks associated with delivery at a given gestational age. The fetal risks associated with prematurity are well known and decrease with increasing gestational age at delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Failure to perform cesarean delivery when this deliberative clinical judgment is justified increases risk of harm, bothto the fetus and the pregnant patient. Hence, ethically speaking, the mother may be allowed to subject herself and the fetus to a reasonable risk for their mutual benefit.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Blood vessel infiltrated with acute inflammatory cells and areas in the subserosa with possible microthrombi and beginning thrombus formation.</u>\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 Serosal congestion and periappendicitis.</u>\n\n【22】Although adhesions from previous abdominal surgery could have predisposed the patient to developing bowel obstruction leading to subsequent bowel perforation, we explored other contributory factors that led to this complication.\n\n【23】Throughout pandemic it appears that patients with COVID-19 fulfill the classic Virchow’s triad required for development of thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Endothelial injury associated with immune complex-mediated vasculitis has also been postulated as one of the mechanisms behind vascular damage in COVID-19. Both of these in combination can cause endothelial dysfunction and predispose a patient to thrombus formation. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state with increased thrombin production and increase in intravascular inflammation. During pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, such as plasmin, and these may be implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pregnant women are at increased risk of thromboembolic events with associated mortality. Therefore, pregnant women with COVID-19 may have additive or synergistic risk factors for thrombosis. Stasis can be expected in all critically ill patients because of isolation in a confined area, prolonged bed rest, immobilization in the intensive care unit, and possible limitations to physiotherapy. Lastly, although not part of Virchow’s triad, hemodynamic instability in severe COVID-19 infection leading to hypotension and shock can be a possible mechanism of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia seen in these patients.\n\n【24】Another possible but rare etiology for bowel perforation is the use of tocilizumab infusion. Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist that is being used for the profound inflammatory state associated with COVID-19 infection. In mice, interleukin-6 stimulates intestinal epithelial proliferation, decreases intestinal injury, and improves barrier function following ischemia reperfusion of the small bowel. Interleukin-6 null mice exhibited impaired recovery following massive enterectomy and increased apoptosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore, tocilizumab may interfere with recovery from intestinal injuries caused by diverticulitis or other gastrointestinal conditions.\n\n【25】Pregnant women with COVID-19 infection had worse consequences compared with nonpregnant women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In critically ill patients with COVID-19, prognosis is poor with mortality ranging from 12 to 78% with a mean average of 25 to 50 percent, and 92% of the deaths occurring within the immediate postoperative days due to multiorgan failure or refractory septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Our patient was pregnant with COVID-19 infection. The modulations of the maternal immune system in pregnancy may affect the response to infections, and specifically to viruses. The altered inflammatory response to viruses during pregnancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by the certain mechanisms which can predispose the patient to severe to critical COVID-19 infection in pregnancy necessitating an emergency repeat cesarean section delivery because of deteriorating maternal status which predisposed her to developing adhesions. These adhesions could have predisposed the patient to developing large bowel obstruction and subsequent bowel perforation. Pregnancy placed the patient in a hypercoagulable state that may lead to formation of microthrombi causing ileus. Other factor such as recent surgery could also lead to ileus, which again could lead to large bowel obstruction and subsequent bowel perforation. In severe to critical COVID-19, tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 antagonist, is used on compassionate grounds for treatment of COVID-19 cytokine storm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In a study conducted by Nakajima et al. they noted that there is no increased rates of spontaneous abortion or congenital abnormalities secondary to exposure to tocilizumab during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. However, tocilizumab may interfere with recovery from injuries due to impaired intestinal cell proliferation leading to bowel ulceration. Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation is an uncommon but serious adverse effect in tocilizumab therapy.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【28】The modulations of the maternal immune system in pregnancy may affect the response to infections, and specifically to viruses. Pregnant women do not appear to have an increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection. However, those who are infected seem to be at higher risk for developing severe illness. Patients with severe COVID-19 are at a particularly high risk for developing gastrointestinal complications.

This condition poses a latent risk of bed sores. To prevent those complications, we used electroacupuncutre for decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage. A 51-year-old man complained of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticate rigidity. Prior to electroacupuncture, his decorticate rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium and baclofen. However, his rigidity had not improved. This patient received total 41 sessions of electroacupuncture. The patient’s Modified Ashworth’s Scale changed from 4 at baseline to 2 after the treatment, indicating an improvement in the rigidity of the upper limbs. Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale and passive ROM of the elbow joints also improved. We report the observed effects of electroacupuncture for decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage.

Case History\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Patient Characteristics and Diagnosis\n\n【6】A 51-year-old man complaining of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage was admitted to the Department of Cardiovascular and Neurological Diseases of Kyung Hee University Oriental Medicine Hospital. This patient had collapsed during a marathon and had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The doctors recognized acute myocardial infarction (MI) and provided conventional therapies for this condition. However, anoxic brain damage was caused by insufficient blood supply to the brain. He manifested rigidity, dyspnea, and dysphagia. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticate rigidity. Although this patient had underlying hypertension and diabetes mellitus, he and his family had not recognized these conditions until onset of MI. At admission, he revealed GCS score 7 (E4 V0 M3) and used tracheostomy tube, nasogastric tube. The brain computed tomography (CT) image taken at admission  revealed severe cerebral cortical atrophy. Laboratory data did not reveal abnormal values for all items. He was admitted to Kyung Hee University Oriental Medicine Hospital 3 months after onset. Prior to his admission, his decorticate rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium (25 mg) and baclofen (5 mg). However, his rigidity had not improved, and his condition had remained the same since onset.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | The brain computed tomography (CT) image at onset and admission time.

Treatment\n\n【9】Electro-acupuncture was performed as a therapy for symptoms of decorticated rigidity of the upper limbs. Daily electro-acupuncture treatment was performed between 14:00 and 15:00 for 41 consecutive days (PG-306, Japan). The acupoints used in this case were LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4, bilaterally. The following conditions were used: stimulation wave, biphasic (60 Hz); pulse duration, 0.4 ms; and stimulation strength, low. The electrical stimulation power was the same for each treatment (Pulse Generator PG-306, Suzuki Inc. Japan). The patient’s elbow joints and wrists showed mild movement during electro-acupuncture therapy. Each treatment procedure lasted 20 min and was performed by skilled specialists (Korean Medicine Doctor (KMD)) by using stainless steel acupuncture needles (Dongbang Acupuncture Inc. Korea; 40 mm (length) × 0.25 mm (diameter)). Furthermore, Bojungikgitang, a Korean herbal medicine decoction, is administered to control general condition of this patient. There was no change in total daily dose of dantrolene sodium and baclofen before and after electro-acupuncture treatment.\n\n【10】##### 2.3. Evaluation Methods\n\n【11】We used 3 methods to evaluate the effect of electro-acupuncture on the patient’s rigidity: the Modified Ashworth’s Scale (MAS)  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, and the measurement of the passive range of motion (ROM) of the elbow joints.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 The Modified Ashworth’s Scale for grading spasticity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.</u>\n\n【14】##### 2.4.

The initial MAS score of 4 improved slightly during the procedure: the first improvement in this score (3 points) was observed after the 6th treatment, and a further improvement to 2 points was noted by the time of the 24th treatment. The MAS score remained at 2 points at the last session . The initial Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale score of 3 fell to 2 points after the 6th treatment.

Abnormal posturing is an involuntary flexion or extension of the arms and legs, indicating severe brain injury. Decorticate rigidity exhibited as flexion of the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs indicates damage in the cerebral hemispheres, the internal capsule, and the thalamus. Our patient’s rigidity was a result of anoxic brain damage due to myocardial infarction.\n\n【22】This patient exhibited flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticated rigidity. This patient was diagnosed with anoxic brain damage on the basis of his medical history, symptoms, and brain imaging. Although he had been treated with conventional therapies for rigidity (muscle relaxants and physical therapy) after diagnosis, his symptoms did not improve before he was admitted to KyungHee University Oriental Medicine Hospital. The patient’s family and caregiver had trouble in moving the patient owing to his severe rigidity. Furthermore, his rigidity made it difficult to change his position for preventing the formation of decubitus ulcers, and this patient was at latent risk of bedsores.\n\n【23】Several studies have shown that electro-acupuncture can treat rigidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. One of these studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> has suggested that high-frequency and low-strength electro-acupuncture on LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 can reduce rigidity of the upper limbs in stroke patients. Because the rigidity of the upper limbs of stroke patients exhibits a flexion, the authors of this study used acupoints LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 to stimulate the arm extensor muscle group, which is an antagonist of the arm flexor muscle group. Although the diagnosis of the present case was anoxic brain damage, we observed a form of rigidity in this patient that was similar to that in stroke patients, namely, flexion of the upper limbs. As mentioned above, conventional therapy did not improve his rigidity. Thus, we used electro-acupuncture therapy based on the previous study in stroke patients (acupoints LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 and a high-frequency/low strength stimulation method (60 Hz, 0.4 ms pulse duration, and low strength)) to relieve our patient’s arm rigidity symptoms.\n\n【24】In the present study, the patient’s upper limb rigidity gradually improved during the follow-up period. The MAS score and Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale improved at both the 6th and 24th sessions. The passive ROM of both elbow joints also improved during the 41 sessions, and notably, the passive ROM of the left elbow joint showed a normal value at the endpoint. Therefore, we believe that electro-acupuncture was effective for treating this patient’s upper limb rigidity.\n\n【25】In general, anoxic brain damage which results in coma causes a vegetative state, and these patients will remain in a vegetative state until death. Therefore, prognosis of anoxic brain damage is very poor. And patients who reveal decorticate rigidity are in a coma or vegetative state and have poor prognoses, with risks for cardiac or respiratory arrest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, in this case, there were improvements in upper limbs rigidity due to anoxic brain damage. Thus, we could make it easy to move a patient and to change the patient’s position to prevent a decubitus ulcer and related complications such as pneumonia. We think that the use of electro-acupuncture for decorticate rigidity not only decreased tone of muscle of upper limbs but also prevented complications.\n\n【26】Baclofen is used to treat rigidity in conventional drug treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. However, patients who have nephropathy cannot use baclofen owing to its toxicity; moreover, a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> has suggested that patients on dialysis are exposed to nephrotoxicity during baclofen intake. Therefore, baclofen cannot be used to treat rigidity in patients who have nephropathy. We believe that electro-acupuncture may be an alternative for treating decorticate rigidity in elderly people undergoing dialysis. In our case, treatment with conventional therapy (drugs and physical therapy) for decorticate rigidity did not result in improvement, but improvement was noted in the rigidity of the upper limbs after treatment with electro-acupuncture. Therefore, we propose that electro-acupuncture is a therapeutic option in patients who show no improvement despite therapy.\n\n【27】A limitation of the present case study is that we could not treat the rigidity of the lower limbs. The patient’s lower limbs exhibited extension, but we could not find any studies in the literature that provided therapeutic methods for lower-limb rigidity. In addition, because the symptoms of the lower limbs were less severe than those of the upper limbs at the time of admission, we concentrated our efforts on treating the rigidity of the upper limbs. Studies that provide data about treating lower-limb rigidity are required in the future. Furthermore, additional research is needed to determine the efficacy of electro-acupuncture on decorticate rigidity.\n\n【28】In summary, 41 days of electro-acupuncture treatment of LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 improved the rigidity of the upper limbs in patients with anoxic brain damage. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions based on a case study of only 1 patient, we propose that further studies would help determine whether electro-acupuncture is a plausible alternative in the treatment of decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in patients with anoxic brain damage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:53:55", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:13", "cost": 18.415}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:53:54"}

Insufficiency fractures of pubic rami are rare occurrences in association with total hip arthroplasty (THA). Postoperative stress fractures occur due to increase of patients activity following years of disability. The physician should consider the possibility of a pelvic insufficiency fracture in patients with RA after THA, if the patients present with groin pain. We demonstrate here the first case of bilateral insufficiency fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone following THA.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】THA is effective for decreasing pain and improving the loss of function. Acute hip pain within the first few years after THA is unusual when the components are correctly positioned. The differential diagnosis, dislocation, infection, and periarticular bursitis or tendinitis, are considered. Insufficiency fracture around components also should be considered as part of differential diagnosis.\n\n【4】Several reports showed cases of insufficiency fracture of pubic rami after THA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. However, insufficiency fracture of bilateral pubic rami and iliac bone following THA has never been reported. Here, we report a case of a patient who complained of bilateral pelvic pain following bilateral THA who was found to have bilateral insufficiency fractures of pubic rami and iliac bone.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 62-year-old woman suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) underwent a left THA in 2007 and a right revision THA in 2009. The patient was treated with various doses of glucocorticoid for long term. After surgery, she was able to walk without support. However, ten months postoperatively, she presented with complaints of left groin pain that initially was associated with physical therapy sessions. The symptoms became more constant. She denied a history of a fall or of another traumatic event. Radiographs, at that time, did not show any significant findings. She was treated with anti-inflammatory medication and weight-bearing with use of a cane in the right hand. Over the next 2 months, the left groin pain was disappeared. After 4 month, the left pubic pain was recurrent. She did weight-bearing with use of a cane in the right hand again. However, she presented right groin pain several days later. Symptoms were worse with weight bearing and walking. Furthermore, several days later, both sides of buttock pain were presented and unable to walk.\n\n【7】Radiographs showed fractures of both pubic rami. Computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone . Evaluation for metabolic bone disease was performed. There was no significant evidence evaluated by blood examination.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | CT image showing pelvis.

By this time, all symptoms had subsided.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Stress fractures are classified into three subgroups: fatigue fracture caused by repetitive stress for normal bone, insufficiency fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile bone, and pathologic fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile invaded bone by tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Zwartelé et al. reported systematic reviews of cementless THA in RA patients, and they concluded that cementless acetabular cups were rarely associated with mechanical complications including acetabular fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, Fukunishi et al. reported that 11 patients in 171 RA patients (6.4%) who underwent cemented THA suffered from pubic rami fractures postoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Isdale reported the bone quality in RA patients was poor, and insufficiency fractures of the pubic rami in RA appear to be more common than had been recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our case, the subtype of stress fracture is thought to be classified into insufficiency fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile bone due to RA. The bone quality of this patient might be poor, because the patient was treated with glucocorticoid for long term.\n\n【13】The patient performed revision THA by using Kerboull-type acetabular reinforcement device. Several reports demonstrated the results postoperatively using Kerboull-type acetabular reinforcement device 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. However, there was no report of pubic rami fracture after THA. Therefore, the fracture may not be associated with acetabular component design.\n\n【14】Most pelvic insufficiency fractures occur in women, particularly those with osteoporotic bone. The patients have impaired activity levels prior to THA. After surgery, many of these patients are pain free and get activity at a much higher level than preoperatively. Therefore, they are susceptible to the development of an insufficiency fracture if the bone quality is poor. In our case, the mechanism of fracture is thought as follows. Firstly, the insufficiency fracture of left pubic rami occurred due to daily activity. The patient was placed on limited weight-bearing, with use of a cane in the right hand. This increased the stress on the right side, and the fracture of right pubic rami was occurred. Both sides of pubic fracture increased the stress on both iliac bone, and the fractures of both iliac bones were caused.\n\n【15】Insufficiency fractures are differentiated from acute fractures, which occur early in the postoperative period as a result of press-fit insertion of cementless acetabular components in osteopenic bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The physician should consider the possibility of a pelvic insufficiency fracture in patients with RA after THA. If the patient presents with groin pain, the patient should be treated with weight-bearing as conservative management.\n\n【17】However, pelvic discontinuity by both pubic rami and iliac bone fracture occurred in our case; even we recommended weight-bearing at the time of initial fracture of left pubic rami. We reported the first case of bilateral insufficiency fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone following THA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:55:27", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:55:36", "cost": 8.898}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:55:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:55:26"}

Necrotizing Sarcoid Granulomatosis (NGS) is a rare and little-known form of disease, which also presents nodular lung lesions, and it shares pathologic and clinical findings with sarcoidosis, where the presence of necrosis may lead to misdiagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), leading to a consequent delay in treatment of the underlying entity (Chong et al. 2015). This is exactly what happened with the two cases that we present here.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Presentation\n\n【3】Case 1 was a 24-year-old woman who was 37 weeks pregnant, referred to our Internal Medicine unit because of a deep supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on the left side whose fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) revealed granulomas with necrosis. Case 2 was a 31-year-old male with neurological symptoms (bradypsychia, peripheral vertigo, weakness in right lower limb, instability, and sphincter incontinence), whose cerebral nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed the presence of meningeal uptake; chest tomography scan (CT) showed mediastinal nodules and bilateral bronchoalveolar infiltrates; and the open lung biopsy showed sarcoid-like granulomas with extensive necrosis. Both patients received initially standard antituberculous treatment, but due to lack of response, the possibility of a necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis raised up. After the start of treatment with glucocorticoids, the evolution was favourable in both cases.

Discussion\n\n【7】Necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis was first described in 1973 by Liebow, who noted the histological presence of confluent epithelioid granulomas with small central necrosis foci or more extensive necrosis, as well as vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Liebow diferentiated this granulomatous disease from other forms of noninfectious pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis: Wegener’s granulomatosis, Churg–Strauss syndrome, bronchocentric granulomatosis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Actually most authors consider the entity as a form of sarcoidosis more than a distinct entity, differing in the fact that there is more intense necrosis and vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Clinically, very few differences have been described between the two variants: classical and necrotizing, with pulmonary involvement predominating in both. Table 2 provides more detail on differences between them. In case 1, the clinical manifestation was a supraclavicular lymphadenopathy; peripheral lymphadenopathy appears in 40% of sarcoidosis patients. It should be noted that the presence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathies is more frequent in the classic form (85%) than in the necrotizing form (33%). In case 2, the predominant manifestation was central nervous system (CNS) involvement, which appears in 5.78% of NGS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and in the same proportion in patients with the classic form 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Characteristics of classical variant (nodular sarcoidosis) and necrotizing variant (NGS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>.</u>\n\n【10】In respect of tuberculosis, the most frequent clinical presentation is also pulmonary involvement. The most frequent extrapulmonary form is lymph node tuberculosis, which is responsible for 43% of peripheral lymphadenopathies in the developed world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>; CNS involvement is rarer (5.5%); due to this, it requires haematogenous dissemination either from a distal focus or during disseminated TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Correct diagnosis is vital because of the different treatments for the pathologies. Necrotizing sarcoidosis has a good response to corticoids, becoming benign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>, and exceptionally severe neural involvement leading to death has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In contrast, tuberculosis disease requires TB treatment over a period of time that depends on the area affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Given the low effectiveness of cultures from most extrapulmonary locations for studying extrapulmonary tuberculosis, biopsy may be required for diagnosis. Visualising granulomas with caseification necrosis in biopsy samples, together with a compatible medical history, is practically diagnostic. Even so, samples should always be processed for microbiological study (staining, PCR, and culturing). A lack of microbiological isolation in the samples should therefore lead us to suspect a different granulomatous disease, such as necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Similarly, in patients suspected of having an active tuberculosis infection (based on clinical radiological findings), it is recommended to initiate the antituberculous regimen prior to microbiological isolation and evaluate the response after 2-3 weeks, while the microbiological results are being prepared. If there are no clinical or radiological changes and the microbiological study is negative, steroid therapy can be started 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【14】In the two cases presented here, TB treatment was initiated. Given the absence of a favourable response, it was performed a biopsy that led to the diagnosis, allowing corticoid treatment to be initiated. In both patients, good disease control was achieved with low doses of corticoids, combined with methotrexate in case 2, permitting rapid reduction in prednisone doses.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【16】Necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis should be considered within the differential diagnosis of granulomatous diseases , and knowledge of this variant is essential in order not to rule out sarcoidosis due to the presence of necrosis. The extended duration of the disease, its glucocorticoid response, negative cultures, and lack of response to TB treatment make it less likely for the aetiology to be infectious 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 Main differential diagnosis of NGS and their typical characteristics.

As class III obesity leads to hip joint deterioration, black women frequently present for orthopedic care. Weight loss associated with bariatric surgery should lead to enhanced success of hip replacements. However, we present a case of a black woman who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with the expectation that weight loss would make her a better surgical candidate for hip replacement. Her gastric bypass was successful as her BMI declined from 52.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. However, her hip circumference after weight loss remained persistently high. Therefore, at surgery the soft tissue tunnel geometry presented major challenges. Tunnel depth and immobility of the soft tissue interfered with retractor placement, tissue reflection, and surgical access to the acetabulum. Therefore a traditional cup placement could not be achieved. Instead, a hemiarthroplasty was performed. After surgery her pain and reliance on external support decreased. But her functional independence never improved. This case demonstrates that a lower BMI after bariatric surgery may improve the metabolic profile and decrease anesthesia risk, but the success of total hip arthroplasties remains problematic if fat mass in the operative field (i.e. high hip circumference) remains high.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】According to NHANES 2009-2010, the prevalence of class III obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in black, white, Hispanic, and Mexican American women is 18.0%, 7.3%, 6.1%, and 6.7%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. For men, the prevalence also varies by ethnicity but is lower than 8% in all groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Due to their high rate of obesity, black women are highly likely to come to the attention of orthopedic surgeons after bariatric surgery for hip replacement. Bariatric surgery is associated with many benefits including the eradication or improvement of hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and obstructive sleep apnea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. All of these metabolic changes lead to decreased risk of anesthesia and postsurgical metabolic complications. But in our urban orthopedic clinic, we are observing persistently high hip circumferences in black women, even after major weight loss (MMM). Therefore we frequently encounter an unpublished and unexpected orthopedic risk: inadequate loss of subcutaneous fat in the operative field. To demonstrate the challenges, a representative case is presented.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】With the expectation that her back and hip pain would resolve, a 51-year-old black woman, with a BMI of 52.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Within three years she achieved a BMI of 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. At this lower BMI, she reported that her back pain had improved but due to persistent severe right hip pain, her ability to ambulate remained compromised. She requested surgical relief.\n\n【6】At her preoperative orthopedic evaluation, she had a Harris Hip Score of 17, and even though her BMI was 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, her hip circumference was proportionately much higher. Preoperative photographs of her with a BMI of 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were not taken. Photographs from 3 years later when her BMI had increased to 42.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> have been obtained . At the time these photographs were taken, her waist and hip circumferences were 107 cm and 155 cm, respectively. Her overall proportions with a BMI of 42.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were visually similar to her preorthopedic surgery measurements when her BMI was 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | 51-year-old black woman with BMI of 42.0 kg/m2 after bariatric surgery, waist circumference of 107 cm, and hip circumference of 155 cm.

The massive soft tissue mass in the surgical field totally obstructed bony landmarks and precluded both computer and image navigation techniques. She underwent a 4-hour operation during which extensile incisions were utilized to improve access and component positioning. Due to the 15 cm depth of the soft tissue tunnel, combined with the inability to reflect the soft tissue flaps, a traditional cup placement could not be achieved. Therefore, instead of the more optimal total hip replacement, a hemiarthroplasty was performed. Postoperatively, a chronically draining wound which took months to stabilize occurred.\n\n【9】Nonetheless she had transient improvement in hip score. However, her ambulation at 1 and 3 years after hemiarthroplasty was only minimally improved and she is categorized as housebound ambulatory with a Harris Hip Score of 18.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】For the woman presented, bariatric surgery was successful in achieving weight loss so that BMI declined from 52.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. However, her persistently high hip circumference left her with the same technical challenges during hip replacement surgery as if she had not undergone the weight loss intervention. Even with a BMI in the category of class I obese, her body fat distribution was such that a total hip replacement could not be accomplished. Due to the size, shape, and mobility of the soft tissues in the operative field, adequate exposure and access to the acetabular component were not achievable.\n\n【12】This case raises awareness that neither absolute weight nor BMI is sufficient to define whether the subsequent orthopedic risks have been minimized. Attention needs to be paid to the mass of fat in the operative field. Importantly, this large mass of subcutaneous fat can be predicted preoperatively by simply measuring hip circumference and performing hip axial imaging by CT . Consistent with our clinical experience, the importance of hip circumference as a way to predict high body fat content has recently been validated. The ratio of hip circumference to height known as the Body Adiposity Index (BAI), has been shown to be superior to BMI as a measure of body fat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> (Body Adiposity Index = (hip circumference/(height<sup>1.5</sup>)) − 18).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | CT imaging to demonstrate soft tissue geometry and gravitational changes with position.

Women have more subcutaneous fat than men and black women have more subcutaneous fat than white women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Therefore even after successful weight loss black women are likely to continue to have a relatively high volume of subcutaneous fat. To optimize orthopedic outcomes related to total hip replacement, surgeons need to evaluate patients independent of BMI for this possibility and plan accordingly. At this time, bariatric and orthopedic surgeons focus on BMI rather than hip circumference.\n\n【15】We bring this issue forth because there appears to be an absence of appreciation of this issue. A literature search led us to the identification of only two articles discussing hip replacement surgery following bariatric surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Both of these articles described the benefits of bariatric surgery and neither addressed the orthopedic issues we describe. Because extensive fat in the surgical field is so commonly encountered in our practice, we have developed modifications that have been helpful (MMM) . We appreciate the limitations in waist and hip circumference measurements being made 3 years following her hip replacement surgery. However her body mass distribution, including her pear shaped body habitus, was preserved allowing for some of the observations and recommendations we have made. We hope this case presentation will lead to improved outcomes and bring attention to the need to focus not just on BMI but also hip circumference when considering the options for hip arthroplasty.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Modifications to consider for hip arthroplasty with high hip circumference.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:09:37", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:09:49", "cost": 11.694}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:09:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:09:37"}

Adrenal cavernous hemangiomas (AH) are benign nonfunctional vascular tumors rarely discovered as incidental findings on imaging studies or autopsies. This study presents a single case report of AH with another rare finding of the Liesegang ring. Also, we reviewed 73 case reports of cavernous adrenal hemangioma to provide an overview of AH’s clinical characteristics. Case Report. A nonfunctional AH was incidentally discovered in a 59-year-old morbidly obese female patient with a 10-year history of hypertension and thyroidectomy. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a left suprarenal mass of ∼16 cm in diameter. While the patient had no clinical manifestations from the hemangioma, all laboratory tests were within the normal values with no indication of a functional adrenal tumor. The mass was removed by open left adrenalectomy. The microscopic histological examination revealed a laminated structure with wide blood-filled spaces with a central core of necrotic and hemorrhagic changes, characteristic of a cavernous AH with the presence of a rare Liesegang ring. Conclusion. Although rare, AH should be considered as a differential diagnosis for adrenal masses. This is the first reported case of a cavernous AH with rare microscopic findings of the Liesegang ring.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Benign vascular tumor-like growths are commonly seen in the liver and skin tissues. However, the presence of a vascular tumor, cavernous hemangioma, in the adrenal glands is a rare incidental finding often discovered on radiologic imaging (abdominal CT, MRI, or ultrasonography) or autopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Adrenal hemangioma (AH) is a rare benign nonfunctioning tumor developing from the vascular endothelium of the adrenal gland. The first clinical case of the adrenal cavernous hemangioma was published by Johnson and Jeppesen in 1955 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This was a patient presenting with a complaint of sudden-onset hypertension and no symptoms of endocrinal origin. Despite being a rare occurrence, the potential accompanying endocrinal manifestations make it imperative to study the tumor and identify its characteristic features that may help in making a diagnosis.\n\n【4】Usually unilateral, AH is observed later in life (after the fifth decade) with female preponderance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. We report a case of an incidental adrenal hemangioma with a rare microscopic finding of the Liesegang ring found on the abdominal computed tomography (CT) of a 59-year-old female patient.\n\n【5】There are about 73 case reports of AH available from the year 1955 to date. Evidence of Liesegang ring has been reported with fibrotic, cystic, necrosed, or inflamed tissue of the skin, conjunctiva, female genital tract, or kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Liesegang rings are formed as a result of precipitation occurring over time in highly saturated solutions. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of AH with histological evidence of a Liesegang ring. Following the case report, the authors also present a brief and comprehensive review of the reported cases of AH so far.\n\n【6】#### 2\\.

The patient had no other complaints or clinical signs that may be attributed to adrenal (medullary or cortical) overactivity, and the physical examination had no abnormality. Laboratory tests, including urine tests for 24-hour fractionated metanephrine, were within normal limits.\n\n【8】Pre- and postcontrast abdominal CT scans  revealed a large heterogeneous solid left adrenal gland mass with internal calcifications and central necrosis. Postcontrast showed peripheral nodular discontinuous enhancement . The mass caused a significant mass effect on the left kidney, which is pushed inferiorly.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Pre- and postcontrast CT scan of the abdomen: large heterogeneous solid left adrenal mass (M) with internal calcifications and peripheral discontinuous enhancement after contrast (arrows in B and D). Note. Significant mass effect of the left kidney which is pushed inferiorly.</u>\n\n【10】The mass was removed through an open approach via a supraumbilical midline incision. It was well-circumscribed and has no signs of local invasion to the adjacent structures. The gross pathological examination showed an intact mass covered by a smooth and glistening capsule, measuring 16 × 15 × 10 cm and weighing 1.73 kg. On cut-section, the mass showed cystic areas with extensive hemorrhage and yellow areas, suggestive of necrosis. The residual adrenal gland could be identified .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 The gross examination of adrenal hemangioma (a) before and (b) after slicing, on the cut section, shows a cystic area with extensive hemorrhage.</u>\n\n【12】On histological examination, the specimen consisted mainly of infarcted, necrotic tissue with cyst-like vascular spaces that were expanded due to collection of blood and were lined by a single layer of mature endothelial cells, without atypia or mitosis. The stroma showed extensive fibrinous material in which many Liesegangs rings were observed. The rings were assembled in a lamellar fashion similar to psammoma bodies or a parasite egg (commonly, kidney worm). With an amorphous material in the middle, the central core was surrounded by a two-layered wall that stained negative with PAS and von Kossa (for calcium). The annular structure was nonbirefringent when viewed under polarized-light microscopy, and on immunohistochemistry, the cystic lining tested positive for CD34 and CD31 .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Microscopic examination of the adrenal cavernous hemangioma showing cystic dilated vascular spaces filled with blood and lined with a single layer of mature endothelium, with adjacent compressed adrenal gland (hematoxylin-eosin staining ×40).</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Microscopic examination showing fibrinous matrix with many basophilic, lamellar structures (the rare: Liesegang ring) (hematoxylin-eosin staining ×100).</u>\n\n【15】The excision surgery was uneventful with no postoperative complications. The patient stayed in the hospital for three days postoperatively without any untoward incident. The six-month follow-up CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no signs of any distant metastasis or recurrence.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Due to the rarity of adrenal hemangioma, this benign form of a vascular tumor requires a definitive preoperative protocol for diagnosis since the tumor is nonfunctional and has no clinical manifestations of its own. The differential diagnoses for AH include benign adrenal, adenomas, myelolipomas, angiomyolipomas, or rare teratomas. Also, malignant adrenal neoplasms such as pheochromocytoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma may be considered while diagnosing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. AHs are mainly unilateral and more than 10 cm in diameter, predominantly affecting females in their fifth to a seventh decade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Biochemical tests, like the 24-hour catecholamine secretion in urine, are essential to rule out any endocrine neoplasms, especially pheochromocytoma. All laboratory test results of the patient reported in this study were unremarkable.\n\n【18】Based on the provisional diagnosis of a malignant adrenal cortical carcinoma, surgical resection of the tumor was done as per the mandatory protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. As reported above, the microscopic examination of the specimen revealed typical blood-filled dilated spaces of vascular origin with a monolayer endothelium. AH is usually a cavernous type (big vessels with wide blood-filled spaces within) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and rarely capillary in type (small well-defined tightly packed capillaries). Also, the presence of the endothelial markers CD34 (a marker of hematopoietic progenitor cells) and CD31 (a marker that stains small and large vessels in the cystic lining) confirms the vascular origin of tumors. These findings also corroborate the proposed congenital nature of AH, i.e. the influence of hereditary factors leading to vascular ectasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Another interesting finding in our study was the evidence of rare microscopic Liesegang rings seen in the AH specimen. Liesegang rings are concentric acellular structures common in chemical reactions where precipitation occurs as a consequence of the accumulation of sub- and supersaturation of insoluble components of a colloidal matrix. Not commonly seen in vivo, these rings are indicative of continuous deposition of organic components in tissues that have undergone degeneration either due to inflammation, fibrosis, necrosis, or cystic degeneration, i.e. the pathogenesis of the Liesegang ring remains unclear. Hitherto, the reported cases of Liesegang rings reveal the commonest site to be in the renal tissue, while other clinical accounts have documented these rings in the paranasal sinuses, eyelid, conjunctivae, and intraperitoneum endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 8\\]</u>. Also, isolated cases of Liesegang rings have been published in association with mammary duct ectasia and breast cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Often varying in shape, the diameter of these rings ranges from 5 to 820 nm depending on the size and location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Morphologically, these structures bear a resemblance to psammoma bodies. Also, they typically test positive for PAS, highlighting the double-layered wall. However, the case presented in the current study tested negative for PAS, similar to another previously published case report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The nonbirefringent nature of these rings under polarized-light microscopy was also seen in our patient’s specimen.\n\n【21】Furthermore, the Liesegang rings seen in our study were accompanied by both necrotic and hemorrhagic changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 12–16\\]</u>. The reason for these changes within the hemangioma and the specific components of the Liesegang ring is yet to be determined. However, the immunohistochemical and histochemical staining for iron (Prussian blue), calcium (von Kossa), amyloid, mucopolysaccharide, keratin, glycogen, and hemangioma’s epithelial antigen is negative. Additionally, using special stains, radiographic imaging, and scanning-electron microscopy, it has been demonstrated that, at times, these rings contain iron, silicon, and sulfur. Also, Tuur et al. have reported the presence of Ca++ ions, organic polycations and polyanions, and other inorganic anions in these rings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Because of this chemical composition, these rings have often been misidentified for parasites’ ova, green growth, calcific deposits, corpora amylacea, psammoma bodies, and the spheroid kind of amyloid. Therefore, even though these rings are a rare finding, it is imperative to characteristically study them to avoid misidentification with parasital ova. The typical presentation of a lamellar structure with a double-layered wall, cross-striations flowing radially, may be used for precise diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13, 15, 17–19\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Besides, the characteristic presence of peripheral discontinuous nodular enhancement with a centripetal pattern on the contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is highly suggestive of AH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. Following diagnosis, the standardized treatment for an enlarging symptomatic adrenal tumor or suspected carcinoma is surgical resection, irrespective of its endocrine activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【23】This review aimed to identify and systematically present the typical clinical features of the cavernous adrenal hemangioma to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning. Approximately 73 cases of cavernous AH have been published from 1955 through 2020 which were reviewed in the present study . The average age at which the patients were diagnosed was 55 years (range: 19–84 years old), and the prevalence of female gender in these patients was approximately 1.7 times more than the male gender 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Generally unilateral with no side preference in most cases, only one case of bilateral involvement has been reported so far 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The usual size has been reported to be above 10 cm in diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> ranging up to 35 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Endocrinology examinations of the adrenal tumor were normal for 67 out of 73 cases. Of the six clinically functional adrenal hemangiomas identified, three cases were of hyperaldosteronism, while the other three had subclinical Cushing’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The mean diameter of all these reported cases of adrenal hemangiomas with documented specific tumor characteristics was 11 cm and weighed an average of 752 gm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of the adrenal cavernous hemangiomas reported between 1955 and 2020.</u>\n\n【25】Of the 73 cases reviewed, 42 (57.5%) were discovered incidentally with no clinical symptoms, while the other 31 (42.5%) had clinical manifestations, including abdominal symptoms of epigastric pain and heaviness (n = 10) and pain or discomfort in the flank (n = 8), and 3 patients presented with rupture of the adrenal mass leading to retroperitoneal hemorrhage and hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25–27\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Surgical mass excision was done in 69 cases, of which 16 patients (22.5%) had laparoscopic surgery. Of the two nonoperated patients, one patient died from an unrelated cause, while the other opted for monitoring and observation since the tumor size was small and no clinical manifestations were seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 24\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Lastly, mitotane, an established adrenolytic drug, was used in these patients that did not affect the viability of primary culture cells. However, cytotoxic drugs like doxorubicin decreased the viability of these cells. Furthermore, there is evidence that sunitinib, a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor, drastically reduced the viability of the primary culture cells, indicating that the drug and its analogs may be useful in medically treating adrenal hemangiomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【28】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】Adrenal hemangioma should be considered as an important differential diagnosis of adrenal neoplasms despite being a rare finding.

The first cases of infections caused by this microorganism, such as pneumonia, soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, and meningitis, date back more than 40 years and are almost entirely in newborns and immunosuppressed hosts. Optimal antibiotic therapy for A. faecalis has not been well established in the literature. We report a case of an immunocompetent patient in Colombia who had meningitis due to A. faecalis after a dental procedure. It is important to know about this microorganism that nowadays could be considered a potentially emerging pathogen in immunocompetent adults.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Alcaligenes faecalis (A. faecalis) is an aerobic, nonfermentative, catalase and oxidase-positive, nonencapsulated, Gram-negative rod 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is named for its ability to produce an alkaline reaction in certain media 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. A. faecalis is the most frequently isolated member of the Alcaligenaceae family in the laboratory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. It could be found in the oil, water, and hospital environment, in objects such as mechanical ventilators, hemodialysis systems, and intravenous solutions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Although it is considered a normal saprophytic inhabitant of the human intestinal tract, it has been reported to cause dysentery and gastrointestinal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u> and has been isolated in urine, blood, wounds, feces, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and respiratory secretions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【5】A. faecalis usually causes opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts. In fact, it has been associated with severe infections such as peritonitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>, the latter being described mainly in neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Systemic and severe infections in immunocompetent hosts with this microorganism are very rare; there are limited data available. Herein, we present the first described case of meningitis due to A. faecalis in an immunocompetent adult in Colombia with a favorable outcome.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Description\n\n【8】A 30-year-old female with no relevant pathological history came to the emergency department due to seven days of fever and headache, with an intensity of 8/10 on the visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, photophobia, and neck pain. Subsequently, this was accompanied by an acute confusional syndrome, with variations in her behavior having aggressiveness and prosopagnosia.\n\n【9】On physical examination, vital signs were normal: blood pressure: 107/58 mmHg, mean blood pressure: 71 mmHg, heart rate: 88 beats/minute, respiratory rate: 18 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation: 99%, temperature: 36.2°C, and glucometer: 110 mg/dl. She was in poor general condition, stuporous, with neck stiffness accompanied by a positive Kerning and Brudzinski sign, a positive jolt accentuation sign, and an 11/15 Glasgow coma scale (GCS). The presence of a periodontal abscess was striking. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【10】At anamnesis, patient referred a persistent orodental pain which required a dental procedure fifteen days ago; she denied imaging realization and commented received an antibiotic (amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 hours) for 3 days ordered by a dentist. Blood tests reported the following: leukocytes: 4.87 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>, neutrophils: 52.80%, lymphocytes: 41.7%, hemoglobin: 7.7gr/dL; hematocrit: 25.4%; platelets: 361 × 10<sup>3</sup>/uL, glycemia 70 mg/dL, and initial chest X-ray was normal. A brain computed tomography (CT) was performed, reporting no space-occupying lesions, ischemic, hemorrhagic, and/or tomographic signs of intracranial hypertension.\n\n【11】With the described findings, central nervous system (CNS) infection was suspected, and due to disturbance of consciousness of fluctuating course, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for monitorization. Empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 hours) and corticosteroids (dexamethasone 10 mg every 6 hours) was started. Blood and urine cultures were taken.\n\n【12】A lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF cytochemical reported the following: glucose in liquid 58 mg/dl, proteins in liquid 70.80 mg/dl, colorless, appearance: transparent, pH: 8, density: 1000, leukocytes: 8.24 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>, polymorphonuclear cells: 60%, and mononuclear cells: 40%. A nonreactive nontreponemal test (VDRL), negative-staining India ink, and negative CSF culture for M. tuberculosis were obtained. Also, blood and urine cultures were reported as negative without any bacterial growth.\n\n【13】CSF culture reported single isolation of multisensitive A. faecalis .\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Results of antibiogram culture of CSF.</u>\n\n【15】Considering the rareness of the microorganism isolated in an adult without obvious risks for this infection leads to concern that the single CSF culture isolate may have been a contaminant. Thus, the culture was repeated, yielding the same result, confirming the diagnosis of meningitis due to A. faecalis. The patient was assessed by infectious diseases, who recommended giving antibiotic management for 14 days.\n\n【16】Given favorable evolution, improvement in the state of consciousness, and GCS, she was transferred to the hospitalization ward to continue treatment for the next seven days. After completing antimicrobial coverage, the patient was discharged without sequelae or neurological repercussions.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】A. faecalis is an etiological agent infrequently cited in the literature as the cause of systemic infection in adults. It has been isolated in different clinical scenarios, and medical equipment and solutions have been found to be contaminated with this bacterium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5\\]</u>. This microorganism is recognized as an opportunistic pathogen responsible for serious infections in immunosuppressed hosts, newborns, and infants. Nevertheless, CNS infections are rare. In our case, it was not possible to demonstrate significant comorbidities or immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>, which makes this case relevant.\n\n【19】The published information is limited. The first reported literature dates back to case reports over 50 years old, primarily for pediatric patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>. Cases of hematogenous dissemination and meningitis derived from a case of dysentery in a 3-year-old infant, atypical presentations of septicemia and meningitis in newborns, and even hydrocephaly in a newborn are highlighted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>. We could not identify extensive cases of meningitis due to this causal agent in immunocompetent adults.\n\n【20】Additionally, the most extensive case series of infections due to A. faecalis reported in the literature included 191 cases, of which 45 were bacteremia, 36 were cystitis, 23 were skin and soft tissue infections, 23 were otitis media, and 16 were meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is worth to mention that we do not find evidence of Colombian cases in this retrospective analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, considering this case the first report in this regard.\n\n【21】Most isolations of A. faecalis, identified in blood or respiratory secretions, are related to contamination of hospital fluids or equipment, promoting colonization of the human host 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Despite that, when there are symptoms, it is important to rule out the route of infection and the associated organ compromised 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The mechanisms of inoculation of this bacterium are multiple. However, the symptomatic disease involves a complex interplay between the virulence factors of the pathogens and the host’s immune response. Weinstein and Wasserman describe a series of cases of A. faecalis infection, among which they report cases of meningitis after CNS procedures and trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Within this description, infections related to skull fracture, meningocele correction, or acute otitis media stand out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case, it is believed that the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of meningitis were the results of previous colonization of mucous membranes that, with the patient's dental procedure, favored the invasion of the bloodstream from the maxillary alveolar bone with subsequent hematogenous dissemination where the microorganism crossed the blood-brain barrier into the CSF.\n\n【23】It should be added that meningitis by A. faecalis and its clinical manifestations are not different from other CNS infections, a reason to why the patient presented with positive Kerning and Brudzinski sign, a positive jolt accentuation sign. In this case, we rule out other more frequent microorganisms that caused meningitis before the final diagnosis and discard that the microbiological isolation was due to contamination because the patient had symptoms and two CSF cultures with single isolation of A. faecalis.\n\n【24】The optimal antibiotic therapy for A. faecalis has not been well established in the literature and is often difficult to treat due to its increased resistance to several antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. The A. faecalis isolated in our case was multisensitive, which allowed the use of conventional antibiotics that cross the CNS to obtain a favorable response with no neurological sequelae.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【26】Our manuscript’s importance lies in the lack of scientific literature regarding cases of meningitis due to A. faecalis in immunocompetent adults and in the fact that it is the first case described in Colombia. In conclusion, meningitis due to A. faecalis is rare and usually occurs in newborns or infants. However, it has also been described in adults, our case being one of the few in the literature.

Although small-bowel bleeding was suspected, no bleeding source was identified by enhanced computed tomography (CT), video capsule endoscopy (VCE), and double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). Five years later, the patient had recurrent intermittent bloody stools with a significant decrease in hemoglobin levels. Although no active bleeding was observed on antegrade DBE, we detected a pulsatile submucosal uplift accompanied by a small red patch on the top of the uplift in the jejunum. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was suspected as the cause of small-bowel bleeding. Multiple-phase CT showed a number of small vascular ectasias during the arterial phase in the jejunum, and we confirmed the presence of multiple AVMs in the jejunum by selective angiography. To identify the location of the lesions and determine the minimal surgical margins, we performed intraoperative selective angiography with indocyanine green (ICG) injection. This technique allowed us to clearly observe the region and perform segmental small-bowel resection with minimal surgical margin.

Introduction\n\n【3】The source of bleeding in approximately 5% of all gastrointestinal bleeding cases is from the small bowel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Abnormal blood vessels of the small bowel cause 20% to 30% of cases of small-bowel bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are an important vascular cause of small-bowel bleeding. However, it is often difficult to diagnose and treat AVMs of the small-bowel. Furthermore, it is challenging to determine the optimal surgical margin of the lesions when there are multiple lesions.\n\n【4】Herein, we report a case of multiple AVMs of the small-bowel that were detected by double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and in which we determined the optimal surgical margins using intraoperative selective angiography with indocyanine green (ICG) injection.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 62-year-old Japanese female was referred to our hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding five years prior to the current presentation. Five years before, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy could not identify any abnormalities. As abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) with delayed phase imaging did not reveal a source of the bleeding, video capsule endoscopy (VCE) was carried out for small-bowel evaluation. Although blood clots were detected in the jejunum, no bleeding source was identified. Subsequently, antegrade DBE was performed for further investigation. However, no active bleeding was observed, and no bleeding sources were detected. Thereafter, she had recurrent bloody stools intermittently about once a year. Although small-bowel evaluations including VCE, enhanced CT, and DBE were performed repeatedly, the cause of small-bowel bleeding could not be identified. Her current presentation was marked by intermittent bloody stools and a fall in hemoglobin level to as low as 8.7 g/dl. VCE was immediately performed and showed blood clots localized to the proximal jejunum, which failed to show a source of bleeding. This was followed by antegrade DBE to evaluate the jejunum intensively. On DBE, a pulsatile submucosal uplift, which was accompanied by a small red patch on the top of the uplift without active bleeding, was revealed in the jejunum 30 cm on the anal side from the ligament of Treitz . As an AVM was suspected as the cause of small-bowel bleeding, two clips were placed in close proximity to the submucosal uplift to control the arterial inflow for temporary bleeding prevention, which resulted in disappearance of pulsation and a color change by deterioration of blood flow in the lesion . Multiple-phase CT revealed multiple small vascular ectasias during the arterial phase and their early draining veins adjacent to the clips that had been placed in the jejunum on DBE . As multiple AVMs were suspected, a selective angiography was employed to identify the location of the lesions. Multifocal niduses were detected adjacent to the clips in the jejunum supplied by the second jejunal arteries . To determine the minimal and optimal surgical margins, we performed intraoperative selective angiography with ICG injection. 2.5 mg/ml of ICG in a total volume of 0.2 ml was injected intraoperatively from the second jejunal artery via a selective angiographic microcatheter, which immediately stained a 30 cm segment of the jejunum . ICG fluorescence enabled us to easily and clearly recognize the region and perform a segmental small-bowel resection with the minimal surgical margins. Pathological examination confirmed the presence of AVMs with features of tortuous, dilated veins, and arteries in the submucosal layer .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Antegrade double-balloon enteroscopy.

Discussion\n\n【14】Of all the sources of gastrointestinal bleeding, only a small percentage (5%) is attributed to a source in the small-bowel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In the small bowel, 20 to 30% of bleeding cases are caused by abnormal blood vessels, including angioectasias, AVMs, hemangiomas, and Dieulafoy’s lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. Especially, AVMs are the most common cause of small-bowel bleeding in people over the age of 50 years.\n\n【15】It can be exceedingly difficult to localize and diagnose the small-bowel AVMs, particularly in cases of occult bleeding. For hemodynamically stable patients who are suspected of having small-bowel bleeding, after EGD and colonoscopy with normal results, VCE is recommended as the next diagnostic test, and device-assisted enteroscopy can be considered in patients with positive bleeding sources identified on VCE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In general, AVMs in the small bowel have been described as submucosal uplift accompanied by redness, vascular proliferation, and vascular ectasia. However, most of them are findings in intraoperative endoscopy, and there are a limited number of cases diagnosed by preoperative endoscopy in the absence of active bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. The present case is a valuable report of AVMs in the small bowel that could be diagnosed by preoperative DBE, and the pulsatile submucosal uplift accompanied by a small red patch on the top might be an important finding that indicates AVMs. On the other hand, it is difficult to identify all the lesions by endoscopy in cases where multiple AVMs exist in the small bowel. In our case, we suspected the presence of multiple lesions based on the results of dynamic enhanced CT and confirmed it by selective angiography. In the diagnosis of AVM, dynamic enhanced CT and subsequent selective angiography as necessary to be performed, considering the possibility that there are multiple lesions.\n\n【16】With respect to the treatment of small-bowel AVMs, partial small-bowel resection with a minimal surgical margin is required for retaining small-bowel functions. However, it is exceedingly challenging to identify the location of lesions and determine the optimal surgical margin, especially in cases where there are multiple AVMs in the small bowel. A technique combining selective angiography with intraoperative methylene blue injection to aid the localization of obscure sources of GI bleeding, including AVMs, has been described in a number of case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. Although no reports described complications of this methylene blue injection technique, doses of 500 mg or greater of methylene blue can cause nausea, abdominal and chest pain, altered mental status, and methemoglobinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 12\\]</u>. ICG is a nontoxic, near-infrared fluorophore, and its clinical applications have been recently proposed in various surgical settings.

This new technique allows us to clearly visualize the regions of AVMs and immediately determine the optimal resection margins. Intraoperative selective angiography with ICG injection, which we performed in this case, is very safe and useful for the surgery of AVMs.\n\n【17】The optimal diagnosis and treatment strategy for multiple AVMs of the small bowel have not been fully elucidated. It has been reported that 5–37% of patients who underwent resection of AVMs will rebleed and one of the causes is incomplete excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 14, 15\\]</u>.

At present, the treatments of ACLF include general supportive treatment, etiological treatment, prevention and treatment of complications, artificial liver treatment, and liver transplantation. Many studies suggest that stem cell therapy may become a new treatment for patients with ACLF. Our department has also tried the application of this treatment. Now, there are three cases of stem cell therapy for patients with ACLF by our department which will be briefly reported.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Liver failure is a severe liver damage caused by a variety of reasons, resulting in serious disorders or decompensation of its synthesis, detoxification, excretion, biotransformation, and other functions, which leads to a group of clinical syndromes including coagulation disorders, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and ascites. Liver failure is featured with rapid progression, a lot of complications, and high mortality. While acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is an acute liver decompensation that occurs within 4 weeks on the basis of chronic liver disease. Patients may experience a series of clinical syndromes such as jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and coagulopathy, and the mortality rate is more than 60% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. At present, the treatments of ACLF include general supportive treatment, etiological treatment, prevention and treatment of complications, artificial liver treatment, and liver transplantation. Based on the above situation, patients with ACLF face not only severe illness and rapid progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> but also unsatisfactory effect of existing treatments, leading to high mortality. In recent years, stem cell therapy is a new way to treat liver failure, and there are three cases of stem cell therapy for patients with ACLF by our department which will be briefly reported.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case 1\n\n【5】Male, 48 years old, with a history of chronic hepatitis B, had been treated with entecavir for antiviral therapy for two years, which has been stopped without doctors’ guidance for five months till now. Two weeks ago, the patient gradually suffered from fatigue, abdominal distension, yellow urine, and eye irritation and was diagnosed as liver dysfunction in the local hospital. For further diagnosis and treatment, the patient was admitted to our hospital on September 14, 2012. Liver function tests before hospitalization showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1007 U/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 864 U/L, total bilirubin (TBIL) 218.7 μmol/L, and direct bilirubin (DBIL) 171.7 μmol/L, while hepatitis B virus markers showed HBsAg+, HBeAg+, HBcAb+, and HBV-DNA 3.21 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/L. According to the patient’s conditions, he was given a variety of treatments, involving conventional liver protection, reducing enzyme activity, eliminating jaundice, and entecavir antiviral therapy. With the consent of the patient, he was treated with hepatic arterial infusion of the umbilical cord blood stem cells (UC-MSCs mononuclear cells 42.4 × 10<sup>9</sup>/ml, flow cytometry CD34+ and CD33+ stem cells 8.9 × 10<sup>6</sup>/ml with a total input volume of 40 ml). The relevant tests were performed regularly after the infusion, including ALT, ALB, TBIL, and PTA. The patient was discharged from our hospital with a better health condition on October 26, 2012, and went back to the local hospital for continual treatment. Currently, the follow-up status is good. The changes of the patient’s indicators during treatment are shown in Table 1.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 The changes of the patient’s indicators during treatment (Case 1).</u>\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Case 2\n\n【8】Male, 54 years old, had a history of daily drinking with the amount of 100–150 g per day for 30 years, been diagnosed as “alcoholic cirrhosis” in other hospital one year ago. The patient began to feel the abdominal distension, accompanied by fatigue, yellow urine, and jaundice, one month ago. On April 11, 2012, the patient started the treatment in our hospital. After admission, the tests revealed ALT 924.6 U/L, AST 817.3 U/L, TBIL 274.2 μmol/L, and DBIL 189.4 μmol/L. With the consent of the patient, he was treated with peripheral injection of the umbilical blood stem cells (UC-MSCs mononuclear cells 39.6 × 10<sup>9</sup>/ml, flow cytometry CD34+ and CD33+ stem cells 10.1 × 10<sup>6</sup>/ml with a total input volume of 40 ml). The relevant tests were performed regularly after the infusion, including ALT, ALB, TBIL, and PTA. At the same time, the patient was given supportive treatments such as stopping drinking, conventional liver protection, reducing transaminase, and eliminating jaundice as well as albumin treatment. The input of stem cells promotes the regeneration of liver cells and the recovery of various physiological functions. The changes of the patient’s indicators during treatment can be seen in Table 2. The patient was discharged with a better health condition on May 21, 2012, and regular follow-up was conducted after discharge.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 The changes of the patient’s indicators during treatment (Case 2).</u>\n\n【10】#### 4\\. Case 3\n\n【11】Male, 52 years old, had a history of hepatitis B for more than 10 years without regular treatments. The patient often drinks alcohol, and the average amount is around 250 g each time. The patient started to feel malaise and fatigue, abdominal distension on January 12, 2013, but the symptoms were largely ignored at that time. Five days ago, after drinking 250–300 g of alcohol, the patient suffered from significantly increased fatigue, together with poor appetite, yellow urine, and jaundice. The patient started the treatment in our hospital on January 19, 2013. Outpatient tests for liver function showed ALT 771 U/L, AST 608 U/L, TBIL 176.5 μmol/L, and DBIL 102.7 μmol/L, while hepatitis B virus markers showed HBsAg+, HBeAb+, HBcAb+, and HBV-DNA 1.86 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/L. After admission, the patient received a series of treatments, including entecavir antihepatitis B virus therapy, liver protection, eliminating jaundice and reducing enzyme activity treatment, immune regulation, and complication prevention. The review of liver function on January 28, 2013, indicated ALT 465 U/L, AST 504 U/L, and TBIL 239.5 μmol/L, showing the rapid progression of disease. With the consent of the patient, he was treated with peripheral injection of the umbilical blood stem cells (UC-MSCs mononuclear cells 37.4 × 10<sup>9</sup>/ml, flow cytometry CD34+ and CD33+ stem cells 8.9 × 10<sup>6</sup>/ml with a total input volume of 40 ml). The relevant tests were performed regularly after the infusion, including ALT, ALB, TBIL, and PTA. The reexamination for liver function on February 7, 2013, showed ALT 307 U/L, AST 446 U/L, and TBIL 265.3 μmol/L, which indicated that the disease progression was significantly advanced. On February 12, the review of liver function revealed ALT 265 U/L, AST 372 U/L, and TBIL 308.1 μmol/L. With the progression of the patient’s health condition, the follow-up treatment was conducted. The patient was given bilirubin adsorption treatment for 2 times, while the effect is still poor, and the family abandoned the treatment and discharged .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 The changes of the patient’s indicators during treatment (Case 3).</u>\n\n【13】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【14】In our country, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the main cause of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, the mortality of which is as high as 62.18%–72.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. Other causes of ACLF include alcohol, drugs and toxic substances, and genetic metabolism. The main treatments include comprehensive medical treatment, artificial liver treatment, and liver transplantation. Comprehensive medical treatment covers supportive treatment, etiological treatment, prevention and treatment of complications, and the use of other medications, the curative effect of which is limited. Orthotopic liver transplantation serves as the only effective treatment, but its application is limited due to donor liver deficiency, rejection after transplantation, and adverse effects caused by the use of a great many immunosuppressants after transplantation. The artificial liver support system can not only remove all kinds of toxic substances stranded in the body caused by liver damage but also replenish some bioactive substances, so as to maintain the stability of the inner environment of the body, gain time for hepatocyte regeneration, and reduce the patients’ mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, studies by Li 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> (artificial liver) have shown that plasma exchange is more effective for the clinical treatment of early and intermediate stage liver failure, while its effect is relatively poor for advanced liver failure. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find a way to treat and prolong the survival time of ACLF patients.\n\n【15】Stem cell transplantation can provide a large number of hepatocyte-like cells, replacing the synthetic and metabolic function required by the normal liver, and change the tissue microenvironment through a paracrine mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore, many studies suggest that stem cell therapy may become a new treatment for patients with advanced liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, especially umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) have been a hot research topic in recent years. Studies from Li et al. indicate that, for patients with ACLF, UC-MSCs treatment is beneficial to the recovery of patients’ liver function and can effectively improve the survival rate of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【16】At present, there is no clear mechanism of stem cell to improve liver function and mainly the following two hypotheses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>: first, the differentiation of stem cells. Under the action of microenvironment, stem cells can differentiate into functional liver cells. Second, the role of stem cells in paracrine secretion, which can promote the multiplication capacity of endogenous hepatocytes. Based on the two hypotheses and a large number of previous clinical studies, the efficacy and safety of stem cells in the treatment of end-stage liver disease have been confirmed.\n\n【17】All three patients in this study had received an input of umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), but the etiology and the method of input are different: Case 1, patients for HBV-related ACLF, given the hepatic artery interventional infusion; Case 2, patients for alcohol-related ACLF, given peripheral venous infusion; and Case 3, patients for hepatitis B combined with alcohol-related ACLF, also given peripheral intravenous infusion. According to the treatment results of 3 patients, Case 2 patient with ACLF caused by alcohol alone had the best therapeutic effect, and the hepatic artery intervention infusion had the fastest effect and the best curative effect, but which need a large sample of clinical trials to confirm. And further clinical observation and analysis are needed for long-term prognosis and long-term safety after UC-MSCs transplantation.\n\n【18】The immune mechanism of liver failure is not yet clear, and it requires further study on the immune manifestations of different causes, different stages, and different patients. For patients with ACLF, no treatment is a panacea. The most appropriate treatment can only be achieved through targeting the right patient, choosing the right medicine, and seizing the right time. It is believed that, with the deepening of research on liver failure, the correct answer will be found in the complicated pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations, so that clinicians can make timely and correct judgment and treatment options for patients in order to obtain the maximum clinical benefit.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:58:03", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:58:48", "cost": 44.913}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:58:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:58:02"}

Introduction\n\n【3】The utilization of coronary stents has been the most important advancement in the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). A rare but potentially serious complication of stent usage is dislodgment of the stent from the balloon catheter before the deployment and subsequent dislocation of the stent into the vascular system.

Case Report\n\n【6】A 67-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital because of unstable angina.

The target lesion was predilated with a  mm Asahi Intecc balloon. Subsequent angiography revealed 20% stenosis at the lesion site . The decision was made to place a stent due to the existing plaque fracture and the improved long-term outcome results already achieved with stents. A  mm Ephesos stent was selected. Stent could not be advanced through the lesion. After several attempts the stent was pulled back into the guiding catheter. During the withdrawing process the stent had dislodged from the balloon catheter . A small balon (  mm Invatec Avion Plus) was advanced through the stent, inflated, and finally was withdrawn with the stent .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | After balloon dilatation. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Stent had dislodged from the balloon catheter. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Small balloon, stent, and catheter complex. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Stent dislodgment and migration is an uncommon problem. But as a result of the universal use of premounted stents invasive cardialogists may come across with it more often. Stent dislodgement from the delivery system most often occurs while the stent-balloon assembly is pulled back into the guiding catheter, because the target lesion either could not be reached or could not be passed. Factors predisposing to the inability of stent delivery are poor support of the guiding catheter or the guide wire, vessel tortuosity proximal to the lesion, and severe vessel calcification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In the event of stent dislodgment the primary objective should be the retrieval of dislodged stent from the coronary circulation due to the possibility of significant complications.

It is almost always acquired, with rare cases of congenital TTP (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome).

Here, we describe the 10th case of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) complicated by TTP and discuss the complexity of its management in a developing country.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 42-year-old Afro-Brazilian woman was admitted to emergency department with gradual neurologic disorientation, associated with severe headache and episodes of vomiting for three days. The patient had a past history of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) for 4 years. Her clinical presentation included Raynaud’s phenomenon associated with puffy fingers, arthralgias, mild arthritis (nonerosive and nondeforming), and myalgia. She also had a pericardial effusion 3 years ago that seems to be related to MCTD. Laboratory studies revealed that the patient had an ESR of 70 mm/hr, positive rheumatoid factor (titre >128), positive ANA (1 : 1280) with speckled pattern, and positive anti-U1-RNP (>240 U/mL). Anti-DNA, Anti-SM, Anti-CCP, Anti-Jo1, Anti-SS-A, Anti-SS-B, Anti-SCL-70, Anticentromere, ANCA, and Anticardiolipin were negative. She reported having used only prednisone for the treatment of MCTD, currently using 10mg/kg/day. She also had hypertension on regular treatment for the last 10 years.\n\n【6】On admission she was awake, dehydrated (+/4+), pale (2+/4+), confused, and disorientated with a Glasgow coma scale of 13 points and without focal neurologic deficit. The blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg, pulse 108 per min. and temperature 37.2°C. Clinical examinations of the cardiovascular, respiratory systems, and abdomen were normal. There was edema in the lower limbs (2+/4+). Complete blood cell count showed a normocytic normochromic anemia and thrombocytopenia . Peripheral blood smear demonstrated anisocytosis, poikilocytosis with schistocytes, and thrombocytopenia . Biochemical analysis revealed elevated levels of serum LDH (1,830 U/L) and bilirubin (total 4.1 mg/dL, direct 2.1 mg/dL and indirect 2.0 mg/dL). Direct Coombs test was negative, and PT and aPTT were normal. Her urine exam was positive to protein (3+), leukocyte (2+), hemoglobin, (4+), bilirubin (1+), and urobilinogen (2+) with negative nitrite. Other laboratory data are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory data.</u>\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Blood Smear with anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, polychromatophilia (polychromasia) with schistocytes, and thrombocytopenia (1000x). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】Clinical identification of nonimmune haemolytic anemia with presence of red cell fragmentation, thrombocytopenia, and altered level of consciousness led to the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura secondary to autoimmune disease, since the patient was previously diagnosed as MCTD. Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (80 mg/day) scheme was initiated after administration of antiparasitic therapy (prophylaxis of strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>), fresh frozen plasma (15 mL/kg/day), and red blood cells transfusion with blood pressure monitoring and use of diuretics to prevent fluid overload.\n\n【10】She evolved in 24 hours with high fever (39.2°C); blood pressure was 160/80 mmHg, and subsequently, with decreased level of consciousness, she underwent endotracheal intubation and was transferred to the Intensive care unit (ICU). The infusion of fresh frozen plasma was progressively increased to 25–30 mL/kg/day. During hospitalization, she presented with pneumonia and received ceftriaxone and clindamycin. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no specific abnormalities.\n\n【11】After 5 days in the ICU, she showed good clinical outcome, with improvement of neurologic and respiratory parameters, allowing weaning and withdraw of mechanical ventilation. Throughout the period her blood pressure was kept under strict control with captopril, amlodipine, atenolol, methyldopa, and losartan, as well as periods of sodium nitroprusside.\n\n【12】After 20 days of hospitalization, the patient presented progressive improvement in microangiopathic anemia, increased haemoglobin, and platelets, and a progressive decrease of LDH and reticulocytes . She was not submitted to plasmapheresis. There was normalization of blood pressure with concomitant gradual reduction in the volume of fresh frozen plasma infused and reduction of prednisone. She was discharged from the hospital with antihypertensive drugs (clonidine and amlodipine) and prednisone (20 mg/day). After 40 days of symptom onset and 20 days after discharge the patient was asymptomatic and laboratory tests improved .\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Following the discovery that TTP is associated with a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>, it was suggested that ADAMTS13 deficiency may become the definition and diagnostic criterion for TTP. But many patients who fulfill the clinical diagnostic criteria for TTP do not have ADAMTS13 deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 25\\]</u>. For some authors, measurements of ADAMTS13 activity are not required and do not conclusively confirm the diagnosis of TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. In this way, the diagnosis of TTP is based on the presenting clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Prompt diagnosis of TTP is critical to begin treatment and reduce patient’s mortality.\n\n【15】Patients diagnosed with TTP may have additional disorders including autoimmune diseases. In this group systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common, followed by antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, adult onset Still’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–12\\]</u>.\n\n【16】TTP associated with mixed connected tissue disease is rare and has only been described in nine patients  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–21\\]</u>. Most of these cases were women (8 : 1) with the median age of 40 years. The mortality was high (45%), early, (within 2–45 days) and associated with serious neurological impairment (seizure and coma). Our case presented a good clinical evolution in spite of serious neurological manifestations which points to a worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Characteristics of TTP in patients with MCTD.</u>\n\n【18】The pathogenic processes of thrombotic microangiopathy in patients with connective tissue diseases are heterogeneous. ADAMTS13 activity is significantly decreased in this group of patients. However, only a minor population presents neutralising autoantibodies against ADAMTS13, which was associated with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, lower platelet counts, and better therapeutic outcomes. A major population has normal or moderately reduced ADAMTS13 activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this group, the mechanisms of development of TTP remain unclear. There is a higher prevalence of anti-endothelial cell antibodies in the sera of MCTD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> and depressed plasma fibrinolytic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>, suggesting that a MCTD related vasculitis and thrombotic microangiopathy may have been involved in the pathogenesis of TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 17\\]</u>. In patients with systemic sclerosis, renal crisis remains one of the potential processes related to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, accelerated hypertension and acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 30\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Previous reported cases were treated with various therapies including steroids, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), plasma exchange (PE), prostacyclin, vincristine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab and aspirin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–21\\]</u>. Today, the mainstay of treatment of acute TTP is plasma exchange 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Before the plasma treatment era, survival of patients with TTP was only 10%. Then, almost 20 years ago, plasma exchange was reported to increase survival to 78%, compared to 51% survival for patients treated with plasma infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.

However, whereas atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori involves the antrum, the antrum is spared in autoimmune gastritis. Here, we report the use of magnifying endoscopy to identify and distinguish atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori from autoimmune gastritis. The mucosal pattern in autoimmune gastritis is that of closely arranged small round and oval pits, thus differing from the pattern seen in atrophic mucosa due to H. pylori infection. We speculate that this reflects differences in inflammation between the two types of gastritis. In autoimmune gastritis the inflammation is directed primarily against gastric glands, whereas in H. pylori infection the inflammation is directed against the bacteria on or near the surface and the damage initially affects the surface epithelium. During repair, the normal regular round pits are destroyed, whereas they remain largely intact in mucosa with autoimmune-associated atrophy. Confirmation of the features of autoimmune gastritis revealed by magnifying endoscopy would not only make the endoscopic diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis more accurate, but also help to elucidate changes in the surface epithelial structure of gastritis due to various causes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The two most common causes of atrophic gastritis are an autoimmune mechanism or persistent infection with Helicobacter pylori. Ultimately, persistent chronic inflammation may result in severe atrophy of the stomach’s mucosal lining. In autoimmune gastritis the antral mucosa is spared, and characteristically the atrophy is associated with a marked elevation of the serum gastrin level, which may result in type I gastric carcinoid tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In contrast, H. pylori infection affects the gastric antrum and tends to blunt the hypergastrinemic response to hypochlorhydria, gastric carcinoids being uncommon. Although both of these two forms of atrophic gastritis are common, there have been no reports of endoscopically evident features that can reliably distinguish between autoimmune and H. pylori induced atrophic gastritis.\n\n【4】Here we used magnifying endoscopy to identify differences between the two types of atrophic gastritis. The appearance of the gastric corpus in patients with autoimmune gastritis differs from that of atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, which exhibits either ridged surface structures or a villous to granular surface pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. In contrast, the magnified endoscopic appearance of the atrophic mucosa in autoimmune gastritis is similar, but not identical, to that of the corpus in the H. pylori\\-negative stomach. We report our findings obtained using magnifying endoscopy in three patients with autoimmune gastritis. We found that the atrophic mucosa of the corpus in all three patients exhibited a previously undescribed pattern of closely arranged small round and oval pits.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 48-year-old woman presented with epigastric discomfort. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed severe mucosal atrophy in the gastric corpus. Magnifying endoscopy of the corpus revealed closely arranged small round and oval pits with a surrounding network of capillaries. In the antrum, both conventional and magnifying endoscopy demonstrated no abnormal features, and the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having autoimmune gastritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Biopsy specimens were taken from both the antrum and the corpus. The histology of the antral mucosa was normal, whereas that of the corpus exhibited severe atrophy. The serum gastrin level was 4440 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL), and the level of antiparietal cell antibody was ×160 positive. The patient was negative for anti-intrinsic factor antibody and anti-H.  pylori antibody IgG, and the urea breast test gave a result of 2.2‰  (reference range: <2.5‰). The diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis was therefore confirmed.\n\n【8】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【9】A 72-year-old woman presented for a routine health check. Upper GI endoscopy identified severe atrophy of the mucosa in the gastric corpus , and magnifying endoscopy showed a pattern of closely spaced small round and oval pits . Conventional endoscopy of the antrum demonstrated no abnormality, suggesting a diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis. As this endoscopic examination was part of a routine health check, no biopsy was performed. However, serum samples revealed a gastrin level of 1800 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL) and antiparietal cell antibody ×40 positive, with negativity for anti-intrinsic factor antibody and anti-H. pylori antibody IgG. Autoimmune gastritis was therefore confirmed.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Conventional endoscopic finding in the corpus of Case 2. (b) Magnifying endoscopic findings in the corpus of Case 2 with narrow band imaging (NBI) (full zoom). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【12】A 58-year-old man had been found to have gastric nodules by X-ray and endoscopic examinations at another hospital. During the endoscopic examination, three nodules were biopsied and one was suspected to be a carcinoid tumor. The other two were diagnosed as atrophic gastric mucosa. A conventional endoscopic reexamination at our hospital revealed multiple nodules on the greater curvature of the corpus , one of which was reddish . Magnifying endoscopy showed that this reddish nodule had a gyriform-like structure with an irregular vascular pattern . Based on the magnifying endoscopy findings, the reddish nodule was diagnosed as a carcinoid tumor, and this was subsequently confirmed by histological examination of a biopsy sample. Conventional endoscopic examination of the corpus demonstrated severe atrophic gastritis . Magnifying endoscopic examination of the other nodules revealed closely arranged small round pits  and a pattern of closely arranged small round and oval pits was also observed in the mucosa surrounding these nodules . Thus, magnifying endoscopy was able to show that this characteristic pit pattern was present even in the atrophic mucosa of the corpus, leading to a diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis associated with a carcinoid tumor. Analysis of the patient’s serum showed a gastrin level of 2700 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL), antiparietal cell antibody ×80 positive, positivity for anti-intrinsic factor antibody, and negativity for anti-H. pylori antibody IgG. The reddish nodule and some of the surrounding nodules that showed closely arranged small round pits were treated by endoscopic mucosal dissection (ESD). The reddish nodule was 3 mm in diameter and histological examination confirmed that it was a carcinoid tumor. The other small nodules showed remnants of fundic glands within the atrophic mucosa .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | (a) Conventional endoscopic findings in Case 3.

Discussion\n\n【15】Strickland and Mackay described autoimmune gastritis as Type A atrophic gastritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. One characteristic of autoimmune gastritis is hypergastrinemia, which may lead to the development of gastric carcinoids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, the histological features of autoimmune gastritis are a normal pyloric glandular mucosa and severe atrophic changes in the corpus, thus differing from those of atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, which primarily affects the antrum. The endoscopic diagnosis is based on an apparently normal antral mucosa alongside severe atrophic mucosa in the corpus. However, it difficult to reliably diagnose autoimmune gastritis on the basis of this criterion alone. Histologically, normal pyloric gland mucosa is taken from antrum, although atrophic mucosa is taken from the corpus in biopsy specimens. However, in a real clinical condition, a diagnosis is only rarely decided from biopsy specimens, and instead, is based on the results of serological examinations for gastrin, antiparietal cell antibody and anti-intrinsic factor antibody. A much more practical approach would be to diagnose autoimmune gastritis by imaging of the morphological features, that is, by using magnifying endoscopy, before serological confirmation.\n\n【16】We have previously described the characteristic features of the corpus in H. pylori infection revealed by magnifying endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u> and classified such H. pylori induced gastritis into four types (the so-called “Z classification”) which excludes an atrophic mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. However, in order to include cases showing an atrophic mucosa, the classification was subsequently modified and renamed the A-B classification system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. The normal mucosa of the corpus without H. pylori infection, as demonstrated by magnifying endoscopy, shows a pattern of regular round pits surrounded by a network of capillaries that coalesce into collecting venules; this is classified as type B-0 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Mild gastritis due to H. pylori shows round pits surrounded by a slightly irregular network of capillaries, and this is classified as type B-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Active gastritis showing round pits with dividing sulci is classified as type B-2, and active gastritis with dilated pits and denser sulci is classified as type B-3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Atrophic mucosa with ridge surface structures is classified as type A-1 and that with villous to granular surface structures as type A-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Magnifying endoscopy shows that atrophic mucosa has an appearance different from that of nonatrophic mucosa. In case 1, closely arranged small round and oval pits were seen in the atrophic mucosa and, based on the above classifications, we considered that the patient had autoimmune gastritis. From this experience, we were able to diagnose cases 2 and 3 as autoimmune gastritis based on these magnifying endoscopic features, which differ from those of the atrophic mucosa in H. pylori infection and are similar but not identical to those of the corpus in the absence of H. pylori (type B-0).\n\n【18】We think that this feature of autoimmune gastritis revealed by magnifying endoscopy is very practical for diagnostic confirmation before ordering serological examination.\n\n【19】Additional cases of autoimmune gastritis studied by magnifying endoscopy are needed to confirm that the pattern described above is truly a unique feature of the corpus in this disease. It is interesting to note that the magnified view of the atrophic mucosa in the corpus of patients with autoimmune gastritis differs from that seen in H. pylori induced mucosal atrophy. We speculate that this may be related to the differences in the pattern and type of inflammation between the two types of gastritis. In autoimmune gastritis, the inflammation is largely mononuclear and directed primarily against gastric glands, whereas in H. pylori infection the inflammation shows an acute on chronic pattern and is directed against the bacteria located on the surface. In H. pylori gastritis, the mucosal damage is largely a bystander effect, and most severe at the surface epithelium. Ongoing inflammation likely influences mucosal repair and does not allow reconstruction of the normal surface epithelium (i.e. the regular round pits are destroyed). In contrast, in autoimmune gastritis, the normal surface structure may remain intact or be subjected to less damage, remaining recognizable in the atrophic mucosa as a pattern of closely arranged round and oval pits.\n\n【20】The changes of surface epithelial structure in various types of gastritis are thought to differ according to cause, and the features revealed by magnifying endoscopy may provide clues for elucidating such changes in surface epithelial structure.\n\n【21】Furthermore, a gyriform-like structure surrounded by closely arranged small round pits in the atrophic mucosa, as seen in Case 3, may be a specific magnifying endoscopic feature of carcinoid arising from autoimmune gastritis. Further accumulation of cases of autoimmune gastritis, observed by magnifying endoscopy, will be necessary.\n\n【22】In conclusion, magnifying endoscopy has shown that, in autoimmune gastritis, the atrophic mucosa in the corpus has a characteristic pattern of closely arranged small and oval pits, thus differing markedly from the appearance of atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection. Magnifying endoscopic observation is thus very useful for diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis. Confirmation of the magnifying endoscopic features of autoimmune gastritis would not only make the endoscopic diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis more accurate but also help to clarify the changes in surface epithelial structure characteristic of gastritis due to various causes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:52:00", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:52:56", "cost": 55.413}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:52:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:51:59"}

However, ED in young adults is rarely reported. We presented a case of typical ED occurring in a young healthy man following an uneventful appendectomy. The causes of ED can be classified as either predisposing or precipitating factors. In this case, the unnoticeable mental stress may be the predisposing factor and the sevoflurane maintenance of anesthesia may be the precipitating factor.

Emergence delirium (ED) is defined as the delirium that occurs during the transition from the sleep state to full consciousness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

ED increases the risk for injury, self-extubation, hemorrhages, and prolonged hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The European Society of Anesthesiology evidence-based and consensus-based guideline on POD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> states that the risk factors for POD include advanced age, combination of other systemic diseases (e.g. cerebrovascular including stroke, Parkinson’s disease, depression, and anxiety disorders), alcohol-related disorders, preoperative fluid fasting and dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, drugs with anticholinergic effects, operation site, intraoperative bleeding, operation time, and postoperative pain. Factors contributing to pediatric ED are as follows: preschool age, psychological immaturity, preoperative anxiety, surgical categories (e.g. ear, nose, and throat surgery), inhalational maintenance of anesthesia, pain, and physiological condition (e.g. hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, ED in young adults is poorly investigated. We presented a case of typical ED occurring in a young healthy man following an uneventful appendectomy and discussed the potential mechanisms.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 29-year-old man, 60 kg, body mass index 21.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, was presented for an emergency appendectomy. The acute right lower quadrant pain occurred a day before. The peripheral blood leukocyte counts (13.23 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and abdominal ultrasound examination indicated acute appendicitis, and other examinations were normal. He had a normal mental state, fair sleep and appetite, normal urination and defecation, and no change in body weight within half a year. He and his relatives had no history of drug abuse, alcohol or nicotine abuse, specific medication intake regularly, metabolic diseases, allergic reactions, treatment with psychiatric drugs, epilepsy, or neurological disorder.\n\n【6】No premedications were given. Upon arrival in the operating room, midazolam 2 mg and dexamethasone 10 mg were administered intravenously. Anesthesia was induced by intravenous injection of propofol 100 mg, sufentanil 20 μg, and rocuronium 35 mg and maintained by sevoflurane inhalation and continuous infusion of remifentanil. A size #4 laryngeal mask airway was inserted for ventilation. The surgery took 2 hours to complete and was uneventful with no significant blood loss. No adverse events, such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia, occurred during the procedure. A patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) with sufentanil 100 μg, dexmedetomidine 100 μg, and butorphanol 5 mg was used for postoperative analgesia. To accelerate emergence, a flow rate of 8 L/min with 60% O<sub>2</sub> was used to “wash out” sevoflurane after turning off the anesthesia vaporizer. About 5 min later, spontaneous breathing recovered, but his eyes were closed and he did not respond to anesthesiologist’s commands. Neostigmine 2 mg and atropine 1 mg were intravenous injected to antagonize residual rocuronium, and flumazenil 0.3 mg was injected to reverse midazolam. After 5-minute assessment of the ventilation volume and rate and capnography, the patient was extubated but was still unresponsive, and he tightly closed his eyes and began to sob with no tears and shake his head continuously (Supplementary video 1). He looked very sad. This condition lasted approximately 2 to 3 minutes, followed by somnolence with eyes closed and continuous opening and closing of his jaw that lasted approximately 3 to 5 minutes (Supplementary video 2). These two situations were repeated continuously. Vital signs were stable, and oxygen saturation remained at 97% to 100% during this period. The patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit. His wife was invited to comfort the patient, but he was still unresponsive and had no alleviation of the symptoms. This patient completely self-recovered within 5 hours without drug intervention. After recovery, the patient could not recall what happened in the past several hours. However, he felt a voice was calling him and he could not wake up. Moreover, he denied having experienced any pain associated with the surgical procedure. After a detailed history review, the patient had a little worry about his occupation mobility in the past year, but that did not meet the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder according to the 5th Edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, his mental status based on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was 24, which belongs to mild anxiety disorder. Additionally, no mental disorder and cognition impairment occurred in this patient during the 6-month follow-up.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【8】The causes of POD can be classified as either predisposing or precipitating factors. It is often difficult to pinpoint a specific cause, and most of the time, it is the sum of predisposing and precipitating factors. Thus, we screened preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors for pediatric ED and POD to discuss the potential predisposing and precipitating factors for this patient.\n\n【9】##### 3.1. Preoperative Risk Factors\n\n【10】Although preschool age and advanced age are recognized as risk factors for pediatric ED and POD, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, ED did occur in young adults as reported in this case and other previous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>, indicating that ED can occur at any age.\n\n【11】Many patients may suffer different degrees of anxiety, tension, and other adverse emotions from surgery, life, and work 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. These abnormalities can result in continuous mental stress, which affects their sleep quality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and the central nervous system, and are risk factors for POD. According to the analysis of the published ED case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>, most of the young patients had mental state abnormalities after medical history review. In our case, the patient had a mild anxiety disorder based on BAI, which may be the predisposing factor for this ED.\n\n【12】##### 3.2. Intraoperative Risk Factors\n\n【13】Surgical type, duration, emergency surgery, blood loss, and transfusion are risk factors for POD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Surgery duration greater than 3 hours in cardiac surgery or 6 hours in head and neck cancer resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> is an independent predictor of POD. In this case, the appendectomy was a small surgery with no obvious blood loss and was completed in 2 hours. Moreover, the case of POD or ED after appendectomy had never been reported in the literature.\n\n【14】Nearly most of the anesthetic drugs have been reported to be the risk factors of POD. Midazolam was implicated in a 26-month-old child who developed delirium following 0.5 mg/kg of an oral dose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Corticosteroids have been reported to be a probable cause of delirium in a dose-dependent manner or under continuous use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. Our patient received a small dose of midazolam and dexamethasone. Thus, they are unlikely to contribute to this ED. The effect of opioids is unclear, but studies found remifentanil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> and sufentanil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> could reduce the incidence of ED. As far as we know, no studies found that rocuronium is associated with POD. Thus, remifentanil, sufentanil, and rocuronium are unlikely to be risk factors for ED in this case.\n\n【15】Propofol and volatile anesthetics are commonly used anesthetic agents. Propofol had been implicated in delirium, hallucinations, and amorous behavior in the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A case reported a 20-year-old female patient who had ED after propofol anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, recent findings suggest that low-dose propofol sedation reduces the risk of delirium in the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Moreover, this patient received only 100 mg propofol for induction. Considering the short time of elimination and the small dose, propofol is an unlikely culprit.\n\n【16】Inhalational maintenance of anesthesia is a high-risk factor for pediatric ED, but in adults, it has not been frequently reported. The incidence of ED in adults following sevoflurane anesthesia reached 11.8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Compared with total intravenous anesthesia, inhalational anesthesia is associated with a higher rate of ED in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 20\\]</u>. Thus, sevoflurane maintenance is likely to be the precipitating factor for this patient.\n\n【17】##### 3.3. Postoperative Risk Factors\n\n【18】Length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and postoperative pain were recommended as postoperative risk factors for POD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Clearly, the length of ICU stay is not the cause of ED. In this case, a PCIA was used after surgery and the patient reported no pain during the perioperative period, indicating that postoperative pain is unlikely to be the cause of ED.\n\n【19】Taken together, in this case, the likely predisposing factor for ED is his worry about occupation mobility and the precipitating factor is inhalational maintenance with sevoflurane. However, what are the potential mechanisms of the ED occurrence caused by mental stress and inhalational maintenance with sevoflurance? The most accepted theory holds that delirium is a neuropsychiatric manifestation caused by disturbances in brain metabolism and neurotransmitters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Constant stress or anxiety may lead to hypersensitivity of neural communication. The higher incidence of ED after inhalational anesthesia than total intravenous anesthesia may be primarily related to the low blood solubility and “fast in and fast out” nature of inhalational agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 22, 23\\]</u>. Therefore, it is possible to cause nonsynchronous neural excitation and abnormal neural communication; as a result, ED occurs. Although no difference of recovery time between the inhalational anesthesia and total intravenous anesthesia was found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>, which seems inconsistent with our hypothesis, we cannot ignore that the “fast out” of inhalational agents is usually achieved by manually increasing the air flow as done in this case (8 L/min), while the intravenous anesthetics are automatically eliminated. To demonstrate this hypothesis, a study comparing high “wash-out” with low “wash-out” flow rate after sevoflurane anesthesia will be carried out in our hospital.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】ED occurs at any age of patient and in any minor surgery.

After 5-minute assessment of the ventilation volume and rate and capnography, the patient was extubated but was still unresponsive, and he tightly closed his eyes and began to sob with no tears and shake his head continuously (Supplementary video 1). He looked very sad. This condition lasted approximately 2 to 3 minutes, followed by somnolence with eyes closed and continuous opening and closing of his jaw that lasted approximately 3 to 5 minutes (Supplementary video 2). These two situations were repeated continuously. Vital signs were stable, and oxygen saturation remained at 97% to 100% during this period. The patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit. His wife was invited to comfort the patient, but he was still unresponsive and had no alleviation of the symptoms. This patient completely self-recovered within 5 hours without drug intervention. After recovery, the patient could not recall what happened in the past several hours. However, he felt a voice was calling him and he could not wake up. Moreover, he denied having experienced any pain associated with the surgical procedure. After a detailed history review, the patient had a little worry about his occupation mobility in the past year, but that did not meet the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder according to the 5th Edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, his mental status based on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was 24, which belongs to mild anxiety disorder. Additionally, no mental disorder and cognition impairment occurred in this patient during the 6-month follow-up.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【8】The causes of POD can be classified as either predisposing or precipitating factors. It is often difficult to pinpoint a specific cause, and most of the time, it is the sum of predisposing and precipitating factors. Thus, we screened preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors for pediatric ED and POD to discuss the potential predisposing and precipitating factors for this patient.\n\n【9】##### 3.1. Preoperative Risk Factors\n\n【10】Although preschool age and advanced age are recognized as risk factors for pediatric ED and POD, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, ED did occur in young adults as reported in this case and other previous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>, indicating that ED can occur at any age.\n\n【11】Many patients may suffer different degrees of anxiety, tension, and other adverse emotions from surgery, life, and work 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. These abnormalities can result in continuous mental stress, which affects their sleep quality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and the central nervous system, and are risk factors for POD. According to the analysis of the published ED case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>, most of the young patients had mental state abnormalities after medical history review. In our case, the patient had a mild anxiety disorder based on BAI, which may be the predisposing factor for this ED.\n\n【12】##### 3.2. Intraoperative Risk Factors\n\n【13】Surgical type, duration, emergency surgery, blood loss, and transfusion are risk factors for POD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Surgery duration greater than 3 hours in cardiac surgery or 6 hours in head and neck cancer resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> is an independent predictor of POD. In this case, the appendectomy was a small surgery with no obvious blood loss and was completed in 2 hours. Moreover, the case of POD or ED after appendectomy had never been reported in the literature.\n\n【14】Nearly most of the anesthetic drugs have been reported to be the risk factors of POD. Midazolam was implicated in a 26-month-old child who developed delirium following 0.5 mg/kg of an oral dose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Corticosteroids have been reported to be a probable cause of delirium in a dose-dependent manner or under continuous use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. Our patient received a small dose of midazolam and dexamethasone. Thus, they are unlikely to contribute to this ED. The effect of opioids is unclear, but studies found remifentanil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> and sufentanil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> could reduce the incidence of ED. As far as we know, no studies found that rocuronium is associated with POD. Thus, remifentanil, sufentanil, and rocuronium are unlikely to be risk factors for ED in this case.\n\n【15】Propofol and volatile anesthetics are commonly used anesthetic agents. Propofol had been implicated in delirium, hallucinations, and amorous behavior in the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A case reported a 20-year-old female patient who had ED after propofol anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, recent findings suggest that low-dose propofol sedation reduces the risk of delirium in the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Moreover, this patient received only 100 mg propofol for induction. Considering the short time of elimination and the small dose, propofol is an unlikely culprit.\n\n【16】Inhalational maintenance of anesthesia is a high-risk factor for pediatric ED, but in adults, it has not been frequently reported. The incidence of ED in adults following sevoflurane anesthesia reached 11.8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Compared with total intravenous anesthesia, inhalational anesthesia is associated with a higher rate of ED in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 20\\]</u>. Thus, sevoflurane maintenance is likely to be the precipitating factor for this patient.\n\n【17】##### 3.3. Postoperative Risk Factors\n\n【18】Length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and postoperative pain were recommended as postoperative risk factors for POD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Clearly, the length of ICU stay is not the cause of ED. In this case, a PCIA was used after surgery and the patient reported no pain during the perioperative period, indicating that postoperative pain is unlikely to be the cause of ED.\n\n【19】Taken together, in this case, the likely predisposing factor for ED is his worry about occupation mobility and the precipitating factor is inhalational maintenance with sevoflurane. However, what are the potential mechanisms of the ED occurrence caused by mental stress and inhalational maintenance with sevoflurance? The most accepted theory holds that delirium is a neuropsychiatric manifestation caused by disturbances in brain metabolism and neurotransmitters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Constant stress or anxiety may lead to hypersensitivity of neural communication. The higher incidence of ED after inhalational anesthesia than total intravenous anesthesia may be primarily related to the low blood solubility and “fast in and fast out” nature of inhalational agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 22, 23\\]</u>. Therefore, it is possible to cause nonsynchronous neural excitation and abnormal neural communication; as a result, ED occurs. Although no difference of recovery time between the inhalational anesthesia and total intravenous anesthesia was found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>, which seems inconsistent with our hypothesis, we cannot ignore that the “fast out” of inhalational agents is usually achieved by manually increasing the air flow as done in this case (8 L/min), while the intravenous anesthetics are automatically eliminated. To demonstrate this hypothesis, a study comparing high “wash-out” with low “wash-out” flow rate after sevoflurane anesthesia will be carried out in our hospital.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】ED occurs at any age of patient and in any minor surgery.

Emergence delirium (ED) is defined as the delirium that occurs during the transition from the sleep state to full consciousness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. ED is an adverse postoperative complication that occurs in patients of any age but most often in children with a variable incidence of 10–80% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and elderly patients between 10% and 15% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. ED increases the risk for injury, self-extubation, hemorrhages, and prolonged hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The European Society of Anesthesiology evidence-based and consensus-based guideline on POD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> states that the risk factors for POD include advanced age, combination of other systemic diseases (e.g. cerebrovascular including stroke, Parkinson’s disease, depression, and anxiety disorders), alcohol-related disorders, preoperative fluid fasting and dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, drugs with anticholinergic effects, operation site, intraoperative bleeding, operation time, and postoperative pain. Factors contributing to pediatric ED are as follows: preschool age, psychological immaturity, preoperative anxiety, surgical categories (e.g. ear, nose, and throat surgery), inhalational maintenance of anesthesia, pain, and physiological condition (e.g. hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, ED in young adults is poorly investigated. We presented a case of typical ED occurring in a young healthy man following an uneventful appendectomy and discussed the potential mechanisms.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 29-year-old man, 60 kg, body mass index 21.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, was presented for an emergency appendectomy. The acute right lower quadrant pain occurred a day before. The peripheral blood leukocyte counts (13.23 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and abdominal ultrasound examination indicated acute appendicitis, and other examinations were normal. He had a normal mental state, fair sleep and appetite, normal urination and defecation, and no change in body weight within half a year. He and his relatives had no history of drug abuse, alcohol or nicotine abuse, specific medication intake regularly, metabolic diseases, allergic reactions, treatment with psychiatric drugs, epilepsy, or neurological disorder.\n\n【6】No premedications were given. Upon arrival in the operating room, midazolam 2 mg and dexamethasone 10 mg were administered intravenously. Anesthesia was induced by intravenous injection of propofol 100 mg, sufentanil 20 μg, and rocuronium 35 mg and maintained by sevoflurane inhalation and continuous infusion of remifentanil. A size #4 laryngeal mask airway was inserted for ventilation. The surgery took 2 hours to complete and was uneventful with no significant blood loss. No adverse events, such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia, occurred during the procedure. A patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) with sufentanil 100 μg, dexmedetomidine 100 μg, and butorphanol 5 mg was used for postoperative analgesia. To accelerate emergence, a flow rate of 8 L/min with 60% O<sub>2</sub> was used to “wash out” sevoflurane after turning off the anesthesia vaporizer. About 5 min later, spontaneous breathing recovered, but his eyes were closed and he did not respond to anesthesiologist’s commands. Neostigmine 2 mg and atropine 1 mg were intravenous injected to antagonize residual rocuronium, and flumazenil 0.3 mg was injected to reverse midazolam. After 5-minute assessment of the ventilation volume and rate and capnography, the patient was extubated but was still unresponsive, and he tightly closed his eyes and began to sob with no tears and shake his head continuously <mark>(Supplementary video 1).</mark> He looked very sad.

We performed ultrasonography (US), which demonstrated a congenital extrahepatic portal vein aneurysm. She had no obvious symptoms of the extrahepatic portal vein aneurysm. She had undergone gastrectomy without blood transfusion for gastric ulcer more than 20 years ago. Physical examination revealed no abnormal findings. US revealed a 2 . 2 × 1 . 8  cm, round shaped hypoechogenic lesion at the hepatic hilum. Color Doppler US showed bidirectional colors due to circular flow within this lesion. 3D-CT and CT angiography demonstrated that the saccular aneurysm at the hepatic hilum was 3.0 cm in diameter and was enhanced equal to that of portal vein.Twenty-six months after the diagnosis, the aneurysm had not grown in size. Since our patient had no serious complaints or liver disease, surgical procedures had not been employed.

She had undergone gastrectomy due to gastric ulcer without blood transfusion. Her family history was not particularly interesting. Physical examination revealed no jaundice, no abdominal mass, and no vascular noise. Routine blood tests did not show any remarkable findings.

However, recently, the number of reported cases has gradually increased with advances in imaging techniques. Koc et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported 25 PVA cases in 4186 patients using abdominal CT and US. PVAs are classified as intrahepatic and extrahepatic. Our case was diagnosed as extrahepatic PVA. Sixty-seven cases of extrahepatic PVAs were reported in the English literature from 1956 to 2008 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–44\\]</u>. Including our case, we summarized 68 PVA cases . Twenty-three males, 44 females, and one unknown were reported. Their mean age was 51.4 years (range 0–83 years), and the mean size was 43.6 mm (range 8–115 mm). The cyst-form was found in 36 cases and the fusiform was found in 22 cases (unknown 11 cases). Half of all cases complained of abdominal or back pain. Nineteen cases had no symptoms. Twenty-one patients showed liver dysfunction in blood examination, and only 23 had portal hypertension. Half of all cases had no past history. Nineteen patients had undergone operation, 2 had undergone embolization by angiography, and 46 were observed clinically. Fifty-eight cases had a good course, while 7 were dead. Previously, most patients with asymptomatic PVAs were managed by observation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Recently, several reports have suggested that operation can be performed easily and safely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 44\\]</u>.

Plain X-ray and CT scan  showed a multilobulated expansile osteolytic lesion in the left cuboid and lateral cuneiform bones. It crossed the tarsal and tarsal-metatarsal joints with early extension to the base of the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> metatarsal, totally measuring 3.0 × 3.5 × 3.5 cm. Cortical scalloping and erosions were seen in these bones as well as focal sclerotic border. MRI demonstrated PD-intermediate and T2-hyperintense signal in the lesion matrix .

The epithelioid cells have central to eccentric open nuclei with distinct nucleoli. There was no significant nuclear pleomorphism or frank malignancy. A prominent chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate including lymphocytes, foamy macrophages, and histiocytes was noted in the background. No multinucleated giant cells were seen. Initial immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed most cells in the lesion were positive for endothelial markers and histiocytic markers. Differential diagnosis of epithelioid haemangioendothelioma was excluded by the negative IHC for CAMTA1 and TFE3. Further IHC demonstrated numerous CD1a  and Langerin-positive Langerhans cells, while H3.3G34 W and H3K36 M for giant cell tumour of bone and chondroblastoma, respectively, were negative. Thinking along the line of a primary bone tumour, diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis was suggested, but with reservation due to the paucity of eosinophils and the prominent fibromyxoid stroma. Complete curettage of the lesion and cementation was then performed. The curettage specimen showed fragments of fibronodular tumour tissue with patchy necrosis and well-defined borders. There were cords and clusters of pinkish epithelioid cells similar to those seen in the needle biopsy . Most of these cells were CD1a- and Langerin-positive on IHC . In addition, there were prominent pseudoalveolar spaces, focal chondroid metaplasia, aggregates of multinucleated giant cells, and scattered Desmin-positive dendritic cells. These features were compatible with a diffuse-type tenosynovial giant cell tumour (DTSGCT), being supported by IHC for Clusterin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> which stained a minor population of the epithelioid cells  and cells lining the pseudoalveoli. This diagnosis was further confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrating colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) translocation in scattered cells using a break-apart probe .

Discussion\n\n【10】DTSGCT of soft tissue, whether intraarticular or extraarticular, is often symptomatic and prone to local recurrence if incompletely excised. DTSGCT involving bones of the foot rarely occurs, and some cases have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The present tumour most likely originated from the tarsal synovial joint with secondary bulky involvement of the adjacent tarsal and metatarsal bones. Besides the major intraosseous location, needle biopsy interpretation was compounded by the numerous reactive Langerhans cells, raising the suspicion of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. However, the paucity of eosinophils and the prominent fibromyxoid stroma were features unusual for this diagnosis. The long clinical history offered by the patient, plus focal sclerotic border on plain-X-ray and lack of frank malignancy by microscopy, pointed to a locally aggressive slow-growing tumour. This warranted complete curettage as the surgical treatment of choice. The pathological features of the curettage specimen were classical of diffuse-type tenosynovial giant cell tumour. This diagnosis was supported by IHC for Clusterin confirming the presence of synovial cells and FISH confirming the translocation of CSF1 in tumour cells. AS DTSGCT is prone to local recurrence, follow-up monitoring of this patient was also advised.\n\n【11】On retrospect, the prominent Langerhans cell proliferation could be explained by CSF1 translocation in tumour cells and their subsequent overexpression of CSF1 protein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The latter attracted the migration and proliferation of Langerhans cells together with other dendritic cells which possessed the cell surface protein CSF1R 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This contributed to the “landscaping effect” by macrophages and various dendritic cells so commonly seen in tenosynovial giant cell tumours.\n\n【12】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【13】We would like to raise awareness for the possible major bone involvement by DTSGCT mimicking a primary bone tumour and the exuberant reactive Langerhans cell proliferation mimicking Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Our case is unique with these two features occurring together, thus making diagnosis on the needle biopsy difficult. Although the underlying biomolecular mechanism is now known, the masquerading effect of Langerhans cells in DTSGCT has not been highlighted before in the medical literature and therefore is worth emphasizing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:42", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:52", "cost": 10.27}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:41"}

Pulmonary hypertension secondary to scurvy is a rare manifestation that historically has not been well studied and is only described in a handful of case reports. Case. Our case is about a 35-year-old female with a history significant for drug and tobacco abuse, obesity, poor diet, anxiety, and major depressive disorder who was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension in the setting of vitamin C deficiency (<0.01 mg/L). Conclusion. We present a case that shows pulmonary hypertension can be associated with scurvy and reversed rapidly with adequate vitamin C supplementation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In the United States and other developed countries, it is often assumed the incidence of vitamin C deficiency or scurvy is negligible due to widespread accessibility to fortified foods and vitamins. However, individuals who live alone and have a history of substance abuse, restrictive diet, or mental illness are much more likely to develop scurvy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Common early manifestations of scurvy include anemia, bone pain, easy bruisability, petechiae, gum disease, perifollicular hemorrhages on lower extremities, and mood alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A rare manifestation is pulmonary hypertension. A literature review from January 2020 found 10 cases written about pulmonary hypertension due to vitamin C deficiency. In all these cases, there was rapid resolution of the patient’s pulmonary hypertension after supplementation with vitamin C 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, there are not any current guidelines or long-term follow-ups (maximum 1 year) to treatments documented. It is thought that vitamin C deficiency leads to pulmonary hypertension secondary to decreased degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and decreased activity of nitrous oxide synthase (NOS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Our case is about a 35-year-old female who was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension in the setting of scurvy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】Our patient was a 35-year-old female with a past medical history significant for obesity, substance abuse, tobacco abuse (22-pack-year history), major depressive disorder, anxiety, and poor diet (primarily cheese steaks, chicken, and pork chops) who was admitted to our hospital with painful lower extremity swelling, shortness of breath, gingival bleeding, decreased oral intake, and ecchymosis which had been progressively getting worse over the past 6 months. The patient’s course prior to admission included failed treatment with corticosteroids for suspected vasculitis/undifferentiated connective tissue disease and multiple transfusions in the setting of persistent anemia. The patient presented with a heart rate at 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/59, respiratory rate at 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed an extremely pale-appearing individual who had poor dental hygiene with mild pooling of blood in the oral cavity, diffuse joint swelling with ecchymosis , perifollicular petechiae with some corkscrew hairs , tenderness in the lower extremities, and decreased breath sounds with mild crackles.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Peripheral ecchymosis which is commonly found as a cutaneous manifestation of scurvy.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Corkscrew hair and perifollicular petechiae which are commonly seen in scurvy.</u>\n\n【8】The patient’s labs were significant for hemoglobin: 6.6 g/dl (ref: 12.0–15.3 g/dl), prothrombin time/internalized normalized ratio (PT-INR): 1.50 (ref: 0.87–1.17), platelets: 152 K/uL (ref: 140–400 K/uL), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP): 2714 pg/ml (ref: 0–299 pg/ml), folate <2.0 ng/ml (ref: >4.5 ng/ml), and thiamine <7 nmol/L (ref: 8–30 nmol/L). Blood cultures came back positive for Streptococcus anginosus in 2/4 bottles, for which she was initially treated with amoxicillin/sulbactam and later transitioned to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for a total of 14 days. In the setting of persistent anemia and acute worsening thrombocytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy was done and showed dyserythropoiesis, nuclear cytoplasmic asynchrony, and erythroid hyperplasia. A peripheral blood smear described increased anisocytosis of the red blood cells, left-shifted neutrophils with immature forms present, and small-to-medium platelets with normal morphology. A ventilation/perfusion scan was done which ruled out pulmonary embolism. Full vasculitis and viral workup was negative. Urine toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines and morphine/codeine.\n\n【9】Given her constellation of symptoms and poor nutrition, scurvy was on the differential and was started on daily vitamin C supplementation. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was ordered in the setting of bacteremia, which was negative to vegetation but was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 86 mmHg, dilated inferior vena cava with a right atrial pressure of 15 mmHg, and severely enlarged right ventricle with flattening of the interventricular septum positive for D-sign . The left ventricle was concentrically hypertrophic with an ejection fraction of 70% and had a left ventricular outflow tract septal obstruction from an enlarged right ventricle. These findings further decreased suspicion for septic cardiomyopathy as TTE findings did not correlate and the patient continued to have symptoms despite antibiotic treatment. Although rare, thoracic medicine suspected the pulmonary hypertension was secondary to scurvy, and it would resolve with vitamin C supplementation as had been described in a few case reports. The decision was made to defer starting diuretic therapy or vasodilators. Ascorbic acid levels returned severely deficient two days after initiation of supplements at <0.1 mg/L, ref: 0.3–2.7 mg/dl. Within a week, the patient reported improvement in her shortness of breath, lower extremity tenderness, and gingival bleeding. She was discharged with vitamin C 500 mg twice daily and a follow-up right heart catheterization with TTE two weeks after initial initiation of supplementation.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 This image was obtained by the transthoracic echocardiogram using a parasternal short-axis view. There is increased pressure/volume in the right ventricle and flattening of the interventricular septum creating a D-shaped right ventricle (known as a D-sign). In our case, this right ventricular strain is secondary to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature.</u>\n\n【11】Repeat TTE was negative for any indications of pulmonary hypertension: the right ventricle size and right atrial pressure (3 mmHg) were normal. Right heart catheterization had a baseline mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 19, wedge pressure of 10, and pulmonary vasculature resistance (PVR) of 1 WU. Postsaline mPAP was 29, wedge pressure was 15, and PVR was 1.7 WU. Findings did not meet criteria for pulmonary hypertension, however did suggest mild noncompliance of the pulmonary vasculature that can be explained by mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【12】The patient was assessed by cardiology two years later with resolution of her shortness of breath and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension noted on examination.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Pulmonary hypertension is a rare symptom of vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) that has not been thoroughly investigated with documentation only in a handful of case reports. In our case, the patient’s severe pulmonary hypertension resolved after 2 weeks of vitamin C supplementation. When comparing our patient’s presentation with previous cases, there were similarities such as dilation of the right ventricle, elevated BNP, and rapid resolution of pulmonary hypertension with vitamin C supplementation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Unlike other cases documented in the past, our case can confirm continued resolution of pulmonary hypertension at least two years after initiation of supplementation.\n\n【15】The exact mechanism of how scurvy leads to pulmonary hypertension is still unclear. One theory is that vitamin C acts as a reducing agent to activate EGLN prolyl hydroxylase which in turn hydroxylates HIFa. Hydroxylated HIFa is then targeted by von Hippel–Lindau protein for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. When vitamin C is low, there are increased levels of HIFa which binds with transcription factor HIFb to upregulate transcription of vasoconstrictive genes such as vasoconstrictor endothelin (EDN1) that increase pulmonary vasoconstriction and smooth muscle proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>. This mechanism is similar to vitamin C’s role as a cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases for collagen synthesis, where a lack of it is attributable to many of scurvy’s common manifestations such as poor wound healing, gingival bleeding, and arthralgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Vitamin C has also been shown to increase nitrous oxide synthase (NOS) activity by degrading asymmetric dimethyl L-arginine (NOS inhibitor), inhibiting arginase (increased L-arginine to be used to make NO), and increasing the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) (essential cofactor of NOS). Therefore, vitamin C deficiency leads to decreased availability of NO and consequently pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased vascular tone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In developed countries, smoking history, long-term alcoholism, low income, obesity, psychiatric illness, old age, and voluntarily restrictive diets are risk factors for scurvy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10\\]</u>. In particular, smokers have increased risk of attaining pulmonary hypertension secondary to scurvy as they have three times less vitamin C than nonsmokers and have higher incidences of hypoxia which also increase the levels of HIF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 11\\]</u>. Our patient had a long-term history of smoking, psychiatric illness, poor diet, and poor oral intake which all contributed to her vitamin C deficiency. The presumed rarity of the disease may also be inaccurate as some studies have shown the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency can be as high as 25% in low-income families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is therefore important to keep in mind these risk factors so that diagnosis and treatment can occur early before irreversible damage occurs.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】In conclusion, we present a case of pulmonary hypertension secondary to vitamin C deficiency that rapidly resolved and continued to be resolved two years later with supplementation. As there are no current guidelines recommending looking for vitamin C deficiency as a culprit for pulmonary hypertension, it is likely that many cases are missed. We believe that all individuals with the risk factors outlined above who are found to have pulmonary hypertension should be screened for vitamin C deficiency.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:12:26", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:14:01", "cost": 94.751}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:14:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:12:26"}

Primary infection in those over the age of 40 is associated with an atypical and often more severe presentation that can lead to more extensive and invasive, and often unnecessary, diagnostic testing. The incidence of severe EBV-related illness in older adults has been observed to be increasing in industrialized nations. The characteristic presentation of infectious mononucleosis (IM) syndrome in elderly patients (age > 65) is not clearly defined in the literature. Here, we describe a case of primary EBV infection in an 80-year-old female and review the literature regarding primary seroconversion in elderly patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Report\n\n【3】An 80-year-old female with a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and splenectomy presented to our institution with seven days of fevers at night, chills, night sweats, and weight loss. She lived with her husband and was independent in her activities of daily living. She was asymptomatic one week prior to initial presentation to the emergency room. Upon admission, she appeared fatigued with an exam remarkable for icterus, enlarged right neck and left supraclavicular lymph nodes (LNs), hepatomegaly, and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory tests revealed a WBC of 19.7 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L with a differential of 31% neutrophils, 58% lymphocytes, and 11% monocytes. Liver function tests (LFTs) revealed an alkaline phosphatase of 595 μ/L, aspartate aminotransferase of 281 μ/L, alanine aminotransferase of 200 μ/L, and a total bilirubin of 2 mg/dL. Abdominal ultrasound noted multiple enlarged porta hepatis LNs and findings suggestive of choledocholithiasis. MRCP revealed no choledocholithiasis or ductal dilatation but revealed significant interaortocaval, periportal, and common hepatic enlarged LNs. A CT scan of the chest revealed enlarged bilateral axillary and significant anterior and superior mediastinal LNs suggestive of lymphoma. An infectious disease workup was negative for viral hepatitis, mononucleosis (monospot test), coccidiomycosis, ehrlichiosis, rickettsia, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, CMV, and toxoplasmosis, and blood cultures were also negative. An excisional biopsy of a right neck LN revealed an atypical lymphoid proliferation. The surgical team initially recommended a mediastinoscopy with mediastinal LN sampling for a more adequate specimen, but a multidisciplinary group meeting concluded that ultrasound-guided needle percutaneous liver parenchyma and periportal LNs biopsies should be performed due to lower invasiveness and higher diagnostic yield potential. Liver and retroperitoneal LN core biopsies revealed an atypical lymphoid infiltrate . EBV anti-EBNA and anti-VCA IgG/IgM were nonreactive; however, serum EBV DNA by PCR was elevated (146,500 copies/mL), suggesting acute systemic EBV infection. Furthermore, in situ hybridization analysis of the liver and LN tissue specimens was diffusely positive for EBV-encoded RNA , further confirming EBV as the cause of her constellation of symptoms in our seronegative patient. Immunoperoxidase stains of tissue specimen revealed an atypical lymphoid infiltrate composed of a mixed population of both B- and T-cells. A Ki-67 stain indicated that the infiltrate appeared proliferative. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping identified lymphocytes comprising 78% of total cells and consisted of a mixture of phenotypically unremarkable T-cells (66%), polytypic B-cells (32%), and NK cells (2%). There did not appear to be atypical expression of CD4 and CD8 stains. The histologic and flow cytometric immunophenotyping were not diagnostic of a B-cell, T-cell, or Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The patient was started on ganciclovir and subsequently switched to valganciclovir for 3 weeks on discharge.

Discussion\n\n【7】EBV is the cause of IM and is a virus of the family Herpesviridae, which consists of a linear DNA core surrounded by a nucleocapsid and an envelope that contains glycoprotein. IM occurs most commonly in younger children, with a second peak in adolescence. By adulthood, 90% of individuals have been infected and have antibody to the virus. The incidence of IM in persons over the age of 35 is two to four per 100,000 per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Young children are asymptomatic or present with mild pharyngitis, fever, fatigue, and myalgia. In contrast, elderly patients present with longer fevers, jaundice, lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. A study of 27 patients with IM aged 40 to 72 years revealed fever during the entire illness occurring in about 93% of elderly patients, with 37% of the patients exhibiting fevers for 14 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Approximately 52% of the patients in the study also required hospitalization. Posterior cervical, anterior cervical, and absence of lymphadenopathy occurred in 40%, 16%, and 44% of elderly patients, respectively. Elderly patients with IM also have a higher prevalence of hyperbilirubinemia, with levels greater than 2 mg/dL occurring in 30% of patients relative to 3% in patients 35 years of age and younger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The literature review of case reports of elderly patients with IM also revealed significant elevations in bilirubin and LFTs . These findings often erroneously mislead clinicians toward a diagnosis of choledocholithiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. Elderly patients with IM consistently lack lymphocytosis, and the prevalence of heterophile-negative IM increases with age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6–8\\]</u>. A study of elderly patients with IM revealed positive titers of anti-EBV-VCA IgM, anti-EBV-VCA IgG, anti-EBV EA-IgG, and anti-EBV-EBNA in 55.6%, 88.9%, 85.2%, and 92.6% of patients, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In contrast to all previously published cases, our patient had negative serologies but showed significant elevation in EBV viral load. Conclusively, in comparison to younger patients with IM elderly patients tend to present with longer duration of illness with prolonged fevers, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and rashes. Laboratory results frequently reveal marked hyperbilirubinemia, significant elevation in LFT, negative heterophile-antibody test, and lack of lymphocytosis .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 The literature review of case reports of elderly patients (>65) with primary EBV infectious mononucleosis.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Common characteristics of infectious mononucleosis in elderly patients in comparison to younger patients.</u>\n\n【10】EBV infection is associated with the development of B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Subsets of patients also develop chronic-active EBV infection that involves progressive and recurrent IM symptoms with organ involvement and high EBV viral load over a longer period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Treatment of EBV IM is usually supportive, and most cases of hepatitis resolve spontaneously. The use of steroids in acute EBV infection is controversial and should be considered only in patients with life-threatening infections. Antiviral medications and steroids reduce oropharyngeal shedding of the virus temporarily but have no clinical benefit compared to placebo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Our patient was successfully treated with antiviral therapy, which resulted in prompt resolution of her presenting complaints. The literature review revealed that supportive care was the mainstay of treatment in elderly patients with EBV IM . Presumptive diagnoses such as lymphoma secondary to significant lymphadenopathy, leukemia due to presence of atypical lymphocytosis, choledocholithiasis, or fever of unknown origin (FUO) can lead to delayed diagnosis and unnecessary invasive procedures. These unnecessary procedures in elderly patients with IM are due to both older age at presentation and atypical clinical presentation. Performed procedures include excisional biopsies, bone marrow aspiration and biopsies, bronchoscopies, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. Consideration of this disease entity is essential in elderly patients with presumptive diagnoses of lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemias, cholestatic jaundice, and FUO. Tests for specific EBV antibodies should be obtained, and if negative and clinical suspicion remains high, EBV viral load PCR analysis should be performed. Our case highlights the benefit of antiviral treatment for severe disease in immunocompromised elderly patients, as our patient had a recovery in one week. In addition, our study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach when caring for elderly patients with unusual clinical presentations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:18:04", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:18:57", "cost": 52.855}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:18:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:18:03"}

Five patents were studied (four boys, one girl; age range: 15 months to 13 years old). Computed tomography showed localized cylindrical bronchiectasis in all five patients. After removal of the foreign body by bronchoscopy, the prognoses were good. Patients with localized cylindrical bronchiectasis should be examined to exclude foreign body.

Objectives and Design\n\n【5】We retrospectively reviewed five patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis due to FB retention from January 2014 to January 2019.

Results\n\n【7】Patients characteristics are listed in Table 1. The five patients comprised four boys and one girl with ages ranging from 15 months to 13 years (mean: 6.7 years). The FB identified included a sunflower seed, teeth, two nut, and a tapioca pearl . The patients presented with recurrent cough, fever, or wheezing; one patient also experienced hemoptysis. Physical examination found wheezing in two cases, wet rales in one case, and decreased breath sounds in one case. One patient had basic disease, and the others were normal. None had histories of typical aspiration. The FB location was the left lower lobe in two patients, and the right lower lobe in three patients. CT showed inflammation, emphysema, and localized bronchiectasis. Bronchographic examination revealed granulation tissue formation in three patients. Repeated X-ray examination showed that bronchiectasis disappeared after 1 or 6 months.

However, approximately 500 patients admitted for FB aspiration in our hospital per year; therefore, the incidence of bronchiectasis in our study was lower than reported.\n\n【12】In our study, the mean age of patients with bronchiectasis due to FB was higher than that of all patients with FB. In addition, all the patients do not have histories of FB aspiration. The FBs were usually organic. CT revealed that bronchiectasis caused by FB was localized cylindrical bronchiectasis, mainly located in the lower lobes.\n\n【13】Aronoff reported in a systematic review that 18 of 989 patients, approximately 2%, with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis had FB aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The risk of bronchiectasis depends on the size, shape, localization, and the retention time of the FB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The type of the FB and the time of retention within the tracheobronchial system are the most important factors. It has also been reported that the risk of bronchiectasis increases with retention time from aspiration to diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Sirmali et al. reported that the earliest case of bronchiectasis developed 25 days after aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, FB aspiration does not always lead to bronchiectasis, even after 4-5 years. Therefore, the occurrence of bronchiectasis is likely determined by several factors.\n\n【14】Because many patients do not report histories of FB aspiration and do not experience typical aspiration symptoms, this disease is often missed, making diagnosis more challenging. Doctors of patients with impaired mental statuses or swallowing mechanisms should be more vigilant about the possibility of FB inhalation, as was the scenario in one of our cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. CT or bronchoscopic examination should be performed for patients with long-term cough, who are nonresponsive to routine treatment, who experience repeated occurrences of the same symptoms, have recurrent or persistent consolidations in the same location, or have unexplained hemoptysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Furthermore, obtaining a proper history is crucial. Whenever a choking episode is mentioned in the patient’s history, tracheobronchoscopy is indicated without relying on other diagnostic tools 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Recently, flexible bronchoscopy is also recommended for children newly diagnosed with bronchiectasis to exclude a foreign body or obstructive lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Bronchoscopic removal of a retained FB may be difficult because of the presence of granulation tissue and copious secretions. In one of our case, the granulation tissue was lysed and frozen with liquid nitrogen before removal. In our study, all five patients recovered completely after successful FB removal. After 1–6 months, a repeat CT showed that the bronchiectasis had disappeared. Vergnon reported a case who had bronchiectasis due to pen cap retention for 41 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The successful removal of the cap leads to significant recovery, avoiding further invasive approach. It has been reported that neglected, inorganic FBs can cause permanent bronchiectasis after several years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. These patients sometimes require lobectomy because of recurrent infection after removal of FB. As long as the FB is diagnosed early and removed by bronchoscopy, the need for lobectomy and the risk of mortality can be reduced.\n\n【16】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【17】To reduce the risk of bronchiectasis secondary to FB aspiration, proper histories must be obtained. In addition, CT or bronchoscopic examination should be performed for patients with long-term cough, repeated occurrences of the same symptoms, recurrent or persistent consolidation in the same location in the lungs, or unexplained hemoptysis. Impaired mental statuses or swallowing mechanism in patients should arise suspicion of FB aspiration. Finally, patients with localized cylindrical bronchiectasis should be examined for FB aspiration.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:22", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:31", "cost": 9.084}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:22"}

Although generally well tolerated, adverse effects such as gastroesophageal reflux and oesophageal and peptic ulceration may occur. Oral mucositis and ulceration are lesser-known side effects. Proper counselling and rigorous adherence to the administration instructions are crucial. We describe a case of bisphosphonate-induced severe oral mucosal ulceration in an elderly woman that was caused by incorrect instructions and/or incorrect understanding of instructions for oral alendronate intake.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Oral bisphosphonates such as alendronate and risedronate are amongst the most commonly prescribed medications for the treatment of osteoporosis in men over the age of 50 and in postmenopausal women. They have been in clinical use for this purpose since 1970 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Dental and orthopaedic surgeons as well as physicians involved in the care of osteoporosis are well aware of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), a rare but calamitous problem that has been associated with oral and intravenous bisphosphonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Patients are also usually counselled on gastric and oesophageal side effects of the oral bisphosphonates and are instructed to stay upright for at least 30–45 minutes after taking these oral agents to avoid esophagatis. Less well-known side effects are the oral mucosal lesions that may be associated with the use of these agents of which very few reports in the scientific literature databases exist. Most of the ones reported were in situations where the patients could not follow the instructions given for proper intake of the medication due to associated mental and or physical comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. We describe a case of severe oral mucosal ulceration in a patient with no such comorbidities which is presumed secondary to inadequate instructions about proper intake of the medication. The mucositis had a clear temporal association with intake of oral alendronate tablets. Written permission was obtained from the patient for taking anonymized photographs of her. Permission was also obtained to write and submit a case report to a scientific journal.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 79-year-old Chinese female accompanied by her daughter was seen at the complicated metabolic bone disorders clinic of our hospital for a second opinion on the management of her severe osteoporosis. She stated that she had been started on oral alendronate about two weeks ago, but had developed an “allergy” to it and therefore wanted an alternative medication. She had a history of left ankle fracture in 2017. Axial dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan of the hip and spine showed a T score of −3.8 at the left femoral neck and −3.5 at the lumbar spine. She had no other medical problems other than dyslipidemia for which she had been taking lovastatin for several years. She had been started on generic alendronate tablet 70 mg/week by the physician. She took the first dose on 12 September. On 13 September, she started to experience gum pain with food intake and noticed a small oral ulcer of approximately 1 cm on the hard palate. She dismissed it without giving it much importance. By the 19<sup>th</sup> of September, when she took the 2<sup>nd</sup> dose of alendronate, the ulcer had increased in size . By now, the oral pain had increased, and she found it difficult to take any food that was not soft or sweet. The ulcer had increased in size and had extended to the upper gum . She went back to the general practitioner on 21 September who diagnosed her with oral thrush and prescribed an antifungal oral gel. The ulceration by then had progressed rapidly to involve the tongue and the inside of the left side of the lip, and she could only tolerate a liquid diet. She had a fever with temperatures up to 38.5 degree Celsius that lasted for about 8 hours that subsided with oral acetaminophen tablets. She had no previous history of oral ulcers or gastric problems. No skin lesions were present. Other mucosal surfaces such as the eyes and genitalia were not affected.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Appearance of the oral cavity on the 19<sup>th</sup> of September prior to the second dose of alendronate. Mucosal ulceration with some sloughing noted on the hard palate.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Appearance of the oral cavity on the 21<sup>st</sup> of September with extension of oral ulcer to the upper gum and sloughing.</u>\n\n【8】In view of the accelerated spread of the oral ulceration, the family decided to consult a dentist who referred the patient urgently to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of September . The surgeon diagnosed her to have an “allergic” reaction secondary to alendronate and asked her to no longer take alendronate. She was prescribed oral prednisolone, antiseptic mouth rinse, and antiseptic gel with some improvement of the oral ulceration and pain. She attended the metabolic bone disorders clinic on the 25<sup>th</sup> of September. On examination in our clinic, she was found to be a well-nourished elderly lady with no evidence of systemic malaise. She complained of some pain on opening her mouth. Examination of the mouth revealed a well delineated 3 × 4 cm sloughy erosion with irregular margin affecting the hard palate and surface of the tongue with erosions at the angles of the mouth . On palpation, induration was felt along the margins. On further questioning, the patient’s daughter stated that what she had understood of the instructions given to her by the pharmacist who dispensed the medicine was specifically that the medicine should be put in the mouth to be dissolved by saliva, to sit upright for 45 minutes and then to drink water. It was not clear to us if the instructions given had been misunderstood or if incorrect instructions had been given. Given the temporal association of exposure and our knowledge of potential chemically induced mucosal erosions with bisphosphonates, we made a diagnosis of alendronate-induced mucosal ulceration most likely caused by direct prolonged contact of the oral mucosa with the chemical agent. She reported to us 2 weeks later that she had fully recovered. A photograph taken at 1-month postepisode showed normal, edentulous oral cavity . This further confirmed our diagnosis.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Appearance of oral cavity on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of September (10 days after the first dose of alendronate) with extensive involvement of the oral mucosa and angles of the mouth.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Appearance of the oral ulcer on the 25<sup>th</sup> of September upon consultation at the complicated metabolic bone disorders clinic. 3 × 4 cm sloughy erosion with irregular margin on the surface of the tongue with erosions at the angles of the mouth.</u>\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Appearance of oral cavity one month after discontinuing alendronate.</u>\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Oral bisphosphonates have been reported to cause oesophageal and gastric ulceration. However, bisphosphonate-induced oral mucositis and mucosal ulceration are uncommon, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. These most often have been due to inability to take the medication correctly due to associated mental and or physical comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. The proposed mechanisms of mucositis and mucosal ulceration with bisphosphonates include the cytotoxic effect of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates on the epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> as well as the direct irritant effect of the drug on the mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The lesions need to be differentiated from other causes of erosive ulceration including apthous ulcers and that due to trauma and infection. The most common cause of traumatic ulceration is due to ill-fitting dentures and sharp-edged crowns. Such ulcers usually do not demonstrate induration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient was edentulous and had her dentures for a long time prior and had not reported any problems with them before. Ulcers due to infections, for example, viral infections, generally occur as multiple small ulcerations. They present initially as fluid-filled vesicles, which then break down to form small ulcers with irregular margins. These may subsequently coalesce to form large irregular ulcers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Apthous ulcers are usually small and round lesions covered often with a pseudomembrane and surrounded by erythematous haloes. The cause remains unknown though viral infections, B12 deficiency, etc. have been postulated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Oral lichen planus usually presents as bilateral lesions on the buccal mucosa with a symmetrical lace-like pattern. Ulceration rarely may be seen within the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune bullous disease, is characterized by bullae formation that subsequently develops into painful, shallow, irregular ulcers. Nikolsky sign—the pathognomonic sign of pemphigus—is usually present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Our patient did not have any evidence to suggest that this was pemphigus vulgaris. She was also not on any other medications that cause oral ulcerations such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), beta blockers, immunosuppressants, anti-inflammatory, or immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Withdrawal of medication and symptomatic management are the mainstay of treatment for bisphosphonate-associated oral mucositis. It is imperative that healthcare providers provide detailed and proper counselling on the proper administration technique of oral bisphosphonates. Alendronate and other similar oral bisphosphonates should be taken first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a full glass of plain water at least 30 mins to 1 hour before other food, drinks, and medications. Alendronate should be swallowed whole without chewing, and patients should remain in the upright position for at least 30 mins. Healthcare providers should avoid usage of alendronate in patients who cannot sit upright for 30 mins and in those with a history of dysphagia, reflux, and esophagitis. Reintroduction of alendronate is possible after the resolution of the ulcer and strict adherence to proper administration procedure.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【16】Although oral bisphosphonates are generally well tolerated, oral mucosal ulcerations and mucositis can develop due to improper administration such as sucking, chewing, or holding it in the oral cavity for prolonged periods of time. Proper counselling and rigorous adherence to the administration instructions are key to prevent this complication. Osteoporosis is more common in elderly individuals, and they are more likely to be started on these medications. They often may not understand instructions, and especially in such patients, instructions should be reinforced, and patients should be encouraged to recite back to the physician or the dispensing pharmacist the instructions to make sure that they have understood them. No detail is too small when counselling patients on the proper administration of these potent medications, and it is the responsibility of the healthcare provider to ensure that the patient has understood the instructions. It is also important for healthcare providers to recognise this side effect to allow for prompt withdrawal of the medication upon its identification.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:40:40", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:41:16", "cost": 35.554}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:41:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:40:40"}

This diagnosis is difficult due to challenging radiographic interpretations of multiple imaging modalities. We present a case of a 60-year-old male, who presented to his pulmonologist and underwent a CT chest with IV contrast that initially suggested primary lung carcinoma. CT angiogram showed significant vascular filling defects suspicious of an intravascular mass, rather than vascular invasion by lung lesions. The PET/CT scans further suggested a malignant process, but indistinguishable between an extravascular or intravascular etiology. Taking these results together, they suggested an intravascular malignancy, prompting a tissue biopsy, which ultimately led to a diagnosis of PAIS with metastases. Establishing a definitive diagnosis is essential as treatment and prognosis are different for sarcoma compared to carcinoma. There is no standard treatment to date, and management often includes a multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. PAIS is a rare entity that cannot be diagnosed clinically and needs a multimodality approach for its diagnosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma (PAIS) is a rare tumor with poor prognosis that mimics conditions such as pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm, extravascular tumor invasion, and thromboembolism. Often, there are diagnostic delays as symptoms are nonspecific and diagnostic investigations can be time consuming. PAIS is a rare entity, and our case demonstrates the extensive clinical and radiographical investigations necessary to establish this diagnosis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 60-year-old African American male presented to his pulmonologist with a one-month history of persistent productive cough. He has been producing clear mucous, without any blood. His cough has been progressively worse throughout the past month. His cough was worse during the day and exacerbated by cold beverages and cold air. The patient denied other symptoms including shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, hemoptysis, subjective fevers, chills, or night sweats. He denied typical symptoms for seasonal allergies and gastroesophageal reflux. The patient has a past medical history of sickle cell trait and atrial fibrillation. His past surgical history is notable for a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy resulting in a 150-pound weight loss five years ago. He has a family history of sickle cell disease, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, without any cancer. He also denied any weight loss, changes in appetite, dysphagia, or odynophagia. He denies any history of tobacco use or other recreational drugs but has a previous history of alcohol use. The patient has no occupational exposure to hazardous material and is a bus operator for the past several years. He denied any recent travel. He lives alone and is functional and independent at home without any need for supplemental oxygen. The patient had experienced a similar cough approximately one year prior with associated fevers, otalgia, and chest congestion. At that time, he was treated with a course of antibiotics resulting in complete resolution of his symptoms.\n\n【6】His vital signs on presentation were within normal limits, and he was saturating well above 95% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appeared comfortable and was in no respiratory distress. He was well developed and well nourished. He was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and events. Cardiovascular exam was unremarkable. Pulmonary exam revealed normal respiratory effort and normal breath sounds, with no stridor, wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. The patient also did not exhibit any palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Laboratory testing, including complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, did not reveal any abnormalities. A chest X-ray , in comparison to one year prior, revealed multiple new lung nodules. A chest CT with contrast demonstrated mediastinal adenopathy and multiple, large, round lung nodules with sharp borders predominantly in the right lung (a 3.3 cm nodule in the medial right upper lobe and two nodules in the right lower lobe, 4.8 cm and 3 cm, respectively) with mass effect on the right pulmonary artery and encasement of the right pulmonary artery, in addition to a left lower lobe nodule (2.2 cm) .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Initial chest X-ray showing multiple new pulmonary nodules.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Initial CT of the chest showing large intravascular mass encasing the right main pulmonary artery.

(c) After 3 cycles of palbociclib, the patient had stable disease.</u>\n\n【9】Given the new radiographic findings, he was sent to the hospital for additional workup and was scheduled for CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy. Tumor markers (alpha fetoprotein, B-HCG/LDH, CEA, and CA 19-9) at this time were all within the normal range. To further evaluate the patency of the pulmonary arteries, a chest CT angiogram was performed, which revealed a soft-tissue density mass in the right pulmonary artery with scattered bilateral lung parenchymal lesions concerning for metastatic pulmonary angiosarcoma with known osseous metastatic lesion involving T3 vertebrae. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right lower lung mass was nondiagnostic with some atypical spindle cells in a background of necrosis. Given the concern for spinal cord compression, an MRI of the thoracic spine was performed which revealed enhancing lesions at the T3 posterior elements with epidural involvement and compression, as well as posterior T4 vertebral body. MRI of the cervical spine was without evidence of disease. Ultimately, the patient underwent a T3 laminectomy with a T2 and T4 partial laminectomy and a posterior thoracic spine fusion of T2-T5 with screws, rods, and allograft along with resection of a spinal epidural mass. Pathologic review of the biopsied epidural mass revealed an intimal sarcoma, with epithelioid and pleomorphic features, of high grade involving bone. There were 19 mitoses per 10 high-power field. Focal tumor necrosis was present (<50%). Immunohistochemistry noted rare scattered tumor cells positive for SMA, CMA , and AE , but was negative for S100, CK 7, HMB45, CK19, CK , EMA, CD31, and CD34. GMS and AFB special stains were negative for microorganisms. Additional immunostaining performed showed that the tumor cells were positive for SMA and desmin and negative for STAT-6 and SAT2B. BCL-1 stain revealed nuclear reactivity and few scattered tumor cells. INI-1 was retained. FISH was performed and demonstrated amplification of MDM2. Furthermore, CT abdomen/pelvis was negative for any metastatic disease. The patient was discharged home with pain control and instructions to follow-up outpatient with pulmonology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and neurosurgery.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Follow-Up\n\n【11】The patient completed ten cycles of palliative radiation therapy to the T2-T5 region for a total dose of 3000 cGy. Following completion, he developed pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. He presented to a different hospital and underwent CT chest angiogram and was diagnosed with large right proximal pulmonary embolism and he was started on apixaban. He subsequently reported several episodes of blood-streaked sputum after initiation of anticoagulation. PET/CT was performed showcasing extensive hypermetabolic pulmonary nodules/masses, right much greater than left, and hypermetabolic poorly characterized right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy along with concern for right pulmonary artery invasion. The patient was followed up with medical oncology and was recommended palliative chemotherapy with doxorubicin for his diagnosis of intimal sarcoma. His transthoracic echo demonstrated a normal ejection fracture of 60–65%. His treatment course was complicated by nausea, vomiting, oral mucositis, fatigue, weight loss, and insomnia. Additionally, he developed anemia and neutropenia requiring pegfilgrastim. He later developed fever and was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient completed six cycles of doxorubicin therapy. Posttreatment CT with contrast demonstrated reduction in size of pulmonary metastases and stable-appearing nonocclusive thrombus within the right main pulmonary artery . Repeat molecular testing revealed CDK4 amplification, and he is currently receiving palbociclib. He was later admitted for shortness of breath and was newly diagnosed with systolic heart failure, likely due to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. He received three cycles of palbociclib. Repeat CT chest with contrast showed stable disease .\n\n【12】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【13】In this case, the patient presented with vague symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and weight loss. Initial imaging modalities, including chest X-ray and CT chest with contrast, were concerning for extravascular tumor compression from primary lung carcinoma. CT angiogram revealed a filling defect suspicious of an intravascular mass, rather than extravascular tumor invasion. PET/CT scan identified pulmonary artery involvement but was unable to differentiate between intravascular or extravascular etiologies. To arrive at the final diagnosis of PAIS with metastases, several different imaging modalities, in addition to a tissue biopsy, were employed.\n\n【14】A multimodal approach, utilizing several imaging modalities to visualize the thorax and vasculatures via CT, PET/CT, and MRI, is the best way to rapidly diagnose PAIS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1,2\\]</u>. The diagnostic challenge lies in the complexity of distinguishing: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> whether the mass is intravascular versus extravascular, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> whether this mass is malignant or benign, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> if the mass is intravascular, whether it is a tumor thrombus, tumor mass, or pseudoaneurysm. Other reported cases suggest that the diagnostic process is often convoluted with difficulties in establishing a diagnosis and subsequent delay in initiating appropriate therapy. To differentiate an intravascular mass from extravascular mass, a CT angiogram would be necessary to directly visualize the pulmonary vasculatures compared to a CT chest with contrast. On CT chest, PAIS is characterized by multiple pulmonary nodules and hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, in comparison to pulmonary thromboembolisms, which often have associated wedge-shaped infarcts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The “wall eclipsing sign,” where the tumor eclipses one or both walls of the main pulmonary artery or its branches, is pathognomonic for PAIS on CT angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In contrast, pulmonary thromboembolism is in the shape of a saddle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. Furthermore, high uptake on PET would suggest a malignancy, whereas low uptake would suggest a nonmalignant etiology such as pulmonary thomboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>. Prior case reports utilized and integrated the findings of all three modalities in order to rapidly diagnose PAIS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>. Cardiac MRI can be utilized to discern neoplastic from thrombotic components by allowing proper visualization of the vasculature and tissue edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In addition, PAIS demonstrates diffusion restriction and heterogeneous enhancement, in comparison to pulmonary thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Tissue biopsy by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration followed by immunohistochemistry remains gold standard for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, the endobronchial biopsy was unrevealing, but a biopsy of the metastatic mass confirmed the diagnosis. Establishing a definitive diagnosis is essential as treatment and prognosis vary drastically for PAIS, pulmonary thromboembolism, and other mimics such as lung carcinoma. It is interesting as this patient was diagnosed with both PAIS and later pulmonary embolism.\n\n【16】There is no standard treatment to date, and management often includes a multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Surgery is considered first-line treatment in order to relieve pulmonary artery obstruction and associated pulmonary hypertension and to palliate symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Surgical intervention is dependent on the location on the extension of the mass and can include pulmonary endarterectomy, pneumonectomy, or a lobectomy. Additionally, surgery is noncurative as it is difficult to achieve clear margins; therefore, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation are utilized, in addition to surgery, to achieve better disease control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. For systemic therapy, anthracyclines are most commonly used along with taxanes, ifosfamide, platinum, and gemcitabine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Despite the above treatment options, prognosis remains poor due to the difficulty in achieving complete disease control. In the metastatic setting, chemotherapy and radiation therapy should be considered prior to any surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In the presented case, given the high-grade nature of PAIS with pulmonary and bone metastasis, palliative chemotherapy with doxorubicin was considered. After six cycles of doxorubicin, the patient had a partial response to his disease; hence, palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) was considered. Among several other alterations, CDK4 amplification was found to be prominent in intimal sarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The role of palbociclib treatment of intimal sarcomas with CDK4 amplification is still under investigation and remains unclear.\n\n【17】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】PAIS is a rare entity often resembling lung carcinoma or pulmonary thromboembolism as a result of nonspecific symptomatology and analogous imaging findings, thereby delaying diagnosis and treatment. There is no standard of treatment for PAIS and its treatment often involves a multidisciplinary approach, with anthracyclines as the main systemic agent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:12", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:25", "cost": 13.489}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:38", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:11"}

Prior case reports have described how this rare anomaly could impact clinical care, either as a source of unexplained chronic midfoot pain or as a potential for misdiagnosis as a fracture in the setting of midfoot trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We present a case report of a Lisfranc fracture in a patient with a bipartite medial cuneiform, an association that has not yet been described in the literature. Our case furthered exemplifies how knowledge of the bipartite medial cuneiform plays a role in both conservative and surgical treatment. Additionally, as we have encountered this anomaly only very rarely, we sought to determine the prevalence of the bipartite medial cuneiform with a retrospective review of 1,000 consecutive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Materials/Method\n\n【6】The clinical and imaging findings of a patient with a Lisfranc fracture with a bipartite medial cuneiform were reviewed. This case led to a retrospective, cross-sectional, observation study that was approved by the Institutional Review Board with waiver of informed consent. One thousand MR imaging scans of the foot that were performed at our institution from January of 2007 to February of 2013 were reviewed. The typical MR imaging protocol included axial T1, axial proton density (fat sat), sagittal T1, sagittal T2 fast spin echo (fat sat), coronal T1, coronal T2 fast spin echo (fat sat) and coronal proton density (fat sat) sequences. Patients were selected on the basis of availability of MR imaging scans for review. Exclusion criteria were lack of available images (off-site storage) or artifacts due to excessive motion or metal. The findings in the case report were reviewed in consensus by a radiology resident (Geraldine Chang) and fellowship trained musculoskeletal radiologist (Eric Y. Chang, two years of experience) and thereafter the remainder of the MR images in the retrospective review were reviewed by the radiology resident (Geraldine Chang). Age and biological sex were also recorded.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【8】##### 3.1. Case Report\n\n【9】A 31-year-old man presented to the emergency department after a skateboarding accident. The patient stated that he twisted his left foot and struck the dorsum of the foot against a curb. Pain was localized to his midfoot and worsened with weight bearing. Patient also reported a feeling of foot instability.\n\n【10】Physical examination revealed ecchymosis and edema on the dorsum of the left foot. There was extreme tenderness throughout the Lisfranc articulation, but mostly in the region of the first and second rays. Overall, alignment of the foot was within normal limits. Range of motion of the ankle was preserved. Motor strength was decreased secondary to discomfort. Intact sensation and brisk capillary refill were also noted.\n\n【11】Radiographs, computed tomography (CT) images, and MR images 通用删除1(英):<u>(refer to Figures 1 and 2)</u> revealed a Lisfranc injury in the setting of a bipartite medial cuneiform. MR images demonstrated the attachment site of the plantar Lisfranc ligament to the plantar segment of the medial cuneiform and the attachment site of the Lisfranc ligament proper and dorsal Lisfranc ligament to the dorsal segment of the medial cuneiform. Orthopedic consultation was obtained and patient underwent operative exploration, which demonstrated a dislocation of the first and second tarsometatarsal joints and a comminuted fracture of the medial and intermediate cuneiforms. Patient underwent open treatment with internal fixation.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Axial CT images at the level of the midfoot show a Lisfranc fracture of the medial cuneiform.

Subjects’ age ranged from 17 to 92 years with a mean age of 45 years. There were 803 male and 197 female subjects. There was a 0.1% incidence of the bipartite medial cuneiform based on our review of 1000 MR imaging studies of the ankle.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【16】The bipartite medial cuneiform is a rare tarsal developmental variant at the Lisfranc joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Differentiating this osseous variation from a fracture is important to both clinicians and radiologists. In addition, the bipartite medial cuneiform can be a potential source for nontraumatic or traumatic midfoot pain, and knowledge of this entity can play a role in both conservative and surgical treatment. A previous anthropologic population study in 1942 found this anomaly to occur in approximately 0.3% of persons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A case series and literature review by Elias et al. described the MR imaging features of the bipartite medial cuneiform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. To our knowledge, however, our case report is the first to show a Lisfranc fracture in the setting of a bipartite medial cuneiform. These findings prompted a retrospective review to determine the frequency of the bipartite medial cuneiform based on MR imaging.\n\n【17】The bipartition of the medial cuneiform is a malsegmentation defect of the foot characterized by separation of the normal cuneiform into dorsal and plantar segments due to the presence of two primary ossification centers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 6–9\\]</u>. It is the failure of fusion of these two ossicles that results in a bipartite medial configuration. The ossification process in this bone begins in the second to third year of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7–9\\]</u>. In many cases, these segments are held together by means of a cartilaginous or fibrocartilaginous bridge.\n\n【18】In this anomaly, the cuneiform bone is divided horizontally by a synchondrosis, partitioning the medial cuneiform into plantar and dorsal segments. The plantar ossicle is typically larger than the dorsal ossicle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The tibialis anterior tendon attaches to the proximal superomedial aspect of the dorsal segment. The posterior tibialis tendon attaches to the distal inferolateral portion of the plantar segment. The peroneus longus tendon attaches to the proximal inferomedial and distal inferolateral portions of the plantar segment. The Lisfranc ligament proper (interosseous portion) and the dorsal Lisfranc ligament extend from the dorsal segment of the bipartite medial cuneiform to insert into the base of the second metatarsal. The plantar Lisfranc ligament extends from the plantar segment of the bipartite medial cuneiform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Based on our review of the literature, the bipartite medial cuneiform is generally an incidental finding but one that rarely can be symptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 10\\]</u>. Chiodo et al. reported a patient who failed conservative treatment, demonstrating that surgical excision may be indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore, it is important for radiologists and clinicians to keep bipartition of the bone in mind when evaluating acute or chronic midfoot pain.\n\n【20】In the setting of trauma, it is important to differentiate a bipartite medial cuneiform from a fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The bipartite articulation is best visualized on a 30-degree external oblique radiograph of the foot. The site of partition should demonstrate smooth, well corticated margins, and the two portions of the bipartite cuneiform together are larger than the expected normal or fractured medial cuneiform. In addition, all cases of a bipartite medial cuneiform demonstrate bipartition along the long axis of the foot, and this orientation is uncommon for a fracture. Furthermore, with MR imaging, an asymptomatic bipartite medial cuneiform should not have been associated with bone marrow edema. Due to the well-defined joint space between the base of the first metatarsal and the distal portion of the medial bipartite cuneiform as well as between the two bipartite portions, a “E” joint space configuration is demonstrated on MR imaging in the sagittal plane, the so-called E-sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【21】We are the first to report a Lisfranc fracture in the setting of this anomaly. Our patient had both CT and MR imaging. The Lisfranc ligament proper and the plantar Lisfranc ligament attached to different portions of the bipartitioned bone. In our case, both ossicles were fractured and the patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation.\n\n【22】To our knowledge, our series is the only one to date dealing with the frequency of the bipartite medial cuneiform in persons undergoing MR imaging. In our retrospective review of 1000 patients, we found a 0.1% incidence, which is lower than that reported in anthropological studies.\n\n【23】There are limitations to our study. Our subjects included an uneven distribution of male and female subjects. In addition, the age range of our subject population was 17–92 with the exclusion of the pediatric population. Further studies that include a more diverse patient population with more female and pediatric subjects are required to validate our findings. However, the reported incidence in the literature of a bipartite medial cuneiform bone has ranged from 0.3% to 2.4% in cadaveric studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our study confirms that the bipartite medial cuneiform is, in fact, very rare.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:06:08", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:07:48", "cost": 99.788}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:07:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:06:07"}

We reported two cases with pancytopenia and disseminated histoplasmosis accompanied by HLH, initially suspected to be blood malignancies. Our first case documented the relevance between the improvement of pancytopenia and the clearance of Histoplasma capsulatum in serial bone marrow aspirations. The second case showed immense Histoplasma engulfment by the macrophage in relation to a severe clinical condition, followed by improvement of clinical symptoms in accordance with the recovery of pancytopenia. These two cases highlighted the importance of comprehensive and critical analysis for cases with concurrent pancytopenia and severe infection, since it may be that the pancytopenia underlies the severe infection or vice versa.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case 1\n\n【3】A 34-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with sepsis and prolonged fever. She had a productive cough for the last month. She had no previous history of any serious illness. She was a healthy person with an active life as a civil servant who travelled a lot in the country. Peripheral blood analysis showed pancytopenia with hemoglobin levels of 7.6 g/dl, a leukocyte count of 1.35 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μl, a neutrophil count of 1.05 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μl, and a platelet count of 12 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μl. Procalcitonin was 15.69 ng/ml, albumin 1.85 g/dl, LDH 651 U/L, APTT 51.6 sec, and fibrinogen 0.62 g/L. She had negative results from any serological tests for HIV, hepatitis B, and C. Toxoplasma IgM, CMV IgM, and ANA IF were also negative. An abdominal computerized tomography (CT) showed hepatosplenomegaly, and a thorax X-ray showed bilateral pneumonia. She was initially managed with antibiotics, nutrition support, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) injection, transfusion of packed red cells and platelets, albumin infusion, and symptomatic drugs to alleviate her clinical condition. The bone marrow aspiration (BMA) was performed in the second week, after a stable clinical condition. The result was a myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS) with a refractory cytopenia multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) subtype and infection with Histoplasma capsulatum . She was given voriconazole 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours for the first 3 days. Itraconazole at a dose of 3 × 200 mg was given on days 4–6 followed by 2 × 200 mg planned for 3 months. The sequential BMA revealed a gradual loss leading to complete clearance of H. capsulatum within ten weeks of treatment . We started to observe a gradual improvement in pancytopenia and the clinical condition after the commencement of the antifungal. The blood evaluation during treatment is shown in Figure 4. She was discharged from the hospital after forty days in good condition, with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dl, a leukocyte count of 3.2 × 103/μl, a neutrophil count of 2.5 × 103/μl, and a platelet count of 73 × 103/μl. The peripheral blood profile continued to improve and returned to normal during visits to the outpatient clinic. She regained her active life when visiting our outpatient clinic five months after the last bone marrow assessment free of Histoplasma.\n\n【4】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Initial bone marrow aspiration showing myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS) with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) subtype and infection with H. capsulatum inside the macrophages (taken 2 weeks after admission and as the initial point to start antifungal treatment).</u>\n\n【5】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Bone marrow aspiration after 4 weeks of antifungal treatment showed the reduction of intracellular budding yeast of Histoplasma inside the macrophages.</u>\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Bone marrow aspiration after 10 weeks of antifungal treatment showed macrophages without Histoplasma.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Improvement in peripheral blood parameters following treatment with an antifungal in case 1.</u>\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case 2\n\n【9】A 29-year-old male was referred to our hospital due to general weakness for the last 7 months, abdominal discomfort, intermittent fever, and pancytopenia. According to his anamnesis, he was previously a healthy person without any serious illnesses. He was a computer technician and a tourist guide. He was suspected to have a blood malignancy by the previous referrer hospital due to repeated infections. He presented with several large ecchymoses in his lower extremities and trunk . An abdominal palpation revealed an enlarged liver measuring 3 cm below the costal margin and splenomegaly with Schuffner grade 2. The laboratory results revealed pancytopenia with a hemoglobin level of 6.2 g/dl, a leukocyte count of 1 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μl, a neutrophil count of 0.69 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μl, and a platelet count of 21 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μl. Procalcitonin was 2.11 ng/ml, SGOT 107 U/L, SGPT 33 U/L, total bilirubin 4.96 mg/dl with direct bilirubin 4.8 mg/dl. There was a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as indicated with fibrinogen 0.35 g/L, APTT > 400 sec, PPT > 320 sec, and D-Dimer 572 ng/mL. The serology of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and ANA IF were negative. The thorax X-ray showed bronchitis.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Large ecchymosis in the lower extremities.</u>\n\n【11】The BMA smear showed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with abundant H. capsulatum inside the macrophage cells with dyserythropoiesis and dysgranulopoiesis . Sabouraud agar was used to grow some of the BMA samples. The isolate was subsequently taken after 5 weeks and stained with methylene blue and KOH . A sensitivity test showed good response to several antifungals, such as voriconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole. The patient was managed with voriconazole 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours for 3 days, followed by itraconazole 3 × 200 mg in the first 3 days, followed by 2 × 200 mg planned for 3 months. Other therapies included intravenous antibiotics, G-CSF injection, supportive transfusion of packed red cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and albumin infusion. We observed gradual improvement in clinical and laboratory parameters during hospitalization, and the patient was discharged after 30 days. The blood evaluation during treatment is shown in Figure 8. One week after discharge, a blood evaluation showed improvement in hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dl, leukocyte count of 2.9 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μl, neutrophil count of 2.1 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μl, and platelet of count 109 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μl.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 Bone marrow aspiration at the time of diagnosis showed Histoplasma capsulatum yeasts inside the macrophages.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 Histoplasma capsulatum yeast in methylene blue (a) and KOH (b) staining taken 5 weeks after starting BMA culture in Sabouraud agar.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8 Improvement in peripheral blood parameters following treatment with an antifungal in case 2.</u>\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that primarily causes pulmonary disease. The environmental reservoir of H. capsulatum is soil. There are two varieties that are pathogenic to humans, namely, H. capsulatum var. capsulatum and H. capsulatum var. duboisii 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Forms of mycelium (H. capsulatum) are found in the soil, especially in areas contaminated with bird or bat droppings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. After a detailed anamnesis with the 2 patients, the first patient reported that her house was not far from a big poultry farm, while the second patient had some birds as pet in his backyard. Such facts may be related to the repeated infections in the two cases.\n\n【17】There is a broad range of clinical presentations for histoplasmosis, from asymptomatic to symptomatic to a severe disseminated state. Disease signs and symptoms are mediated by the host’s immune status. Other factors that play roles in the severity of the disease include the virulence of the fungal strain and the amount of inhaled inoculum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Infection in immunocompetent patients required a large quantity of inhaled H. capsulatum or exposure to a highly virulent strain of H. capsulatum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. These 2 presented cases were previously healthy individuals with no history of serious illness. Continuous exposure to a virulent strain accompanied by fluctuating immunity might have contributed to the development of severe infection in these cases.\n\n【18】Symptomatic clinical presentations include acute pulmonary disease, disseminated disease, and chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis. Symptoms of the disseminated disease include fever, weight loss, and respiratory complaints. Clinical findings may include lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, together with bone marrow toxicity on laboratory evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our two cases presented the severe clinical condition of disseminated histoplasmosis in previously immunocompetent patients, with the second case being more severe with splenomegaly, congestive hepatopathy, obstructive jaundice, frank hemorrhage, and DIC.\n\n【19】The mechanism by which histoplasmosis can cause pancytopenia may be explained by the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) phenomenon, a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome classified into primary and secondary forms通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Secondary or acquired HLH may result from a malignant, infectious, or autoimmune stimulus in the absence of an identifiable underlying genetic trigger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is characterized by uncontrolled activation of NK/CTL that provokes the release of large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF, M-CSF, and IL-2, resulting in hyperstimulation and systemic infiltration by macrophages, which in turn phagocytose blood cells, mostly red blood cell precursors, and secrete other cytokines responsible for myelosuppression, endothelial damage with coagulopathy, tissue injury, and NK/CTL incessant activation (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 8\\]</u>. The cytokine storm causes vascular endothelium damage and myelosuppression, which, in turn, induces fatal bleeding, infection, and multiorgan failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. These two cases were referred from other hospitals with pancytopenia and severe infection, which required a comprehensive and critical analysis to determine whether the pancytopenia underlies the infection or vice versa. The findings of disseminated Histoplasma infection in the BMA eventually led to the most possible explanation of HLH as the cause of pancytopenia in these cases.\n\n【20】The gold standard for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis involves either the recovery of H. capsulatum in culture from a clinical specimen or histopathological demonstration of the characteristic intracellular forms of H. capsulatum in infected tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Both of the presented cases showed the pathogen in the BMA smears. The recovery of H. capsulatum from the culture of BMA in Sabouraud agar from the second case confirmed the diagnosis.\n\n【21】The diagnosis of HLH was based on clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings. In adults, it is based on the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria in conjunction with clinical judgment and the patient’s history. The criteria included ≥ 5 of the 8 diagnostic criteria listed in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Both of our cases fulfilled 5 of the 8 diagnostic criteria for HLH in terms of fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia, hemophagocytosis in BMA, and hypofibrinogenemia.\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria.</u>\n\n【23】Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), also called ineffective hematopoiesis, are indicated by bone marrow failure and a tendency to acute myeloid leukemia transformation. It is a heterogenous group of malignancies arising from distorted hematopoietic stem cell function, inflammatory, innate immune deregulation, and multiple genomic events. Myelodysplastic syndromes are usually suspected by the presence of cytopenia on a routine analysis of peripheral blood. This prompts the evaluation of bone marrow cell morphology (aspirate) and cellularity (biopsy). The BMA allows for a detailed evaluation of cellular morphology and blast percentage. The diagnosis of MDS is established by the presence of dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. All causes of secondary bone marrow failure should be put on the list of different diagnoses for MDS, and one of them is infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Histoplasmosis infection can also cause disseminated histiocytosis. The bone marrow is hypocellular, with reduced erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the first case, the initial BMA smears were identified as MDS with an RCMD subtype and an infection with Histoplasma capsulatum. While in the second case, the BMA also showed an immense engulfment of Histoplasma by the macrophages as well as the dysplasia of the three lineages, which was similar to the MDS feature. It was not easy to judge whether the cytopenia was due to MDS or HLH caused by disseminated histoplasmosis. However, the improvement in the serial BMAs of case 1 indicated by diminishing Histoplasma along with normalization of the peripheral blood profile strongly supported a reactive bone marrow suppression, resulting in the picture of myelodysplasia at the time of diagnosis. Although we did not repeat the bone marrow aspiration after complete recovery of the peripheral blood profile in case 1, we assured the patient that the MDS was only transient or temporary.\n\n【24】The antifungal agents that have been proven to be effective and preferred for the treatment of histoplasmosis include amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, amphotericin B lipid complex, and itraconazole. For patients with moderate to severe disseminated histoplasmosis, an amphotericin B preparation is recommended for a minimum of 1–2 weeks, followed by oral itraconazole at a dose of 200 mg twice daily for a minimum of 12 months. In patients with mild to moderate disseminated histoplasmosis, itraconazole 200 mg twice a day for at least 12 months is an alternative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. Voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) were also shown to be similarly effective for empiric therapy. There were fewer severe infusion-related reactions related to voriconazole and less nephrotoxicity than with liposomal amphotericin B 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Voriconazole has been used in the treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis and disseminated histoplasmosis and may improve the clinical outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. The secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) syndrome, which follows a severe infection such as disseminated histoplasmosis, is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome that requires treatment of the inciting disease to be treated and controlled 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The use of voriconazole and itraconazole to eradicate H. capsulatum as the causative agent in our cases effectively reversed the clinical conditions in coherence with the improvement of laboratory parameters.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】We have reported two cases of transient pancytopenia as a result of reactive bone marrow suppression related to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) due to disseminated Histoplasma capsulatum infection. These two cases reminded the clinicians of the importance of comprehensive and critical analysis when finding a case of pancytopenia accompanied by severe infection. It may be the pancytopenia that underlies the severe infection, or vice versa. When the latest occurs, the eradication of the inciting agents will reverse the pancytopenia condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:56:58", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:57", "cost": 119.178}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:56:56"}

Most cases of RMS appear to be sporadic, but the disease has been associated with familial syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and neurofibromatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. There are two histologic subtypes of RMS, embryonal and alveolar; Alveolar RMS is more aggressive with small, round cells while embryonal RMS has a more favorable prognosis with spindle-shaped cells with a stromal-rich appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11, 14\\]</u>. Embryonal variants include leiomyomatous RMS that is predominantly of paratesticular origin and the botryoid variant with subepithelial aggregates of tumor cells known as the cambium layer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Sarcoma botryoides can arise from the mucosal surfaces of the cervix, bladder, or vagina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Radiologic evaluation of RMS should include CT scan or MRI of the primary and surrounding structures. Treatment approaches to RMS incorporate chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery based on risk stratification. Complete surgical resection is considered if it will not be cosmetically damaging. The five-year overall survival rate for adults with RMS is approximately 27% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The association between cervical sarcoma botryoides and ovarian SCLT has been described in at least eight patients from prior case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 17–22\\]</u>. Adjuvant ifosfamide and epiadriamycin were used in one of these patients who had recurrence of uterine disease after 6 years, and conservative polypectomy was encouraged by some authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.

To our knowledge, there have been cases reported in literature with limited treatment options. We aim to demonstrate treatment strategies used in our patients, which seemed to have prolonged their lives when compared to prior case reports of patients not cured by surgical resection, in order to provide treatment options for clinicians treating patients with these concurrent rare malignancies.\n\n【7】Patient 1 was a 32-year-old Caucasian female noted to have a left sided ovarian mass on CT scan after presenting for left lower quadrant abdominal pain. She was status post resection and pathology was consistent with stage Ia poorly differentiated SLCT. Five months later, recurrent pains lead to a trans-vaginal US that showed a right pelvic mass. She underwent radical hysterectomy and debulking procedure that showed pathology consistent with recurrent poorly differentiated SLCT with heterologous RMS. A follow-up PET scan showed uptake bilaterally in the pelvis. A month later, she was started on doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and vincristine. She was hospitalized for a small bowel obstruction with stable metastatic abdominal nodules on CT. She received cycle 2 doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and vincristine while hospitalized and had a palliative PEG placed. Her chemotherapy was changed to ifosfamide and etoposide because of mucositis and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. After a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy, she was found to be in complete clinical remission by CT. Approximately 10 months later, CT showed a liver lesion and pelvic mass consistent with recurrent poorly differentiated SLCT on repeat biopsy with no RMS elements seen. She was given 3 cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP). Bleomycin was held for cycles 4 through 8 due to side effects. A follow-up PET showed stable disease. Three months later, she was found to have a left lower quadrant mass consistent with recurrent SLCT at which point radiation therapy was given with good response with only a small amount of residual disease. Eight months later, a biopsy of a liver lesion was consistent with recurrent SLCT with no definitive RMS identified. She underwent further radiation with stable disease for approximately five months before repeat imaging showed marked disease progression with symptoms that lead to hospice care. The time from diagnosis until death was approximately four years.\n\n【8】Patient 2 was a 30-year-old, black female with a left sided ovarian mass found incidentally during a cesarean section that was initially called a granulosa tumor on pathology but later deemed SLCT with focal poor differentiation when reviewed. At the time of initial diagnosis she was thought to have stage IA disease that was cured surgically. She was lost to follow-up for 13 months at which time a follow-up CT showed a right sided ovarian mass that increased on serial imaging. Surgery for recurrence revealed a left adnexal mass, left pelvic sidewall, cul-de-sac, and anterior abdominal wall nodules with pathology consistent with high-grade sarcoma ultimately deemed embryonal RMS consistent with recurrence of the poorly differentiated SLCT. Two months later, she was started on doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and vincristine for a total of 6 cycles with follow-up CT showing NED. A repeat CT performed 7 months after chemotherapy completion showed an increasing pelvic mass that was resected. Pathology was consistent with recurrent SLCT with RMS, and a liver mass was discovered during surgery that was not seen on CT scan. She was started on salvage chemotherapy for RMS with vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide for a total of 6 cycles. Follow-up CT after cycle 4 showed NED. The patient developed massive progression 5 months after her last cycle of chemotherapy with small bowel obstruction requiring debulking surgery with colostomy placement and ultimately hospice care. The time span from diagnosis until death was approximately 3.5 years.\n\n【9】Patient 3 was a 23-year-old female who presented with nausea and vomiting with an US showing a right ovarian mass. She underwent exploratory laparotomy with debulking and removal of a large abdominal pelvic mass with a right salpingo-oophorectomy (RSO) and appendectomy. Pathology was consistent with stage IA poorly differentiated SLCT with some elements of RMS, and she was found to have a DICER1 mutation. She underwent 6 cycles of doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and vincristine and is currently NED on follow-up imaging approximately 10 months after chemotherapy was initiated.\n\n【10】In one case report, a patient with SLCT of intermediate differentiation and RMS of FIGO stage 1C was treated with surgery alone and remained with no evidence of disease (NED) at four years after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. These authors report two similar case reports with SLCT of intermediate differentiation and RMS where one patient was found to have NED at ten months after unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (USO) for stage IA disease while another patient with capsular invasion was initially treated with oophorectomy alone but had reoccurrences at months six and ten, at which time she was treated with unspecified adjuvant chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 25, 26\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Another case report describes a patient who after a unilateral oophorectomy was found to have an SLCT with focal rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, and she developed an omental mass with features consistent with high-grade sarcoma one year later. She underwent further surgery with a plan for adjuvant chemotherapy but was lost to follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Chougule et al. report a case where ovarian SLCT with RMS and borderline mucinous neoplasm was found in a 26-year-old patient after USO but no further information on treatment or follow-up was provided 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Zaloudek and Norris described a 16-year-old patient with stage Ia poorly differentiated SLCT with RMS elements who was treated with USO and later thiotepa and 5-fluorouracil after recurrence at 1.4 years. She was found to have peritoneal metastases on autopsy after her death four months later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The most recent case report of SLCT with RMS elements describes a 70-year-old patient who was diagnosed with stage Ia disease and underwent hysterectomy with left salpingo-oophorectomy (LSO), appendectomy, and omentectomy without evidence of macroscopic disease after the procedures. At 7 months postoperatively, she represented with a large abdominal mass, ascites, unilateral hydronephrosis, and a massive pulmonary embolism. She was treated palliatively and died 15 days later without subsequent autopsy performance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The largest number of case reports was presented by Prat et al. who document nine cases of SLCT with skeletal muscle elements. With one exception, all of these subjects were initially treated with surgery alone. Of those with available information, all subjects had recurrence within one year of initial treatment. Most subjects had recurrence surgically treated and most were deceased within one year. For full information on these subjects, see Table 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Summary of cases of patients with SLCT and with RMS elements.</u>\n\n【16】Discussion. Herein we describe 19 cases of SLCT with RMS elements as discussed in prior case reports as well as three cases from the authors’ institution. Of these 19 cases, five were lost to follow-up and two were documented as being NED after surgical intervention alone. Of the remaining cases, eleven patients had recurrence within one year and five of these patients were deceased within that year. Of those patients not surgically cured, only three patients were documented as living beyond two years, and all three of these patients received chemotherapy.\n\n【17】In patients with RMS, chemotherapy regimens considered in recurrent disease include vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide; ifosfamide and etoposide; and vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32, 33\\]</u>. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimens include cisplatin based combinations with etoposide/bleomycin or etoposide/ifosfamide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The three patients presented from our institution with concurrent SLCT and RMS all had clinical evidence of response to chemotherapy that is traditionally used for RMS on follow-up imaging. In conclusion, chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide has activity in patients with concurrent SLCT and RMS as does salvage chemotherapy with vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:52:29", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:52:43", "cost": 13.565}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:52:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:52:29"}

Various approaches have been described for repair of perineal hernias including open transabdominal, transperineal or combined abdominoperineal repairs.

We present a case report demonstrating the benefits of laparoscopic repair of perineal hernia following previous laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection (APR) using a nonabsorbable mesh to repair the defect. We have demonstrated that the use of laparoscopy with repair of the pelvic floor defect using a non absorbable synthetic mesh offers an excellent alternative with many potential advantages over open transabdominal and transperineal repairs.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Postoperative perineal hernia may be defined by the protrusion of intra-abdominal viscera through a defect in the pelvic floor into the perineal region. Perineal hernias are infrequent complications following abdominoperineal operations with a recent retrospective study estimating the prevalence to be 0.34% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common presenting symptoms are that of pain and a dragging sensation or discomfort on standing, but urinary symptoms, intestinal obstruction, or perineal skin breakdown may also occur. Various approaches have been described for repair of perineal hernias including open transabdominal, transperineal, or combined abdominoperineal repairs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The use of laparoscopic transabdominal repair of perineal hernias is not well-described in the medical literature to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–10\\]</u>. Concerns about the insertion of intra-abdominal meshes to close peritoneal defects are largely founded upon the risk of adhesions, mesh infection, and the potential for fistula formation. These concerns, however, are tempered by the development of new synthetic meshes used in the increasingly popular technique of laparoscopic incisional hernia repairs. These meshes are reported to reduce the incidence of mesh-related morbidity and facilitate a minimally invasive approach to reconstructive surgery for large abdominal wall defects with the recognised benefits of laparoscopy. We present a case report demonstrating the benefits of laparoscopic repair of postoperative perineal hernia following laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection (APR) using a nonabsorbable mesh to repair the defect.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 69-year-old man presented with a history of rectal bleeding. Digital rectal examination revealed a palpable, fungating rectal lesion. Following EUA and biopsy, the lesion was confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma. Staging computed tomography scans did not reveal any distant metastasis. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy a preoperative MRI showed reduction in tumour size from 8.5 to 4.7 cm. The patient successfully underwent laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection of the rectum and formation of colostomy. He was discharged day 6 postoperatively with wounds intact.\n\n【7】Histology revealed an invasive poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with extension into the perianal soft tissues. Lymphovascular space and perineural invasion were identified but all resection margins were negative for tumour. The tumour was classified as a y T 2 N 0 M 0 lesion.\n\n【8】At six-month clinical followup, he complained of a reducible, painless incisional perineal hernia extending into the scrotum . He subsequently underwent elective laparoscopic mesh repair of this perineal hernia.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Preoperative picture showing the perineal hernia defect. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【10】The operation was performed in lithotomy position. A urethral catheter was placed to decompress the bladder. Pneumoperitoneum was established using the Hassan technique via a curvilinear infraumbilical incison. Three additional 5 mm ports were placed under direct vision using a 10 mm 0° laparoscope. One was positioned in the right lower quadrant, one in the right upper quadrant, and a third was placed in the left lower quadrant. At laparoscopy, there was no evidence of disease recurrence. Placement of the patient in a steep trendelenburg position facilitated division of adhesions with mobilisation of the small bowel loops out of the hernial defect . Both ureters were identified. The defect was repaired using a nonabsorbable composite mesh (Composix E/X Oval, 1 8 × 2 3  cms (Bard Nordic, Sweden) ellipse mesh, 7 × 9   ). The mesh was inserted through the 12 mm optical port and tacked anteriorly to the symphysis pubis and pelvic brim using a stapler device (StatTack, Autosuture, Tyco Healthcare UK Ltd). It was anchored to the sacrum using the endotacker. The remaining mesh was laparoscopically sutured to the surrounding pelvic brim and lateral abdominal wall, taking great care to avoid the ureters, iliac vessels and inferior epigastric vessels, using interrupted 3/0 vicryl sutures (Ethicon.Inc).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Intra-abdominal view of bowel loops mobilised from perineal wall defect. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged 2 days later. Following repair, the patient remained asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence of the perineal hernia  at 18-month followup.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Five months postoperative perineal hernia repair with no evidence of recurrence. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Perineal hernias may be classified as primary (congenital or acquired) or secondary (postoperative). They are infrequent complications of major pelvic surgery and when present are usually asymptomatic. Aboian et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> recently showed in a retrospective study a prevalence rate of symptomatic postoperative perineal hernias of 0.34% with a more common prevalence associated with those who have had cancer operations. Smoking, female gender, and chemoradiotherapy are other important risk factors. The duration between surgery and hernia formation is usually between six months and five years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The patient described in this case report had many of these risk factors including a rectal tumour, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and smoking.\n\n【16】Surgical repair of a postoperative perineal hernia is indicated if there is pain or discomfort, skin erosion over the herniated sac, or intestinal obstruction and involves mobilisation and reduction of the contents of the hernial sac with closure of the defect. Many techniques have been reported including transperineal, transabdominal and the combined abdominoperineal approach. Given the low prevalence of such hernias there is, however, no consensus as to which approach is best. Aboian et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> in their review suggest that the abdominal approach has advantages that confer superiority over the transperineal option, with better exposure for dissecting out sac contents, hernial boundaries and pelvic contours. In addition, it also provides good access for mesh positioning and allows for exclusion of small bowel from the repair. Despite the increase use of laparoscopy as a surgical technique, to date there have been few reports of its application to repair of postoperative perineal hernias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Laparoscopy has the advantage of quicker recovery time, faster recovery of bowel function, and decreased immunological stress while offering the same advantages as open abdominal surgery including good visualisation of intra-abdominal contents and the ability to survey for evidence of tumour recurrence intraoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In support of this, our results using laparoscopic repair demonstrate that it is an excellent alternative to other surgical repair techniques with good early postoperative outcomes.\n\n【17】Various techniques to repair the defect in the pelvic floor have previously been used. These include synthetic mesh repair, omentoplasty, musculocutaneous rotation flaps, and free facia lata flaps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Nonabsorbable meshes, such as that used in this case report, are increasingly being used to provide a new pelvic floor in cases of large defects. The composite mesh which has a hydrophilic film reduces the risk of visceral adhesions while the nonresorbable polyester mesh provides long-term reinforcement of soft tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Again, we have demonstrated good early results with the use of this mesh but further long-term followup is warranted.\n\n【18】In conclusion, symptomatic perineal hernias, which are rare complications of pelvic surgery, require surgical repair. Many approaches have previously been described. We have demonstrated that the use of laparoscopy with repair of the pelvic floor defect using nonabsorbable synthetic meshes offers an excellent alternative with many potential advantages over open transabdominal and transperineal repairs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:44", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:53", "cost": 8.465}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:43"}

Maternal antibodies of IgG class can cross the placenta to result in alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. Antibodies to human neutrophil antigens anti-HNA-1a, HNA-1b, and HNA-2a have been most commonly reported to cause alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. Isoantibodies to Fc gamma RIIIb (CD16) if mother is a HNA-null phenotype are rarely involved in neonatal neutropenia. We report on a case of severe neutropenia (440 neutrophils/ L) due to anti-Fc gamma RIIIb (CD16) isoimmunization. On day 14 severe omphalitis developed, which was treated for 7 days by an antibiotic (ceftriaxone in a dose of 80 mg/kg/d) according to umbilical swab finding. Omphalitis persisted for 10 days in spite of antibiotic therapy and only resolved upon the introduction of rhG-CSF therapy. Therapy with rh-GCSF proved efficient and led to neutrophil count increase to 1970/ L and cure of omphalitis. However, therapeutic effect on granulocyte count was of transient nature, as granulocyte count fell to 760 n/ L on day 4 of therapy discontinuation. Neutropenia persisted for 2 months.

Mother had a normal neutrophil count. First borne child was healthy. Mother’s sister is of the same HNA-1-null genotype, delivered two healthy children.\n\n【13】Severe neutropenia (440 neutrophils/ L) with normal findings of other laboratory tests was detected on the first day of the newborn's life.\n\n【14】On day 14 severe omphalitis developed, which was treated for 7 days by an antibiotic (ceftriaxone in a dose of 80 mg/kg/d) according to umbilical swab finding.\n\n【15】Upon making the diagnosis of neonatal isoimmune neutropenia due to anti-Fc gamma RIIIIb (CD16) pan-reactive antibodies, therapy with rh-GCSF from day 19 to day 23 (Neupogen in a dose of 5  g/kg/d) was introduced . Therapy with rh-GCSF proved efficient and led to neutrophil count increase to 1970/ L and cure of omphalitis.

Discussion\n\n【27】We report on a case of severe neonatal neutropenia due to anti-Fc gamma RIIIb (CD16) isommunization in the child born from the second uneventful pregnancy to healthy mother.\n\n【28】Several cases of immune neonatal neutropenia caused by anti-Fc gamma RIIIb isoantibodies have been described in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 16–19\\]</u>. Fromont et al. report on the presence of iso-anti-CD-16 antibodies in one of five individuals with Fc gamma RIIIb deficiency (three of them pregnant women), all of them being healthy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Haas et al. analyzed history data of 21 donors with Fc gamma RIIIb deficiency identified in 14 unrelated families. Recurrent bacterial infections were recorded in 3/21 subjects, whereas others had never had any serious bacterial infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【29】In the case presented, a severe form of omphalitis was observed on postnatal day 14 and persisted for 10 days of antibiotic therapy introduction, as indicated by the antibiotic sensitivity report followed by rhG-CSF therapy. Omphalitis persisted in spite of antibiotic therapy and only resolved upon the introduction of rhG-CSF therapy.\n\n【30】The issue of the choice and efficacy of specific therapy to increase the blood neutrophil count in the management of ANN is not fully defined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The effect of prophylactic antibiotic therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rh-GCSF) is variable and may prove useful in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>.\n\n【31】According to literature data, clinical experience with rh-GCSF use is highly favourable but mostly referring to the management of neutropenia following bone marrow and stem cell transplantation neonatal sepsis and autoimmune neutropenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 23\\]</u>. Experience with rh-GCSF in the treatment of ANN is quite limited, and the effect of rh-GCSF on developing tissues of the neonate is unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>. In the majority of ANN cases, the use of rh-GCSF resulted in a very rapid and steady neutrophil count increase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【32】In our patient, therapy with rh-GCSF proved efficient and led to an increase in neutrophil count and resolution of omphalitis.

Therapy was indicated due to persistent and progressive symptoms of encephalopathy. Although an open surgical approach was considered, the multidisciplinary liver tumor group elected an initial percutaneous interventional approach. The procedure was performed with intravenous moderate sedation and local anesthesia. The left branch of the portal vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle from an anterior abdominal approach, under real time US guidance. After placement of a 10 cm 5 Fr vascular sheath, a 4 Fr Bernstein catheter (Cook, Inc. Bloomington, IL) was directed into the main portal vein over a 0.035-inch angled glide-wire (Terumo Medical Corp. Somerset, NJ). Portal venography demonstrated two large right portal anterior and posterior venous branches communicating with the right hepatic veins through aneurysmal connections . There was a 28 mm aneurysm associated with the anterior portohepatic venous shunt  and a 37 mm aneurysm associated with posterior portohepatic shunt . Over a 0.035-inch Rosen wire, the 10 cm sheath was exchanged for a 25 cm 5 Fr sheath. The 4 Fr Bernstein catheter was advanced over the 0.035-inch angled glide-wire into the anterior right portal vein branch to its communication with the right hepatic vein. A 6 mm Amplatzer II vascular plug (St Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) was used to occlude the right anterior portal vein proximal to the communication with the right hepatic vein. The 4 Fr Bernstein catheter was then directed to the posterior right portal vein branch that supplied the second shunt. A 12 mm Amplatzer vascular plug was placed to occlude the posterior right portal vein branch. After occlusion of anterior and posterior right portal vein branches, a portal venogram was obtained with catheter tip in the main portal vein, which confirmed an absence of flow in the occluded branches with no opacification of the aneurysms . The hepatic parenchymal access tract was embolized with gelfoam pledgets.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 A 45-year-old female with intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt with associated aneurysms.

Her moderate postprocedure RUQ pain was managed with intravenous hydromorphone. There was improvement of her RUQ pain and swelling at one-week postprocedure follow-up. US and Doppler assessment of the liver performed one month after embolization demonstrated thrombosis of the portohepatic communications and associated aneurysms. The patient had complete resolution of the presenting symptoms and was asymptomatic at 6-month follow-up.\n\n【14】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Stringer described four major different varieties of congenital portosystemic venous shunts in six children seen during a 10-year period, with reference to anatomy of the shunt which was determined by imaging studies and surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. He divided extrahepatic portocaval shunts into two types: first, end-to-side shunts, where the portal vein (PV) terminates in the inferior vena cava (IVC), and the second, side-to-side shunts in which there is venous communication between a patent PV and the IVC. The third and fourth types of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts were abnormal intrahepatic connections between branches of the PV and the hepatic veins or IVC and persistent patent ductus venosus.\n\n【16】An intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt (IPSVS) is a communication between an intrahepatic portal vein and a systemic vein via an anomalous intrahepatic venous channel. The etiology of IPSVS may be congenital or acquired (secondary to cirrhosis, trauma, or biopsy procedure). The intrahepatic portal venous shunt in adults is most commonly due to portal venous communication to a systemic vein secondary to portal hypertension. While portosystemic shunts less than 2 mm in diameter are relatively common in patients with cirrhosis, the larger shunts are thought to be congenital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Popper et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> described many minute communications between the portal and hepatic veins in cirrhotic livers. These anastomoses were considered to be remnants of previous sinusoids that had dilated and whose walls had become thickened in areas of liver cell loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our case is likely to be congenital as these were relatively large communications and there was no associated evidence of chronic liver disease or prior history of trauma to the liver.\n\n【17】In the embryonic period, there are three pairs of veins that participate in the formation of venous structures within and around the liver: right and left vitelline veins, umbilical veins, and cardinal veins. The portal vein is formed from several segments of the vitelline veins while some segments of the right and left vitelline veins collapse and disappear during the process of development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. According to Raskin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> “a persistence of portions of the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) venous system from the second month of fetal life is the most likely explanation for the portohepatic venous malformation.”\n\n【18】Some small intrahepatic portosystemic shunts  located between the portal branches and hepatic veins disappear spontaneously by age 1 to 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. If larger shunts or the ductus venosus persists, they pose a risk of late development of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, pulmonary hypertension, or hyperammonemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6, 7\\]</u>. The clinical significance of IPSVS depends upon the shunt ratio and on the patient’s age. Decreasing tolerance of the brain to toxic metabolites with increasing age may explain the delayed clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts.</u>\n\n【20】Two shunts in one patient are also relatively rare. Remer et al. found three out of twenty-two (13.6%) had two intrahepatic portal venous shunts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The incidence of portal vein aneurysm in association with portosystemic shunts is not uniform in the literature. Tanoue et al. found that portal vein aneurysms were reported in 5 (50%) of 10 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Color Doppler ultrasonography (US) is the key imaging modality for the diagnosis of congenital portosystemic shunt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Doppler US is also useful for follow-up after therapy. In addition to demonstrating flow signals between the involved vessels, and evaluating flow direction, it may also determine the shunt ratio by estimating flow volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. The shunt ratio is calculated by dividing the blood flow volume through the shunt by the total portal blood flow volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 14\\]</u>. When the shunt ratio increases, the amount of nitrogen-containing substances in the portal blood that bypass the hepatic metabolism rises in the systemic circulation and can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. When the shunt ratio exceeds 30%, hepatic encephalopathy may develop at any time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. When the shunt ratio exceeds 60%, the risk of hepatic encephalopathy is increased, such that, in noncirrhotic patients even without encephalopathy, therapeutic intervention is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Multidetector computed tomography (CT) with contrast is useful for pretreatment planning, to document the anatomy and location of the shunt. With use of maximum intensity projection and multiplanar reconstruction, it provides all the necessary information about the course of the shunt, its size, and orientation; it helps to define the best access route for intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. MRI with contrast of the abdomen can also well visualize the shunt anatomy without radiation risk. Confirmation with CT or MRI is valuable when there is suboptimal sonographic visualization of the liver and can exclude associated abnormalities such as liver tumors.\n\n【23】Recently, Lautz et al. classified shunts based on portal anatomy and expected physiologic consequences of the shunt , regardless of whether they were intrahepatic or extrahepatic; type I shunts were those with no intrahepatic portal flow and type II shunts were partial shunts with some preserved intrahepatic flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Type II shunt was further classified based on portal anatomy; type IIa arises from a portal branch, type IIb is from the main portal vein, its bifurcation, or the splenomesenteric confluence, and type IIc includes shunts from mesenteric veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Classification of congenital PSVS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. CAPV indicates congenital absence of the portal vein.</u>\n\n【25】Other vascular abnormalities of the liver such as cavernous transformation of the portal vein, arterioportal shunts, and aneurysm of the portal vein are in the differential diagnosis. These can be differentiated from IPSVS by imaging findings. Cavernous transformation of the portal vein is due to the formation of venous channels within and around a previously stenosed or occluded portal vein that act as portoportal collateral channels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. A characteristic beaded appearance (mass of veins) at the porta hepatis is usually seen on contrast enhanced CT scans due to dilated biliary and gastric veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18–20\\]</u>. Arterioportal shunts are due to communication between the hepatic artery and the portal venous system. This condition is diagnosed in helical CT performed during the hepatic arterial phase showing early and marked enhancement of the main portal vein or major tributaries with attenuation similar to that of the aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Aneurysms of the portal venous system may be present in patients with liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. On contrast enhanced CT or MRI, an aneurysm appears as an enhancing cystic mass that arises from the portal venous system and demonstrates simultaneous enhancement with portal vein.\n\n【26】Invasive studies such as arterial portography or direct percutaneous transhepatic portography can confirm the presence of portosystemic shunts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Symptomatic portosystemic shunts warrant therapeutic intervention. Treatment options include percutaneous embolization or surgical shunt ligation and/or hepatic resection. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment of congenital absence of the portal vein (type I Abernethy malformation) and is reserved for patients with refractory symptoms despite medical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 18\\]</u>. Type II PSVS has variable anatomy, clinical features, and treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Lautz et al. reported 10 symptomatic children with type II PSVS who were successfully managed with operative ligation , endovascular occlusion , and a combined approach . Endovascular occlusion (using coils, plugs, and/or stents) has proven successful for patent ductus venosus (PDV) and other isolated type IIa shunts whereas type IIb shunt usually requires staged operative closure because of short and wide diameter of the shunt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Type IIc can be managed either with surgical ligation or endovascular occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Percutaneous closure of the shunts can be performed when an occlusive device can be fixed in position in the shunt, without compromising the flow in the inferior vena cava and the normal hepatic veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. This endovascular therapeutic option applies to shunts between portal branches and hepatic veins that can be closed by means of Amplatzer occlusive devices or embolic metallic coils, which depends on the size, position, and number of communications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Advantages of percutaneous embolization are the less invasive procedure and preservation of hepatic parenchyma. This is particularly important when faced with a lesion in the setting of cirrhosis and portal hypertension where preservation of hepatic parenchyma is desired 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【27】After closure of the shunt, liver tests and coagulation studies should return to normal. Hyperammonemia usually normalizes within a day and serum bile acids should be normal after a few days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 22\\]</u>. Sustained clinical follow-up is necessary to exclude return of symptoms that are secondary to recanalization of an occluded shunt or enlargement of other anomalous portosystemic communications.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】Congenital intrahepatic shunts between the portal and hepatic veins are rare vascular abnormalities that may cause hepatic encephalopathy. Abdominal sonography with color Doppler is an excellent method to identify these lesions. Confirmation with CT or MRI is valuable when there is suboptimal sonographic visualization of the liver, to identify associated abnormalities, and for treatment planning. This pathologic condition can be successfully treated with percutaneous interventional occlusive techniques or surgical closure.\n\n【30】#### Abbreviations\n\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| --- | --- |\n| CAPV: | Congenital absence of the portal vein |\n| Fr: | French scale commonly used to measure the size of a catheter |\n| IPSVS: | Intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt |\n| IVC: | Inferior vena cava |\n| PDV: | Patent ductus venosus |\n| PSVS: | Portosystemic venous shunt |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| RUQ: | Right upper quadrant. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": " Abbreviations\n\nCT:\tComputed tomography\nCAPV:\tCongenital absence of the portal vein\nFr:\tFrench scale commonly used to measure the size of a catheter\nIPSVS:\tIntrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt\nIVC:\tInferior vena cava\nPDV:\tPatent ductus venosus\nPSVS:\tPortosystemic venous shunt\nMRI:\tMagnetic resonance imaging\nRUQ:\tRight upper quadrant.", "content": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Intrahepatic shunts between the portal and systemic venous systems with associated aneurysms are extremely rare.

The incidence of portal vein aneurysm in association with portosystemic shunts is not uniform in the literature. Tanoue et al. found that portal vein aneurysms were reported in 5 (50%) of 10 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Color Doppler ultrasonography (US) is the key imaging modality for the diagnosis of congenital portosystemic shunt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Doppler US is also useful for follow-up after therapy. In addition to demonstrating flow signals between the involved vessels, and evaluating flow direction, it may also determine the shunt ratio by estimating flow volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. The shunt ratio is calculated by dividing the blood flow volume through the shunt by the total portal blood flow volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 14\\]</u>. When the shunt ratio increases, the amount of nitrogen-containing substances in the portal blood that bypass the hepatic metabolism rises in the systemic circulation and can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. When the shunt ratio exceeds 30%, hepatic encephalopathy may develop at any time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. When the shunt ratio exceeds 60%, the risk of hepatic encephalopathy is increased, such that, in noncirrhotic patients even without encephalopathy, therapeutic intervention is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Multidetector computed tomography (CT) with contrast is useful for pretreatment planning, to document the anatomy and location of the shunt. With use of maximum intensity projection and multiplanar reconstruction, it provides all the necessary information about the course of the shunt, its size, and orientation; it helps to define the best access route for intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. MRI with contrast of the abdomen can also well visualize the shunt anatomy without radiation risk. Confirmation with CT or MRI is valuable when there is suboptimal sonographic visualization of the liver and can exclude associated abnormalities such as liver tumors.\n\n【23】Recently, Lautz et al. classified shunts based on portal anatomy and expected physiologic consequences of the shunt , regardless of whether they were intrahepatic or extrahepatic; type I shunts were those with no intrahepatic portal flow and type II shunts were partial shunts with some preserved intrahepatic flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Type II shunt was further classified based on portal anatomy; type IIa arises from a portal branch, type IIb is from the main portal vein, its bifurcation, or the splenomesenteric confluence, and type IIc includes shunts from mesenteric veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Classification of congenital PSVS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. CAPV indicates congenital absence of the portal vein.</u>\n\n【25】Other vascular abnormalities of the liver such as cavernous transformation of the portal vein, arterioportal shunts, and aneurysm of the portal vein are in the differential diagnosis. These can be differentiated from IPSVS by imaging findings. Cavernous transformation of the portal vein is due to the formation of venous channels within and around a previously stenosed or occluded portal vein that act as portoportal collateral channels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. A characteristic beaded appearance (mass of veins) at the porta hepatis is usually seen on contrast enhanced CT scans due to dilated biliary and gastric veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18–20\\]</u>. Arterioportal shunts are due to communication between the hepatic artery and the portal venous system. This condition is diagnosed in helical CT performed during the hepatic arterial phase showing early and marked enhancement of the main portal vein or major tributaries with attenuation similar to that of the aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Aneurysms of the portal venous system may be present in patients with liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. On contrast enhanced CT or MRI, an aneurysm appears as an enhancing cystic mass that arises from the portal venous system and demonstrates simultaneous enhancement with portal vein.\n\n【26】Invasive studies such as arterial portography or direct percutaneous transhepatic portography can confirm the presence of portosystemic shunts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Symptomatic portosystemic shunts warrant therapeutic intervention. Treatment options include percutaneous embolization or surgical shunt ligation and/or hepatic resection. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment of congenital absence of the portal vein (type I Abernethy malformation) and is reserved for patients with refractory symptoms despite medical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 18\\]</u>. Type II PSVS has variable anatomy, clinical features, and treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Lautz et al. reported 10 symptomatic children with type II PSVS who were successfully managed with operative ligation , endovascular occlusion , and a combined approach . Endovascular occlusion (using coils, plugs, and/or stents) has proven successful for patent ductus venosus (PDV) and other isolated type IIa shunts whereas type IIb shunt usually requires staged operative closure because of short and wide diameter of the shunt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Type IIc can be managed either with surgical ligation or endovascular occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Percutaneous closure of the shunts can be performed when an occlusive device can be fixed in position in the shunt, without compromising the flow in the inferior vena cava and the normal hepatic veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. This endovascular therapeutic option applies to shunts between portal branches and hepatic veins that can be closed by means of Amplatzer occlusive devices or embolic metallic coils, which depends on the size, position, and number of communications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Advantages of percutaneous embolization are the less invasive procedure and preservation of hepatic parenchyma. This is particularly important when faced with a lesion in the setting of cirrhosis and portal hypertension where preservation of hepatic parenchyma is desired 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【27】After closure of the shunt, liver tests and coagulation studies should return to normal. Hyperammonemia usually normalizes within a day and serum bile acids should be normal after a few days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 22\\]</u>. Sustained clinical follow-up is necessary to exclude return of symptoms that are secondary to recanalization of an occluded shunt or enlargement of other anomalous portosystemic communications.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】Congenital intrahepatic shunts between the portal and hepatic veins are rare vascular abnormalities that may cause hepatic encephalopathy. Abdominal sonography with color Doppler is an excellent method to identify these lesions. Confirmation with CT or MRI is valuable when there is suboptimal sonographic visualization of the liver, to identify associated abnormalities, and for treatment planning. This pathologic condition can be successfully treated with percutaneous interventional occlusive techniques or surgical closure.\n\n【30】#### Abbreviations\n\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| --- | --- |\n| CAPV: | Congenital absence of the portal vein |\n| Fr: | French scale commonly used to measure the size of a catheter |\n| IPSVS: | Intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt |\n| IVC: | Inferior vena cava |\n| PDV: | Patent ductus venosus |\n| PSVS: | Portosystemic venous shunt |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| RUQ: | Right upper quadrant. |", "index": 18467, "show": true, "start": 18467, "end": 18805, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:50:31", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:50:50", "cost": 18.461}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:50:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:50:29"}

To better illustrate the potential relationship between different eosinophilic immune dysfunctions and the effects of biological therapies in this scenario, here, we present a case of a 63-year-old male first referred to our department in 2018 with a diagnosis of asthma, polyposis, and rhinosinusitis and presenting a suspicion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs’ allergy. He also had a past medical history of eosinophilic gastroenteritis/duodenitis (eosinophilia counts >50 cells/high-power field HPF). The use of multiple courses of corticosteroid therapy failed to completely control these conditions. In October 2019, after starting benralizumab (an antibody directed against the alpha chain of the IL-5 cytokine receptor) as add-on treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma, important clinical improvements were reported both on the respiratory (no asthma exacerbations) and gastrointestinal systems (eosinophilia count 0 cells/HPF). Patients’ quality of life also increased. Since June 2020, systemic corticosteroid therapy was reduced without worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms or eosinophilic inflammation. This case warns of the importance of early recognition and appropriate individualized treatment of eosinophilic immune dysfunctions and suggests the conduction of further larger studies on the use of benralizumab in gastrointestinal syndromes aiming at better understanding its relying mechanisms of action in the intestinal mucosa.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Eosinophils are innate immune multifunctional leukocytes that participate in diverse inflammatory pathways, modulate innate and adaptive immune responses and act as effector cells producing tissue-destructive cationic proteins, cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators. These cells are associated with host defense against parasitic viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. However, recent studies demonstrated that eosinophils also play a primary pathophysiologic role in the so-called eosinophil-associated disorders (EADs), a wide variety of conditions including rhinitis, eosinophilic asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, dermatitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】These disorders have been historically treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, which are often effective at reducing eosinophil counts and associated eosinophilic inflammation but are also associated with serious long-term adverse events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. After 2005-2006, advances in the development of new treatments led to the approval of biological therapies, whose overall mechanism of action targets selective eosinophilopoietic cytokines or other cells interacting with or activating inflammatory pathways. Benralizumab, an antibody directed against the alpha chain of the IL-5 cytokine receptor (IL-5RA), was approved as add-on treatment for moderate to severe eosinophilic asthma grounded on the results of multicenter randomized clinical trials showing significant asthma control improvement and exacerbations reductions (moderate-high certainty of evidence) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. More recently, studies have suggested a potential additional effect of benralizumab for depleting both blood and gastrointestinal tissue eosinophilia in some patients with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID), which may lead to a novel clinical indication for the use of this therapy. Nonetheless, the clinical response among patients using biologics seems heterogeneous, and the possible causative link between this EAD and immunotherapy is not completely known, which requires further investigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>. These are especially important given the unmet need in this field for targeted therapies that can normalize the immune response to triggers, reduce chronic inflammation, and limit or prevent remodeling and tissue fibrosis. Currently, conventional treatment of EGID includes diet, proton pump inhibitors, and corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【5】In this context, we aimed to briefly review the literature on the multiple aspects of eosinophilic immune dysfunctions, focus on the potential association between asthma and EGID, and share the outcomes of a case of a male patient with gastrointestinal eosinophilic syndrome, for whom benralizumab has been indicated for managing severe asthma.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Literature Review\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Eosinophilic Immune Dysfunctions\n\n【8】Eosinophils, although representing only the second granulocyte subpopulation in the circulating blood (<6% of the bone marrow resident nucleated cells), are receiving a growing interest from the scientific community given their complex pathophysiological role in immune homeostasis both as effector immune cells committed to the host defense and as modulators of innate and adaptive immune responses. The most relevant mechanisms of actions are the axis between eosinophils and T-cells, more specifically T helper type 2 (Th2) cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Th2 cells can stimulate eosinophils either directly through the release of interleukin-5 (IL5), or indirectly by promoting a humoral adaptive response with a particular production of IgE, leading to a cascade of events (e.g. a network of intracellular signaling pathways) in the main tissues in which eosinophils are recruited (i.e. digestive tract, adipose tissue, lung, mammary gland, thymus, and uterus) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Classically, eosinophils are associated with the combat of helminthic infections and induction of tissue damage in the context of allergies. However, a broad range of other local and systemic inflammatory diseases as well as cancer and thrombosis are being related to deranged eosinophil functions and unbalanced Th2-responses often associated with eosinophilia or eosinophil-mediated tissue damage which highlights the role of eosinophils as biomarkers. Eosinophilia refers to an absolute count of eosinophils exceeding 450–500 cells/𝜇l, while blood type eosinophilia is usually employed to define thresholds of 1500 cells/μl. In this context, eosinophilic immune dysfunctions or eosinophil-associated diseases/disorders (EADs) are being currently defined as a range of heterogeneous conditions in which eosinophils are believed to play a critical pathological role in self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle of diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. EADs include common illnesses such as eosinophil-related respiratory diseases (chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, and asthma) and skin diseases (dermatitis, cellulitis, urticaria, and severe drug reactions), and other rare conditions such as hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES, defined as association of blood hypereosinophilia with established eosinophil-related organ damage), hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance (HEUS, defined as clinically silent cases of hypereosinophilia), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID). Eosinophilia can also be observed in other immune-mediated diseases such as pemphigoid, systemic sclerosis, sarcoidosis, and IgG4-related diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【10】EADs are lifelong conditions requiring monitoring and associated with substantial burdens both for the patient and its family/caregivers (including chronic and debilitating symptoms, decreased health-related quality of life, and increased out-of-pocket costs for treatment) and for the healthcare system (need for multiple different healthcare professionals and increased emergency departments visits and hospital stays). In New Zealand, for instance, severe eosinophilic asthma patients present over 1.5 times as many respiratory treatment prescriptions and 3.6 higher asthma-related healthcare costs compared to other patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In the United Kingdom, although the prevalence of severe, uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma is low (1%), the associated health-related costs are four times greater (cost ratio 3.9 (95% IC 3.7–4.1)) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Moreover, healthcare resource utilization may be particularly high in EGID, with contributing factors including diagnostic delays (poor disease recognition), repeated endoscopy, and lack of approved medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 17, 18\\]</u>. The median total annual cost of a single eosinophilic esophagitis case in the United States was estimated at USD $3,300 (outpatient visits, pharmacy, and endoscopy); the total health utilization costs per year vary between $350 and 950 million 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19–22\\]</u>.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Linking EGIDs and Allergic Diseases\n\n【12】EGIDs are an umbrella term referring to primary eosinophilic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract encompassing a spectrum of diseases characterized by prominent eosinophilic inflammation affecting different regions of the gut (i.e. esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and colon or a combination) that occur in the absence of secondary causes (e.g. infections and drug reactions) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. The strong association of EGID with allergic disorders such as asthma, dermatitis, rhinitis, and food or drug allergies has been recently recognized, and although their shared pathophysiological basis remains partly elusive (e.g. both are characterized by immunologically Th2 responses and allergic sensitizations), this feature may impact on accurate diagnostic and treatment of these conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 24\\]</u>. Moreover, very few mechanistic studies specifically examine both disorders when found concomitantly in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Most of the knowledge about the coexistence or relationship between EGIDs and asthma comes essentially from the eosinophilic esophagitis literature, probably because this is the most frequent form of EGIDs and because gastritis, enteritis, and gastroenteritis are usually considered as a whole nosologic entity given their clinical similarities. The prevalence of asthma in patients with esophagitis is estimated between 25% and 60%, while in eosinophilic gastritis or gastroenteritis cases it may reach 40%. Primary eosinophilic colitis is the least frequent disorder among EGID; asthma is reported in around 15% of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>. Recent meta-analyses (21 studies, n = 53,592 adult and pediatric patients) confirm that individuals with EGID have significantly increased probability of having asthma (OR 3.06 (95% IC 2.01–4.66)) when compared to controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27–30\\]</u>.\n\n【14】In this scenario, since asthma and EGID may share similar molecular pathophysiology, the possibility of using target therapies has emerged as a potential research area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【15】##### 2.3. Treatment Options\n\n【16】EADs are typically managed with topical or systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, which are initially effective in controlling eosinophilia and symptoms in many patients. However, chronic use of these therapies often leads to serious short-and long-term adverse effects and resistance, requiring second-line agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. For EGID, conventional treatments additionally include elimination diet, proton pump inhibitors, and esophageal dilation in patients who have developed strictures. Nonetheless, these treatments also demonstrate variable response rates and may not always provide long-term disease control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In the past decade, the knowledge of eosinophil biology has led to the development of several biologics targeting eosinophils. These therapies provide the advantage of targeting specific cells or pathways, theoretically increasing efficacy, and limiting complications related to nonspecific effects of more traditional therapeutic approaches. Early research and development efforts of these biologics focused on blocking the action of IL-5; yet, the number of agents approved and under development for managing EAD- especially asthma, has significantly increased in the last years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>. A review of the mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety of different biologicals to treat asthma (i.e. benralizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab, and reslizumab) grounded the development of clinical recommendations and practical guidelines in the field with moderate to high certainty. All these biologicals are able to reduce severe asthma exacerbations, improve asthma control, health-related quality of life, and FEV1, without reaching minimal important differences. They can also reduce the daily doses of oral corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31, 32\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Benralizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody of the isotype IgG1k immunoglobulin that specifically binds to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor expressed on eosinophils and basophils. This drug is approved since 2017 in the United States (Food and Drug Administration agency) and 2018 in Europe (European Medicines Agency) as a maintenance treatment for patients with severe asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype, grounded mostly on the clinical results from phase III pivotal multicenter randomized trials (SIROCCO, CALIMA, and ZONDA), which are also highlighted in several systematic review with meta-analyses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32–35\\]</u>. The usual dose is 30 mg SC every 4 weeks for 3 doses and then every 8 weeks. Other recent studies have also demonstrated potential benefits with the use of benralizumab for managing further respiratory-related EAD such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u> and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (at higher doses) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Table 1 depicts most of the ongoing clinical trials with benralizumab targeting several EADs other than asthma.\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Main ongoing clinical trials with benralizumab.</u>\n\n【20】Conversely, so far only the biologic dupilumab has been approved (May 2022) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agency to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older), grounded on the positive results of a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, and placebo-controlled trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. Other approvals of biological treatments for these EGID indications are scarce 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Some recently published case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u> demonstrated potential histological remission of gastrointestinal eosinophilia in patients under benralizumab for asthma. However, the clinical response over time seems heterogeneous and may rely on different factors (e.g. gastrointestinal segment affected), requiring further investigation and discussion on the matter.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Case Presentation\n\n【22】This study followed the standards for scientific research of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from the patient, and anonymity was guaranteed (the study followed the CARE checklist 2013-Supplementary material (Available here)). The overall timeline and major events are depicted in Figure 1.\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Timeline of the case report: patient journey and main outcomes.</u>\n\n【24】A 63-year-old male, with a diagnosis of asthma, polyposis, and rhinosinusitis was referred to our facility (Lisbon, Portugal) in 2018 due to suspicion of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) allergy and difficult to control asthma. The patient also had a past medical history of eosinophilic gastroenteritis confirmed by biopsy performed in 2006 (eosinophilic duodenitis) and later on in 2017 (gastric, duodenal, and colonic eosinophilic infiltrates).\n\n【25】According to the patient medical record, gastrointestinal symptoms began in 2000, when he started having sporadic abdominal pains that were relieved with proton pump inhibitors. At this time, he also had eosinophilia (1526 cell/μL), but due to clinical resolution on further investigation was performed. In 2006, the patient was admitted to the Gastroenterology Department due to refractory abdominal pain and postprandial infarction. He still had blood eosinophilia (672 cell/μL). Celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and infection were excluded; an upper endoscopy revealed the presence of eosinophilic duodenitis. The patient underwent a course of corticosteroid therapy and was discharged with symptom resolution. In 2009, ulcerative proctitis was assumed, and he was medicated with mesalamine with resolution of symptoms.\n\n【26】In the same year, the patient started exercise dyspnea-later confirmed in a metacholine bronchial provocation test. At that time, budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg daily was indicated (regimen maintained until 2018). Between 2015 and 2018, he complained about worsening asthma symptoms, specifically cough, dyspnea, and wheezing (with cold and with little physical effort). Currently eosinophil count: 520/μL.\n\n【27】In 2017, due to uncontrolled abdominal pain, the patient was again admitted to the Gastroenterology Department showing moderate blood eosinophilia (1500 cell/μL). The upper endoscopy and ileocolonoscopy, both revealed (off) esophageal, gastric, duodenal, ileal, and colonic eosinophilic inflammation with eosinophilic infiltrates (namely, >50/cell/high-power field (HPF) in the ileon and colon) besides endoscopic evidence of erosions and hyperemia in the ileocolonosocpy . Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis was excluded (negative p-ANCA and C-ANCA; normal ECG, echocardiogram, and normal thoracic CT-scan. Skin biopsy also showed no vasculitis); a diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis was reached.\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Comparison of endoscopic alterations in 2017 (a–c) and endoscopic healing in 2022 (d, e).

(e) Normal colonic mucosa in the transverse colon.</u>\n\n【29】In 2018, the patient was once referred to our department due to suspicious NERD (NSAID exacerbated respiratory disease) as he presented dyspnea while taking nimesulide, acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, and metamizole. As the patient was on systemic corticosteroid therapy, it was not possible to do NSAIDs provocation test; yet, clinical history was consistent, and the diagnosis of NERD was assumed. At this time, the blood eosinophil count was 210 cells/mcL (610 in April 2017), ACT (asthma control test) 19 points, CARAT 22 points, and mini-AQLQ (mini asthma quality of life test) 3.0 points. Inhaler technique and adhesion were reviewed, and the patient was prescribed budesonide/formoterol 320/9 μg twice daily, tiotropium bromide 2,5 μg twice in the morning, and montelukast 10 mg daily. The results from pulmonary tests 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u> were as follows: FEV1 3.35 L, 102%; after bronchodilatation 3.76 L, 115% > 12%; FEV1/FVC 62.37%; FVC 5.35 L; after bronchodilatation 5.24 L, <2%; TLC 8.26 L, 123%; ITGG 4,36 L (normal), raw (slightly increased, theoretical value for this patient ); normal diffusing capacity.\n\n【30】In 2019, it was assumed that the patient had severe eosinophilic asthma as the disease was not controlled despite adequate pharmacological therapy according to the GINA guidelines, therapeutic adherence, and correct inhalation technique. Simultaneously, the patient had worsening gastrointestinal symptoms with the need of using systemic steroids (prednisolone 20 to 40 mg daily). This scenario led to the introduction of benralizumab (October 2019) at conventional dosage (first three doses every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks). Sixteen weeks after the first benralizumab injection, clinical improvements in both asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms without asthma exacerbation were noted. No adverse reactions were reported. Improvement in asthma scores (ACT 23 points; CARAT 23 points; mini-AQLQ 4.7 points) and a reduction in blood eosinophil count (to 0 cells/μL) were evident. Additionally, since June 2020, it was possible to reduce systemic corticosteroids to 5 mg per day without worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms. In November 2021, no self-reports of both asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded (blood eosinophil count 0 cells/μL).\n\n【31】Recently, in March 2022, the patient performed a routine upper endoscopy and ileocolonoscopy that still shows no eosinophilic inflammation . He is currently prescribed with benralizumab 30 mg each 8 weeks, montelukast 10 mg, rabeprazole 20 mg, budesonide/formoterol 160/2.5 μg daily, topical nasal budesonide 100 μg daily, and prednisolone 5 mg. No complains of respiratory nor gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded; quality of life has improved (ACT 24 points; CARAT 24 points; mini-AQLQ 6.6). The measuring of exhalated nitric oxide did not show eosinophilic inflammation (19 ppb). Since benralizumab initiation, no hospital admissions were reported. The results from pulmonary tests, under maintenance therapy 通用删除7(英):<u>(2022)</u>, were as follows: FEV1 3.56 L, 114%; after bronchodilatation 3.95 L > 11%; FEV/FVC 64.12%; FVC 5.44 L, 137% -after bronchodilatation 5.72 L > 5%; TLC 7.76 L; 115% .\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Changes in clinical parameters during the patient follow-up 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019–2022)</u>.</u>\n\n【33】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【34】This case and updated literature review warn of the diverse organ manifestations of Th2 inflammation and the potential associations between asthma and EGID, whose pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet completely elucidated. Our findings additionally suggest that target therapies such as benralizumab may have an important role in treating different eosinophilic conditions.\n\n【35】Recognition and appropriate treatment of EGID complications (i.e. symptoms, disease activity, continuous monitoring, and maintenance treatment) by means of a multidisciplinary approach are currently of utmost importance to improve clinical outcomes and patients’ quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Similarly, international asthma guidelines also recommend regular assessment and target treatment of comorbidity conditions such as allergic rhinitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and sinusitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Eosinophilic esophagitis, for instance, has been often associated with allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. It is plausible that similar mechanisms exist for EGID to affect asthma given the pulmonary-esophageal relationship in airway disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Although ideal biomarkers are still currently needed to better characterize asthma phenotypes, it is also important to recognize blood eosinophil count and its proportion with blood neutrophils and lymphocytes as the most reliable measures to predict airway eosinophilia in severe asthma and, therefore, the response to traditional treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and biologic drugs. In this context, the development, validation, and implementation of further point-of-care devices for the management of these conditions in clinical practice are recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Moreover, translational research has identified potential pathways to target in the treatment of EGID, including Th2 inflammation-targeted systemic pathways, mast cells, and eosinophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Preliminary studies reported that cendakimab (IL-13) affect eosinophil count and patients’ symptoms. The IL-5-targeting agents mepolizumab and reslizumab, commonly prescribed for severe eosinophilic asthma, showed histologic improvements in eosinophilic esophagitis (e.g. reduction in eosinophils), but failed to induce symptomatic improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42, 43\\]</u>. The results of a phase 2 trial using lirentelimab (a monoclonal antibody targeting the eosinophil and mast cell transmembrane protein Siglec8) demonstrated a slightly dysphagia improvement in a subset of patients with eosinophilic gastritis or duodenitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Yet, these studies were only powered to assess changes in eosinophil counts rather than any clinical outcomes. Only recently 通用删除7(英):<u>(2022)</u> dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, was approved by the FDA as first target treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis given the improved histologic remission (rates of around 60% when administered weekly vs. 5% in placebo; ) and alleviated symptoms of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. In this context as novel therapies and clinical indications or drug repurposing begin to emerge 通用删除1(英):<u>(i.e. see Table 1 for ongoing clinical trials on the use of benralizumab)</u>, there is a growing need for the full characterization and standardization of outcomes to better understand treatment responses and to facilitate the optimization and personalization of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Nonetheless, different patients may present different responses to treatment. A recent study reported that benralizumab led to histological remission of eosinophilic esophagitis in a 56-year-old patient with severe asthma. Conversely, complete clinical remission was not observed, which exemplified the complex nature of EGID, its associated psychosomatic burden, and the chronification of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A case series of n = 7 patients with eosinophilic GI disorders (n = 7 of them (71.4%) carrying a diagnosis of asthma) also demonstrated that benralizumab completely depleted blood and GI tissue eosinophilia. However, the clinical response, while encouraging, was heterogeneous. Potential explanations for this variability include a lag between eosinophil depletion and normalization of the mucosa and the involvement of other cells, such as epithelial cells or mast cells, in the pathogenesis of symptoms. Residual symptoms in some patients may reflect persistent epithelial changes in the upper GI tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our case, the use of benralizumab also led to a significant and objective reduction of eosinophilia in peripheral blood samples as well as in the histological examination, with zero eosinophilic granulocytes (0/high power field). More importantly, we noted a reduction in patients’ GI complaints/symptoms and hospital admission after treatment initiation, which may be associated with better clinical outcomes and increased quality of life for the patient and his family/caregivers and a reduced burden for the health system.\n\n【39】It is also important to highlight that no significant adverse events or drug discontinuation were related to benralizumab in this case report. In fact, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that this drug has a low risk of overall adverse events (most commonly reported: headache and pyrexia), serious adverse events, asthma exacerbation, bronchitis, and sinusitis, being relatively safe in both short-and long-term treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. Moreover, recent real-world studies on the management of eosinophilic lung diseases confirmed that add-on biological therapy with benralizumab leads to market improvement of severe eosinophilic asthma (including asthma exacerbation rates, prednisone intake, asthma control test, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, quality of life, and eosinophils count) both in patients with and without comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and at no significant safety issues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45, 46\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Yet, one should be aware that the current approved dose for benralizumab (i.e. as add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-actingβ\\-agonists) is 30 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses and then every 8 weeks thereafter. An adjusted dose targeting EGID treatment should be further investigated as it may influence pharmacokinetics/dynamics and outcome achievement. Although a potential synergism between corticosteroids and benralizumab may exist, a recent study indicates that benralizumab causes rapid and near complete depletion of blood eosinophils in the first 24 hours after treatment with a speed of onset effect very similar to that seen with oral prednisolone (time for blood eosinophil level to decrease 50% from baseline was of 1.7 hours (0.7) for benralizumab vs. 2.5 hours (0.3) for prednisolone; ). Authors suggest that benralizumab may be an alternative noncorticosteroid treatment for acute exacerbations of eosinophilic asthma with the potential benefit of inhibiting eosinophilic airway inflammation for at least 30 days after one injection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>. In our case, it was possible to reduce patients’ systemic corticosteroids to 5 mg per day, without worsening of GI symptoms and within six months after benralizumab initiation.\n\n【41】Our findings contribute to the emerging body of data suggesting the need for further studies with a larger number of patients with past clinical history of GI syndrome on benralizumab therapy aiming at better understanding its relying mechanisms of action in the intestinal mucosa and the potential benefits for immune disorders. Given the complexity and potential heterogeneity of EGID (e.g. discordance between symptoms, histology, and endoscopic features), there is a need for comprehensive treat-to-target goals, individualized therapy, and continuous monitoring of treatment response.\n\n【42】This study has some limitations. Although a systematic literature review would be methodologically more robust to cover the topic of asthma and EGID conditions, we demonstrated through a narrative review that the literature is still scarce. Our discussion is grounded on the results of a case reported in our center; however, other cases may have slightly different outcomes and thus should be interpreted within their clinical contexts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:48", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:07", "cost": 19.508}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:45"}

Chiari malformations (CM), first described approximately a hundred years ago, refer to a spectrum of hindbrain malformations characterized by cerebellar herniation through the foramen magnum. We present the case of a 28-year-old woman with ADHD and concurrent Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) that was diagnosed by CT scan. There is growing evidence supporting the role of the cerebellum and its associated structures in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Thus, a cerebellar malformation such as CM may impact neurological circuitry in a manner favoring the development of a neuropsychiatric disorder such as ADHD. Our case highlights the need for further studies pertaining to the role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of ADHD and the importance of considering the presence of CM when evaluating a patient with ADHD.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Reported prevalence rates of ADHD vary in the literature. Causes for these differences include factors such as the population studied and the method of assessment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. ADHD is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder, affecting approximately 9% of children and 4% of adults in the United States, that emerges during childhood and persists into adulthood in as many as 75% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. Despite recent advances in describing its precise pathophysiological mechanisms, much remains to be elucidated. Clinical observations of conditions which accompany and potentially contribute to ADHD may enhance our comprehension of this disorder.\n\n【4】Chiari malformations (CM), first described approximately a hundred years ago, refer to a spectrum of hindbrain malformations characterized by cerebellar herniation through the foramen magnum, resulting in compression of the caudal brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord as well as obstruction of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the fourth ventricle. Possible CM aetiologies include genetic predisposition, congenital anomalies, and acquisition through trauma or illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Four types of CM (CM-I, CM-II, CM-III, and CM-IV) have been described and are classified according to cerebellar herniation, spinal cord spacing, and severity, with CM-I being the least severe form 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The symptoms most commonly encountered in CM-I are debilitating headaches that worsen with Valsalva maneuvers, neck pain, dizziness, and visual disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is difficult to evaluate the true prevalence of CM; however, modern imaging techniques have enabled CM to be identified more frequently. Before these technologies were available CM, was evaluated to occur in .001% of births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The case we describe here is one of only three reported individual cases described in the English literature of a co-occurrence of ADHD and CM-I.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】The patient is a 28-year-old Caucasian college student, who was referred by her primary care practitioner to our outpatient clinic in September 2018 for evaluation and treatment of ADHD.\n\n【8】She had been diagnosed with ADHD at age 12 by a pediatrician and a psychologist in the context of poor academic performance, concentration difficulties, attention deficits, distractibility, impulsivity, and lack of organizational skills. At that time, the patient almost failed her first year of high school and began a trial of psychostimulants. By age 28, she had tried several long-acting formulations of methylphenidate as well as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, all of which increased her anxiety in social gatherings and resulted in significant dysphoria. At the time of her consultation, she was not on any medication.\n\n【9】She had no pertinent medical or surgical history, except for a concussion at age 15. Her mother had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and her brother with borderline personality disorder.\n\n【10】One month prior to her consultation, the patient experienced a significant concussion accompanied by migraines, nausea, vomiting, and ataxia. An emergency physician prescribed a cerebral CT scan. While the results excluded hemorrhage, ischemia, or space-occupying lesions, they indicated a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils compatible with CM type I.\n\n【11】At the time of presentation to our clinic, most of her symptoms of concussion had subsided with the exception of dizziness during physical exercise. The patient was mainly preoccupied with symptoms of ADHD, which were evaluated with the clinical interview and the adult ADHD self-report scale (ASRS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Our consultation confirmed a postconcussion syndrome and ADHD. The patient’s baseline ASRS score (before starting medication) was 62. She was concerned that her lifelong symptoms of ADHD may have been caused by the CM leading us to undertake a review of the literature.\n\n【12】In the months following her initial evaluation, the patient proved to be extremely sensitive to the side effects of stimulants, limiting the possibility of using the usual therapeutic dose range. She is currently stabilized on 10 mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate daily. At this dose, her ASRS score was 51. She notes some improvement in organisation but continues to have significant difficulties with concentration and impulsivity as of July 2019.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Our case report of co-occurring ADHD and CM-I is one of only three cases described in the English literature. One other case occurred in a 10-year-old male who exhibited autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, and CM-I, and the third occurred in a 10-year-old male with a nonsense hemizygous mutation of the TBL1X gene, central congenital hypothyroidism, hearing loss, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), encopresis, and CM-I 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. These reports are of interest as they support evidence pertaining to the role of the cerebellum, its genetics, and its associated structures in the pathophysiology of ADHD.\n\n【15】CM consists of the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils, through the foramen magnum resulting in alteration and compression of postero-inferior cerebellar structures. Cerebellar findings, notably smaller cerebellar volumes, are amongst some of the earliest reported differences noted in ADHD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Variations in cerebellar structure and functional connectivity have been reported in ADHD and ADHD symptom severity has been shown to correlate with the degree of reduction in volume of both the posterior vermis and of the cerebellum as a whole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【16】A review of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a sample of 86 children with a formal diagnosis of CM-I revealed elevated rates of psychiatric diagnoses, including ADHD (22.1%), anxiety (12.8%), and depression (10.5%) when compared to published norms in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Changes in the cerebellum and associated structures have also been linked with ASD, as was highlighted in the case report by Osuagwu and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Their article underlined the neurobiological link between ADHD and ASD, as the cephalocranial disproportion in neural tissue in CM-I is also seen in ASD.\n\n【18】Furthermore, structural and functional imaging studies have shown evidence of altered brain volumes in ADHD leading to dysfunction in fronto-subcortical pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. A recent fMRI study noted that the altered connectivity in the cerebellar network was present in the combined type of ADHD (inattentive and hyperactive) as compared with alterations in the cingulo-frontoparietal attention and visual networks found in the predominately inattentive subtype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Unfortunately, the absence of studies examining the association between ADHD and the different types of CM is a significant limitation of the available literature; it would be interesting to explore the relationship of severity of one condition and its correlation with that of the other. Additionally, an examination of the order of onset of cerebllar malformations and ADHD would inform the directionality of a causal relationship between the two conditions.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】This case report suggests a potential link between CM and ADHD which may itself be, in part, a result of cerebellar dysfunction. Imaging might not be appropriate in every case of ADHD but may be considered when the clinical signs and symptoms of CM are present such as headaches, neck pain, dizziness, and visual disturbances. These observations add to data suggesting that the cerebellum and its associated neural networks may play a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD.\n\n【22】#### Abbreviations\n\n| ADHD: | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |\n| --- | --- |\n| CM: | Chiari malformation |\n| ASD: | Autism spectrum disorder |\n| TBL1X: | Transducin β\\-like 1 X-linked gene. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:45", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:48:00", "cost": 15.082}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:44"}

Case Report\n\n【5】A previously healthy 67-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 15-year history of widespread skin lesions. She had recurrent pruritic papular eruptions and slowly progressing brownish lentigo-like macules. The skin lesions began on the trunk and then became generalized, involving the extensor and flexural surfaces of extremities, including the back of the hands, neck, and trunk. Clinical examination revealed numerous generalized symmetrically distributed brownish macules and some pruritic, hyperkeratotic, erythematous papules . The face, palms, and soles were spared, and she had no nail, hair, teeth, or mucosal alterations. There was no atrophic or hypopigmented lesions. No family history of similar lesions was known. She was previously treated with topical corticosteroids without improvement. Laboratory examinations demonstrated no abnormalities. Histopathologic examination of three biopsy specimens revealed digitiform epithelial downgrowths of the rete ridges, with hyperpigmentation of the basal layer confined to the tips of the rete ridges. Multiple foci of suprabasilar acantholysis were also observed  and a mixed dermal inflammatory infiltrate. In one of the biopsy specimens, we found acantholytic and dyskeratotic cells .

Discussion\n\n【10】Galli-Galli disease is a benign but very pruritic and unaesthetic genodermatosis. Its mode of inheritance is believed to be autosomal dominant with variable penetrance, but it can occur sporadically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, as in our patient. As with DDD it is believed to be linked to mutations in the KRT5 gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Clinically it is characterized by reticulated hyperpigmentation predominantly affecting the flexures along with pruritic, erythematous, scaly papules, similar to the DDD. Histopathologic examination reveals digitiform elongation of the rete ridges seen in DDD, together with suprabasal focal acantholysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–9\\]</u>.\n\n【11】A few patients have been described in the literature. A literature search revealed 9 previous case reports of GGD, with a total of 17 patients . According to the reported cases, the age range of presentation is 15 to 67 years, 11 patients were male, and 6 were female. All the patients in the reports had reticulated hyperpigmentation in the flexural areas, with the exception of one. In our patient, the characteristic hyperpigmentation of the axillae and inguinal region could not be detected, rendering a diagnosis of GGD difficult.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Reported cases of Galli-Galli disease.</u>\n\n【13】In 15 of the 17 cases a skin biopsy was performed, and in all of this cases acantholysis was identified, but dyskeratosis was present in only 3 cases. In our case we also identified dyskeratotic cells in one of the fragments, closely resembling features of Darier’s or Grover’s diseases. However, Darier’s disease could be ruled out by the presence of areas of digitate proliferations of the rete ridges, clinically it starts early, lentigo-like macules are rare, and it is commonly associated with nail and mucous membrane involvement that was absent in our patient. In Grover’s disease involvement of the distal extremities, as in our patient, and the presence of brown lentigo-like macules are not common. Histologically, areas of lentiginous elongations of the rete ridges are not observed in Grover’s disease.\n\n【14】Acantholysis is a sine qua non condition for the diagnosis of Galli-Galli disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–9\\]</u>, but dyskeratosis is not an essential finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, although its presence does not exclude the diagnosis.\n\n【15】Because of the overlap of clinical features, to the majority of authors GGD is best considered as an acantholytic variant of Dowling-Degos disease rather than an entity of its own 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>; however, some authors defend that if one accepts the histopathological finding of acantholysis as a pathognomonic feature, GGD should be classified as its own disease entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:39:55", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:40:02", "cost": 7.05}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:40:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:39:55"}

The patient did not report any underlying disease other than chronic hypertension for which no drug was used. She did not mention her history of smoking, alcohol, or drugs.\n\n【7】The morning after admission, the patient suddenly experienced sweating, anxiety, pain, and tetanic uterine contractions without vaginal bleeding. On examination, the patient had a heart rate 100 per minute, blood pressure 90/70, and respiratory rate 20 per minute. On suspicion of PA, the patient was asked for an obstetric ultrasound, and according to the diagnosis of PA and fetal bradycardia (90–100 beat/min), the patient was immediately transferred to the operating room for cesarean section (CS). The abdominal layers were opened with a Pfannenstiel incision, Kerr incision was made on the uterus. The first infant with an Apgar score of zero and the second infant with an Apgar score of 3–5, expired despite advanced resuscitation, and the placenta was more than 90% detached. After the placenta was removed, large clots were seen behind it, all of which were removed. The patient’s uterus was soft, pasty, blue, and Couvelaire.

Also, to maintain the uterus and control its atony, compressive sutures were applied and oxytocin (80 U/L IV), misoprostol (1000 μgr rectal), and tranexamic acid (1 gr IV) were prescribed to the patient. After controlling the bleeding, the uterus was returned to the abdomen and a drain was inserted into the patient. According to the goal of fluid and electrolyte correction and due to the continuation of anuria (Creatinine = 2.8), a central venous line was inserted for the patient and a high-dose diuretic (Lasix), labetalol, serum nitro-glycerine, and hydralazine were prescribed to control the patient’s accelerated hypertension, the patient’s echocardiography was normal; therefore, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospitalized in the ICU for two weeks.\n\n【10】During ICU admission, due to increased creatinine and oliguria, the patient underwent 9-time hemodialysis and due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the patient received 11 pack cells, 35 platelets, 20 FFP, 8 Cry, IVIG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, and dexamethasone (20 mg IV 2 day). Also, due to the possibility of sepsis, vancomycin (1 gr IV 48 h after dialysis) and metronidazole (500 mg daily) were administered GFR adjust and meropenem (500 mg daily). Also, due to the positive culture for acinetobacter, colistin was administered for one week.

The incidence is around 1% and the treatment of choice is obstetric hysterectomy, however, in some cases, close monitoring and timely decision-making can prevent hysterectomy. Herein, we present a rare and serious case of CU with uterus preservation in a young multiparous with a high-risk pregnancy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Couvelaire uterus (CU) or uteroplacental apoplexy was first described in 1911 by Dr. Alexandre Couvelaire. CU is one of the rare nonfetal complications of severe abruption and is associated with placental abruption (PA); the incidence and maternal mortality are around 1% and 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】CU manifests when a ruptured decidual spiral artery causes hemorrhage and bleeds into the decidua basalis and myometrium, followed by blood penetration into the uterine serous layer causing a blue-violet ecchymosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A hysterectomy may be the only way as a life-saving measure if hemostasis cannot be achieved adequately in view of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

Herein, we present a rare and serious case of CU with uterus preservation in a young multiparous with a high-risk pregnancy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】Our case report describes a 28-year-old female patient (gravida two, para one) with monochorionic diamniotic twin Gestation, in the 30th week (30 + 6) who presented to Fatemieh Hospital (Hamadan) Emergency with hypertension (blood pressure 140/90) and was hospitalized with a diagnosis of preeclampsia, other vital signs of the patient were normal at the time of admission to the emergency room and the nonstress test (NST) of the twins was reactive. The patient did not report any underlying disease other than chronic hypertension for which no drug was used. She did not mention her history of smoking, alcohol, or drugs.\n\n【7】The morning after admission, the patient suddenly experienced sweating, anxiety, pain, and tetanic uterine contractions without vaginal bleeding. On examination, the patient had a heart rate 100 per minute, blood pressure 90/70, and respiratory rate 20 per minute. On suspicion of PA, the patient was asked for an obstetric ultrasound, and according to the diagnosis of PA and fetal bradycardia (90–100 beat/min), the patient was immediately transferred to the operating room for cesarean section (CS). The abdominal layers were opened with a Pfannenstiel incision, Kerr incision was made on the uterus. The first infant with an Apgar score of zero and the second infant with an Apgar score of 3–5, expired despite advanced resuscitation, and the placenta was more than 90% detached. After the placenta was removed, large clots were seen behind it, all of which were removed. The patient’s uterus was soft, pasty, blue, and Couvelaire. Diffuse hematomas were also seen with spreading in the pampiniform plexus, broad ligament, and posterior uterus. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The dark purple and copper color patches with ecchymosis and indurations diagnostic of couvelaire uterus or uteroplacental apoplexy.</u>\n\n【9】Due to continuous bleeding and anuria, transfusion of 3 packed red blood cells, 3 fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 3 cryoprecipitate (Cry) were started for the patient. Also, to maintain the uterus and control its atony, compressive sutures were applied and oxytocin (80 U/L IV), misoprostol (1000 μgr rectal), and tranexamic acid (1 gr IV) were prescribed to the patient. After controlling the bleeding, the uterus was returned to the abdomen and a drain was inserted into the patient. According to the goal of fluid and electrolyte correction and due to the continuation of anuria (Creatinine = 2.8), a central venous line was inserted for the patient and a high-dose diuretic (Lasix), labetalol, serum nitro-glycerine, and hydralazine were prescribed to control the patient’s accelerated hypertension, the patient’s echocardiography was normal; therefore, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospitalized in the ICU for two weeks.\n\n【10】During ICU admission, due to increased creatinine and oliguria, the patient underwent 9-time hemodialysis and due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the patient received 11 pack cells, 35 platelets, 20 FFP, 8 Cry, IVIG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, and dexamethasone (20 mg IV 2 day). Also, due to the possibility of sepsis, vancomycin (1 gr IV 48 h after dialysis) and metronidazole (500 mg daily) were administered GFR adjust and meropenem (500 mg daily). Also, due to the positive culture for acinetobacter, colistin was administered for one week. Anticoagulant (heparin) was prescribed for the patient after the platelet count increased to more than 50,000 .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory test.</u>\n\n【12】After two weeks, with a gradual decrease in creatinine and improvement of tests, hemodialysis and antibiotics were stopped and the patient was transferred to the ward, and after a week, the patient was discharged from the hospital with Cr = 1/3.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】We present an unusual case of a CU that despite unstable homeostasis and severe bleeding in the myometrium and subserosal, without the need for hysterectomy, the patient was successfully treated.

Many patients are asymptomatic, and a few may present with symptoms such as dysphagia and chest pain. However, heartburn is only reported in patients with accompanying hiatal hernia. We hereby report a giant lower esophageal leiomyoma with concomitant hiatal hernia in a young Vietnamese female, who presented with refractory gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. The diagnosis was challenging as the tumor grew outward. As a consequence, the patient did not experience dysphagia and the tumor was hardly detected under endoscopy. The hiatal hernia in this patient was probably related to the presence of the leiomyoma. It is important to look carefully for submucosal tumor at the lower esophagus and cardia under endoscopy in patients with similar manifestations.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Esophageal leiomyoma is a rare disease, which is commonly reported in patients aged 40 to 50 years with a male-to-female ratio of 2 : 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. About a half of patients with esophageal leiomyoma are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Also, the majority of patients experience symptoms only if the tumor is large. The mean tumor diameter among symptomatic patients is about 5.3 cm, as compared to 1.5 cm in asymptomatic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The most common symptom is dysphagia followed by chest pain while heartburn is only reported in patients with accompanying hiatal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. We hereby report a giant lower esophageal leiomyoma with concomitant hiatal hernia in a young female patient, who presented with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The diagnosis was challenging as the tumor protruded only a little into the esophageal lumen. As a consequence, the patient did not experience dysphagia and the tumor was hardly detected under endoscopy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 28-year-old female patient suffered from postprandial lower chest pain and heartburn for more than one year. Her past medical history and family history were unremarkable. She lost 4 kilograms and did not experience dysphagia or regurgitation. Three months before her visit to our hospital, the pain had become more severe. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) performed at another hospital showed a lower esophageal ulcer, which was located just above the gastroesophageal junction, hiatal hernia, and antral-predominant gastritis . The H. pylori antibody test was positive, and the histological result of esophageal ulcer was benign. The patient received H. pylori eradication therapy followed by a regimen of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) at a standard dose in combination with antacid for more than 8 weeks. However, her pain did not resolve and she sought for medical consultation in our hospital.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The esophageal ulcer just above the gastroesophageal junction and hiatal hernia detected during the first upper astrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) (a, b). The ulcer had completely healed after 10-week treatment with double-dose proton pump inhibitor. A protrusion at the cardia, which was only identified on the look down view with minimum insufflated air, suspecting submucosal lesion is shown (c, d). The UGIE performed four months after her surgery demonstrated good results of Nissen fundoplication (e, f).</u>\n\n【7】We managed the patient as a case of refractory GERD. At first, the patient was treated with rabeprazole 20 mg bid in combination with alginate-antacid at bedtime for 2 weeks. The pain improved but was still intolerable and badly affected her sleep quality. The regimen was switched to rabeprazole 20 mg bid in combination with amitriptyline 12.5 mg at bedtime, which resulted in a complete clinical response and was continued for 10 weeks. The dose of rabeprazole was then tapered to 20 mg qd aiming to stop completely before UGIE was performed to document the efficacy of treatment. However, the pain recurred badly after about a week. The patient requested us return to double-dose rabeprazole, which again relieved the pain.\n\n【8】The second UGIE performed when the patient was still on PPI showed that the lower esophageal ulcer had completely healed . There was a protrusion at the cardia, which was only identified when air was minimum insufflated, suspected of a submucosal lesion. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and CT scan were performed which surprisingly showed a giant submucosal tumor at the fourth layer of the lower esophagus and the cardia . EUS-FNA was performed, and the histological examination confirmed that this lesion was a leiomyoma .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Endoscopic ultrasound showed that the submucosal tumor arose from the fourth layer of the esophageal wall (a, b). EUS-FNA was performed (c).

In addition, hiatal hernia was repaired with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication . As the tumor is too large, it was cut into pieces to facilitate its removal. The solid straightened tumor was approximately 8 cm × 3 cm in size . The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery. During the first two weeks, she had experienced dysphagia and regurgitation, which have resolved completely.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 The distal esophagus evolving leiomyoma was mobilized from the mediastinal pleura and structures (a, b). The leiomyoma was carefully dissected out of the esophagus (c). The tumor had been completely removed (d). Nissen fundoplication was performed (e). The postoperation specimen is shown (f).</u>\n\n【13】Four months after her surgery, UGIE was performed again which showed good results of fundoplication surgery . The patient sometimes had epigastric pain which could be completely controlled with intermittent rabeprazole therapy at a standard dose.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】The clinical presentation of this patient would suggest dyspepsia be a differential diagnosis as postprandial pain is the predominant symptom. However, the first UGIE clearly showed an esophageal ulcer accompanying hiatal hernia. This suggested that the pain be an atypical symptom of GERD. According to the Asia-Pacific consensus, reflux symptoms which respond poorly to PPI at a standard dose in 8 weeks are considered as refractory GERD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This patient satisfied this definition, and she was managed as refractory GERD. The lower esophageal ulcer as a complication of GERD and the presence of hiatal hernia were the two factors suggesting that acid suppression not be enough in this patient.\n\n【16】The findings on EUS and CT scan and intraoperative observation all showed that the tumor did not penetrate the mucosal layer. The esophageal ulcer could be due to tumor compression, which caused anatomical changes weakening the antireflux barrier. That the giant tumor was missed during the first UGIE would be due to some reasons. First, this leiomyoma tumor did not protrude much into the esophageal lumen. Therefore, dysphagia was absent and its endoscopic detection required a high suspicion with minimum air insufflation. There have been some case reports showing that esophageal leiomyoma might even masquerade as achalasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Dysphagia was the predominant symptom in these patients, and UGIE revealed a dilated and tortuous esophagus with no clear findings suggesting of submucosal tumor. Second, the patient is a young female while leiomyoma has been generally reported in middle-aged, male patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. A few case reports in Asia previously described giant esophageal leiomyoma in young females, but the diagnosis of these cases were not challenging as dysphagia was a predominant symptom and the tumors were easily identified under endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. This is the first time that such a giant leiomyoma is reported in a young woman in Vietnam.\n\n【17】There were several options for the enucleation of such tumors, such as the thoracotomic, thoracoscopic, or laparoscopic approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. However, the laparoscopic transhiatal approach was chosen in order to avoid causing extensive defect in the esophageal wall, which might lead to impaired esophageal peristalsis and damage of the lower esophageal sphincter. Also, the hiatal hernia was finally repaired with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication after finishing the enucleation procedure. Recently, submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection has been introduced into the management of subepithelial lesions of the esophagus. Using meticulous dissection techniques, en bloc resection of giant esophageal leiomyoma could be performed safely and effectively in the hands of experts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】This case raises some interesting questions. First, whether the pain in this patient was due to tumor compression or cardia ulceration or it was actually an atypical reflux symptom. As the frequency and severity of the pain paralleled with the intensity of acid suppression therapy, acid reflux would be the major pathogenesis factor. But, that the pain was completely controlled with a neuromodulator add-on therapy suggested that tumor compression be a contributory factor. The weak point of this case was that there was no esophageal manometry and pH monitoring investigations to document the symptom index. However, that the pain significantly improved after tumor removal and hiatal hernia repair and only intermittent standard-dose PPI therapy was enough to control the patient’s symptoms supported this theory. Second, whether there was a direct association between the presence of leiomyoma and hiatal hernia or this coexistence was by chance in this patient. There have been several studies showing that the coexistence between hiatal hernia and lower esophageal submucosal tumor was very common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 12, 13\\]</u>. A case series on 66 patients who underwent surgery therapy for esophageal leiomyoma found that hiatal hernia presented in 15 (23%) patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The association may be incidental, but there is also suggestion that the tumor pulls the esophageal-gastric junction and causes hiatal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In Vietnam, the prevalence of hiatal hernia was only 2.3% among patients who presented with upper gastrointestinal symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Also, it was especially very uncommon in such a young female. Therefore, we believe that the hiatal hernia could be associated with the leiomyoma in this patient.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【20】We report a case of giant lower esophageal leiomyoma with concomitant hiatal hernia in a young female, who presented with refractory gastroesophageal reflux symptoms.

After discharge, a progressive withdrawal of prednisone was accomplished. One year after, PAN has not relapsed.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】We have presented a case of PAN revealed by ischemic colitis necessitating acute surgical intervention.\n\n【21】Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), first described in 1866 by Kussmaul and Maier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, is systemic necrotizing vasculitis that predominantly affects medium sized arteries and is primary in most patients but is the consequence of viral infections, mainly hepatitis B virus (HBV), in some. Biopsy material can prove the diagnosis, especially if an affected area or lesion of the skin, muscle, or other tissue is available. The characteristic histopathological changes of PAN are fibrinoid necrosis of the walls of medium or small arteries, with a marked inflammatory response within or surrounding the vessel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【22】PAN involves the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in more than 50% of patients at some time during its course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Clinically apparent ischemic disease of the small bowel is the frequent site of involvement. The colon is less commonly involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The presentation of colonic PAN may mimic inflammatory bowel disease in young patients and atherosclerotic ischemic colitis in older ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Thus, any GI symptoms which are preceded by fever, weight loss, myalgia, or arthralgias should raise the possibility of vasculitis. In those patients who do not require an urgent intervention, a deep endoscopic biopsy must be taken. This can give the diagnosis without the need for surgery.\n\n【25】When studying 342 patients with PAN, Pagnoux found that GI involvement was present in 132 cases (37.9%) and was significantly more frequent in HBV related PAN (P < 0.001) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. GI manifestations requiring surgery were noted in 48 patients (13.8%). In multivariate analysis, Gl manifestations requiring surgery at diagnosis were associated with increased risk of death. Bourgarit et al. conclude that GI symptoms were most frequently associated with early death from HBV-PAN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Although GI involvement is frequent in PAN, the isolated abdominal initial presentation is uncommon, and since 1975, only 9 cases have been published in the English language literature. They are summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–15\\]</u>.\n\n【27】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of reported cases of PAN presenting with ischemic colitis.</u>\n\n【28】In the presence of acute abdominal signs, early surgery is warranted. In their absence, medical treatment should suffice. In all cases, close observation by a surgical team must be undertaken.\n\n【29】For many years, PAN treatment has involved administration of high-dose steroid with an additional cytotoxic agent, such as cyclophosphamide, to induce remission. In most patients, it is appropriate to treat aggressively. Once remission is achieved, maintenance therapy with daily or alternate-day low-dose prednisolone and oral azathioprine is frequently used for up to 18 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【30】PAN, unlike some other vasculitides such as Wegener granulomatosis, appears to be a condition in which permanent remission can be achieved.

Introduction\n\n【3】Secondary amyloidosis can complicate chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis. However, the clinical findings of primary amyloidosis may mimic those of primary rheumatologic disorders. We present the case of a 53-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who presented for evaluation of fingernail changes for the previous three years. The nails had vertical ridges and had cracked to the nail base. Occasionally, she also had mild pallor and bluish discoloration of her fingers on exposure to cold, suggestive of Raynaud’s phenomenon. She had had diarrhea alternating with constipation and mild abdominal cramping for 3 years. Colonoscopy was done a year earlier and showed only diverticulosis of sigmoid colon; she was given a diagnosis of IBS by a gastroenterologist. Other symptoms included diffuse alopecia, dry eyes, fatigue, and numbness in both forearms and fingers bilaterally. She had had unilateral carpal tunnel release in the prior year; tissue was not sent for pathologic examination. Family history was significant for her mother having myelofibrosis and acute leukemia, but there was no family history of autoimmune disease. Her physical examination was normal except for vertical ridging of dystrophic nails of the first, second, and third digits of both hands, diffuse alopecia with no scalp rash, scaling or scarring, and numbness in her first, second, and third digits of both hands with positive Phalen and Tinel test. She had no skin tightening, rashes, or telangiectasias. Complete blood count and complete metabolic panel including serum calcium, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein were unremarkable except for total protein of 5.4 g/dL (normal: 6.1–7.9 g/dL). She had a normal serum iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, TSH, free T4, and chest X-ray. Serologic testing revealed an ANA of 1 : 1280 in a nucleolar pattern. Antibodies to SSA, SSB, Smith, RNP, centromere, Scl-70, and dsDNA were negative; C3 and C4 were normal. She was initially diagnosed with Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease (UCTD) by her rheumatologist. But, given her neuropathy, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) was sent and it showed an increase in α2-globulin fraction (16.7%; normal: 8.9–14.5%) and decrease in γ\\-globulin level and fraction (0.4 and 7.0%, resp. normal: 0.6–1.9 g/dL; 9.8–24.4%) with an albumin-to-globulin ratio of 1.4. Serum immunofixation did not show any evidence of monoclonal gammopathy. Serum-free light chain assay revealed elevated free lambda light chains of 34.22 mg/dL (normal: 0.57–2.63 mg/dL) with low free kappa light chains of <0.29 mg/dL (normal: 0.33–1.94 mg/dL) and global decrement of IgG, IgA, and IgM. Urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation were unremarkable.\n\n【4】She was referred to the Hematology-Oncology consultation team for further evaluation of the light chain monoclonal gammopathy. A bone marrow biopsy  showed normocellular bone marrow with 15% plasma cells and lambda light chain restriction; Congo red staining was negative. A skeletal survey, LDH, and β2-microglobulin were negative. Given her constellation of symptoms, amyloidosis remained a diagnostic concern. An abdominal fat pad biopsy was performed, revealing positive Congo red staining . Electron microscopic examination revealed clusters of filamentous material with average diameter of 8.7 nm, lined between lipid droplets, compatible with amyloid; no amyloid typing was performed. The patient was diagnosed with free lambda light chain amyloidosis. Echocardiogram, pro-BNP, and Troponin T were obtained for staging; these were within normal limits. The patient was treated with 4 cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone. When near-complete remission was achieved with near-normalization of serum-free lambda light chains, decreasing to 3.07 mg/dL over 3 months, she subsequently underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation after melphalan conditioning. Her posttransplantation serum-free lambda light chains decreased to 2.69 mg/dL at three months and then normalized to 2.57 mg/dL at six-month follow-up. The patient returned to her normal level of excellent function, with resolution of her initial symptoms, and returned to work one month after the transplant procedure. She had no clinical features of autoimmune disease. No posttransplant serologies were obtained.\n\n【5】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bone marrow aspirate (a) and biopsy (b) showing scattered interstitial and focally clustered plasma cells and a small bland nonparatrabecular lymphoid aggregate.</u>\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CD138 immunohistochemistry (a) highlighting interstitial and clustered plasma cells, estimated at 15% of total cells, with lambda light chain restriction by in situ hybridization (b).</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Abdominal fat pad biopsy showing positive Congo red staining.</u>\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Deposits of amyloid may be distributed in many organs of the body (systemic amyloidosis) or may be restricted to a single organ (localized amyloidosis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. As demonstrated here, primary (AL) amyloidosis may mimic primary rheumatologic diseases such as SLE and Sjögren’s syndrome. When this occurs, no typical pathologic findings of rheumatologic diseases are found in the biopsies of joints, salivary glands, or blood vessels except amyloid accumulation in these tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Others also have described amyloidosis in rheumatic diseases such as Sjögren’s syndrome, scleroderma, and primary biliary cirrhosis as a secondary phenomenon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. In our patient, dry eyes can likely be explained by the amyloid deposition in lacrimal glands, masquerading as Sjögren’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. AL amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma may result in an arthropathy resembling RA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this setting, treating the underlying hematologic malignancy is the most important intervention as patients tend to respond better to multiple myeloma treatment than to treatment of the amyloid arthropathy. Sensitivity of selected physical and laboratory findings for detecting amyloidosis in cases of multiple myeloma (MM) associated arthropathy has been illustrated in literature  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. While our patient did not have arthropathy, she had bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and hypogammaglobulinemia, which raised the suspicion of AL amyloidosis. The carpal tunnel symptoms of the prior year are consistent with the typical 2-year delay between the onset of symptoms and the recognition of amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Sensitivity of selected physical and laboratory findings for detecting amyloidosis in the setting of multiple myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.</u>\n\n【11】Amyloid-associated rheumatic disease manifestations in primary amyloidosis have been associated with an anticentromere antibody pattern of ANA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, to the best of our knowledge, a nucleolar pattern ANA has not been previously described in this setting. Given the association of a nucleolar pattern ANA and scleroderma, our patient warrants follow-up for the progression to the development of scleroderma, though this seems unlikely in the setting of a successful stem cell transplantation and resolution of symptoms.\n\n【12】Alopecia or nail dystrophy can rarely present as a sign of occult amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Unusual manifestations of primary cutaneous amyloidosis in association with Raynaud’s phenomenon and livedo reticularis have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, but, in this case, Raynaud’s phenomenon preceded the cutaneous amyloidosis by ten years. Histopathology described in scalp biopsies of amyloid patients with alopecia has demonstrated that amyloid deposits were seen to be compressing pilosebaceous units, accompanied by atrophy of these structures and loss of hair from the shafts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Nail biopsy may show amyloid deposits in papillary dermis of the matrix, nail bed, and perivascular areas, which perhaps cause vascular impairment with subsequent nail brittleness, crumbling, onycholysis, subungual thickening, striation, or anonychia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Initially, the bone marrow biopsy in our patient was performed for the purpose of diagnosing plasma cell dyscrasia. The biopsy revealed lambda light chain restriction on in situ hybridization but negative Congo red staining. The diagnostic yield of bone marrow biopsy in primary amyloidosis is estimated at 63% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. We interpreted that the false-negative results could be due to variable and sometimes pale staining of amyloid fibrils, inadequate material, or improper use of polarizing instruments. In addition, the correct interpretation of Congo red staining requires experience and is somewhat subjective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Thioflavin staining is another option to confirm the validity of negative Congo red staining because it can detect smaller deposits, although it is less specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Abdominal fat pad aspiration has replaced most of the previously used tissue biopsies because it is easy to perform and safe and involves minimal patient discomfort and morbidity. Studies have shown that, in about 11 percent of cases, fat pad biopsy can be positive in the setting of negative bone marrow staining 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The sensitivity and specificity for abdominal fat pad aspiration are 55–85% and 75–100%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsy is a good diagnostic modality to consider for diagnosing amyloidosis mimicking Sjögren’s syndrome because it shares the advantages of abdominal fat pad aspiration with similar diagnostic yield and offers the ability to rule out Sjögren’s syndrome simultaneously. The diagnostic yield of LSG is roughly 58–86%, with specificity of 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>. Biopsy of another involved organ such as kidney, liver, colon, or heart can be utilized as well due to the high sensitivity (87–98%), if Congo red staining on the bone marrow and abdominal fat pad biopsy is negative, but there is high clinical suspicion of amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【15】To summarize, our patient presented with dystrophic nail changes, carpal tunnel syndrome, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and high titer positive nucleolar pattern ANA and was diagnosed with lambda light chain systemic amyloidosis by abdominal fat pad biopsy. Fortunately, in our case, the diagnosis was made before the development of cardiomyopathy, a complication significantly reducing life expectation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Based on the Revised Mayo Clinic Staging for amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, our patient was staged as Stage II, which has median survival of 97 months in stem cell transplant eligible patients versus 19 months in ineligible patients. Thus we treat amyloidosis early on, since prognosis in untreated AL amyloidosis is dismal. We suggest further monitoring for her positive nucleolar pattern ANA due to the possible progression to scleroderma or other rheumatic diseases, though this would be a remote possibility following her bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, due to the relatively low diagnostic yield of bone marrow biopsy, we employed an alternate diagnostic modality with little morbidity (abdominal fat pad aspiration) to establish this patient’s diagnosis. Our case also highlights the many similarities in the clinical features between systemic light chain amyloidosis and primary rheumatological disorders. It also underlines the importance of the prompt recognition of “red flags” of amyloidosis which are crucial to triggering appropriate diagnostic procedures, since early diagnosis prior to the development of advanced cardiomyopathy is a key to improving outcomes in this disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:56:12", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:57:03", "cost": 51.086}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:57:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:56:11"}

This case has two peculiarities. First the pancreatic metastasis was treated just with medical therapy, that is, Sunitinib, instead of the surgical therapy that is mostly considered. Secondly, the pancreatic lesion showed different characteristics on the computed tomography scan compared to the usual pancreatic metastases from renal clear cell carcinoma. The pancreatic metastasis totally regressed after medical treatment and nowadays, four years after the diagnosis, the patient is disease-free.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】The patient, a 75-year-old female, had a positive oncological anamnesis: her brother was affected by rectal neoplasm and her three aunts were affected by breast cancer, bladder cancer, and rectal cancer, respectively. The patient was under medical treatment for hypertension and due to the onset of general malaise, anemia, and asthenia, she performed a total body contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan. CECT total body scan was performed with a triphasic study of the abdomen and with a urographic phase. The scans showed the presence of an expansive solid growing mass with multilobulated shapes on the left kidney. The lesion was 90 mm (Longitudinal Diameter-LD) × 85 mm (Transversal Diameter-TD) × 96 mm (Anteroposterior Diameter-APD) sized . The mass infiltrated the renal pelvis and the mid calyx ; proximal ureter was encased but not infiltrated . The mass showed an inhomogeneous enhancement after contrast medium administration due to the presence of solid parts; many colliquative-necrtotic areas and intralesional calcifications were also found . An enlargement of the ipsilateral splenic vein, 9 mm sized , and many intralesional collateral vessels were also observed . No radiological signs of thrombosis of the main arteries or veins were detected. At the istm of the pancreas a nodular round-shaped lesion, 6 mm in size, was observed. The lesion, isodense in the precontrast scans , after contrast medium administration, appeared hypervascularized in all the three phases of the study with a rich vascular supply  and was referable, due to its contrastographic behavior, to a local metastasis or to a primitive neuroendocrine tumor. The pancreatic lesion showed on CECT scan unusual characteristics for a metastasis from renal clear cell carcinoma and, before considering surgical excision of the pancreatic mass, we decided that biopsy of the pancreatic lesion was needed in order to assess its nature. So the patient underwent a left nephrectomy with surrenalectomy and at the same time biopsy of the pancreatic lesion was performed. At the histological examination the renal mass resulted to be a clear cell carcinoma and the pancreatic lesion was found to be a metastasis of clear cell renal carcinoma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) and (b) show the presence of the renal lesion with multilobulated shapes, in the left kidney, 90 mm (LD) × 85 mm (TD) × 96 mm (APD) in size.

So, the patient started medical treatment with Sunitinib, 50 mg/day for two cycles. Due to the onset of grade III skin toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity, the dose of Sunitinib was reduced to 37.5 mg/day for other six cycles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. After three months of treatment another CECT total body scan was performed. CECT scan showed in the posterior-basal segment of the inferior right lobe, close to the pleural wall, a solid nodular lesion, 10 mm (LD) × 8 mm (TD) × 8 mm (APD) sized . The hypervascularized pancreatic lesion was not more observed; a hypodense round-shaped lesion in the same region was observed  which was a colliquative-necrotic outcome of the therapy. Considering that the lung lesion appeared during treatment with Sunitinib we thought that the best therapeutic choice was to remove surgically the lung lesion, mainly for two reasons. The first reason was that the patient was in good general clinical condition with adequate lung function and the lesion was surgically resectable. So, according to guidelines, surgery was indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The second reason was that the lung lesion appeared during treatment with Sunitinib, while the pancreatic metastases disappeared, so there was a possibility that the lung lesion was a second malignancy. In our case we decide to surgically remove the lung lesion in order to cure the patient and also because a histological characterization of the lung lesion was needed in order to differentiate the lung lesion from a second malignancy. Therefore, the patient performed surgical removal of the lung lesion. Histological examination deposed for metastasis from clear cell renal carcinoma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Images show the presence of the nodular lesion in the posterior basal segment of the inferior right lobe ((a) and (b)) and the pancreatic lesion after the treatment appeared hypodense due to necrotic-colliquative phenomena ((c) and (d)).

The previous hypodense lesion seen at the istm of the pancreas totally regressed and no other pancreatic lesions were observed . Nowadays the patient is under oncological follow-up; she is in a good state of health, and she is disease-free for 47 months from the diagnosis of the tumour and for 20 months from the end of the treatment with Sunitinib.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | Images show the absence of local relapses after the surgery in the left kidney (a) and in the lung (b); the hypodense pancreatic lesion was not more detectable at the pancreatic istm and no other pancreatic lesions were seen (c).

Discussion\n\n【14】The presence of pancreatic metastases from solid tumours is a rare event, with an incidence rate varying from 1.6% to 11% in autopsy series of patients affected by advanced neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The neoplasms that could give this type of metastases are melanoma, lung tumours, colic neoplasms, breast cancer, and with a higher rate of frequency kidney tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Metastasization to the pancreas is most likely due to haematogenous spreading and the site of the tumour, right or left kidney, is an independent prognostic factor of metastasization. This occurs, as described in the analysis of Sellner et al. for the high affinity of the renal cancer cells for the parenchyma of the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In a review of the literature performed by Sellner et al. diagnosis in only 35% of the cases was made in asymptomatic patients. In the remaining 65% of cases, the patients had various symptoms including the following: abdominal pain (20%), gastrointestinal bleeding due to infiltration of the duodenum (20%), obstructive jaundice (9%), weight loss (9%), pancreatitis, and diabetes (3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In many cases the metastases were metachronous with appearance 2–18 years after the diagnosis of the primary tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The treatment of the metastases is usually surgical, with good results in terms of overall survival (about 43 months) and disease-free survival (23.6 months), while the 5-year survival after surgery is between 43% and 88% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. Usually metastases from clear cell renal carcinoma on CT scan are isoattenuating in the unenhanced phase, as observed in our case. After contrast medium administration pancreatic metastases from renal clear cell carcinoma usually closely resemble the appearance of the primary carcinoma, showing on CECT scan irregular and not well-rounded shapes, a nonhomogenous and irregular contrast enhancement, and a central hypoenhancing necrotic portion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. Despite these general features, in our case the pancreatic metastasis on CECT scan showed well-rounded shapes and a homogenous and uniform contrast enhancement without any hypoenhnacing necrotic portion. According to the literature and to our daily radiological experience small hypervascular lesions, with rounded shapes and with a rich and uniform contrast enhancement, as observed in our case, rarely could be referred to metastases from renal clear cell carcinoma. Most often small pancreatic lesions, with rounded shapes and with a uniform contrast enhancement on CECT scan, could be referred to neuroendocrine pancreatic tumours, primitive or metastatic to the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. For these reasons the pancreatic lesion observed in our case presented, on CECT scan, unusual characteristics for a metastasis from renal clear cell carcinoma and this is why the biopsy of the lesion was performed.\n\n【15】In our case the diagnosis of the pancreatic metastasis is synchronous to the primary tumour, unlike the majority of the cases reported in the literature, where the metastases appeared many years after the diagnosis of the primary tumour. In our case the symptomatology was very mild and nonspecific, not clearly indicative of the presence of a pancreatic lesion. Although the guidelines indicate the need for a complete local excision, in our case the patient, who had just performed ​​a major abdominal surgery with nephrectomy, was not in suitable clinical conditions to undergo a second surgical procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Thus, the type of treatment we have chosen was pharmacological, using Sunitinib an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase receptor. Regarding the pulmonary mass, because it appeared during the treatment with Sunitinib, we had thought it was probably a selection of a clone of resistant cells or a second malignancy, so, considering that the patient at that time was in a good clinical condition to perform another surgery, the best therapeutic choice was the surgical resection in order to make a correct differential diagnosis and to obtain a complete eradication of the lung lesion. The management of lung metastases while on Sunitinib treatment must be assessed individually. The target is to reach the complete eradication of the disease with a multimodal approach. Unfortunately, currently there are no randomized trials designed to gain information about the correct timing of treatment strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The data reported in the literature show that metastasectomy after initial systemic therapy gave partial or complete response in a majority of patients. In these patients the median survival was 4.7 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In patients with a single resected pulmonary metastasis a 5 year-overall survival of 50% has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Moreover, it must be considered that there is a difference if the lung metastasis is already present before starting treatment with Sunitinib or if it appears during therapy. In the second case a II line pharmacological treatment is indicated, if metastasectomy is not possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Regarding the choice to continue or discontinue the systemic treatment after achieving a complete response, in the literature there are some studies on few patients, so the results are not yet conclusive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. It has been suggested that, after complete response, there may still be residual cancer cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Some articles published in literature affirm that the discontinuation of chemotherapy may allow the cells to proliferate and lead to disease recurrence, whereas continuation of chemotherapy maintains therapeutic pressure on the residual cancer cells, preventing disease recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Based on these data we continued treatment after achieving a complete response but, due to poor tolerance of the patient, we had to stop the treatment.\n\n【16】However our patient, 47 months after the diagnosis and 20 months after the end of the therapy, is in good condition and disease-free. It is important to remember that patients with pancreatic metastases from renal cancer could be symptomatic but also asymptomatic. Considering that renal clear carcinoma could give metastases even after many years the remission of the disease, a long time follow-up with periodic radiological exams should be performed in patients who had a renal clear carcinoma. Even if the treatment for pancreatic metastasis from renal clear carcinoma is surgical, also the medical therapy for the metastatic lesions could be considered and each case must be assessed individually.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:52:51", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:52:57", "cost": 6.195}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:52:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:52:49"}

The patient was treated with IV methylprednisolone followed by a 4-day course of oral prednisone, with significant improvement.

Introduction\n\n【3】Aspergillosis refers to a spectrum of disorders that can occur due to colonization with the Aspergillus fungus. Spores are commonly airborne in the environment but only classically cause disease in immunocompromised patients. Aspergillus is unique in the fact that it can result in either infectious or atopic manifestations. Types of aspergillosis diseases include allergic Aspergillus sinusitis, aspergilloma, invasive aspergillosis, fungal asthma, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】ABPA is an airway hypersensitivity reaction to the fungus that is almost exclusively seen in patients with cystic fibrosis or asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The estimated prevalence of ABPA among patients with asthma is approximately 1–2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The prevalence is slightly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis, estimating about 2–9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In rare cases, ABPA can be seen in lung transplant recipients or those with bronchiectasis, chronic granulomatous disease, or hyper-IgE syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) provides a proposed set of diagnostic criteria for ABPA  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.These criteria are divided into three groupings: predisposing conditions, obligatory criteria, and other criteria. One of the following predisposing conditions must be present: asthma or cystic fibrosis. Both of the following obligatory criteria must be present: positive Aspergillus skin test or IgE levels against Aspergillus that are detectable and an elevated serum IgE concentration. At least 2 of the following “other criteria” must be present: precipitating Aspergillus serum antibodies, pulmonary opacities seen on chest radiograph, or a serum eosinophil count greater than 500 cells/microliter in patients who have not been on glucocorticoids.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 ISHAM criteria for diagnosis of ABPA.</u>\n\n【7】Despite the requirement of one predisposing condition, ISHAM notes that a diagnosis of ABPA is still possible in patients without asthma or cystic fibrosis, albeit very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The objective of this case report is to highlight a rare case of ABPA in a patient with a history of chronic cocaine use and tuberculosis and no history of asthma or cystic fibrosis.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】This patient is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history of tuberculosis and a significant social history of chronic cocaine use who presented to the emergency department due to progressively worsening dyspnea over the last three months. On physical exam, the patient had diffuse wheezing. He also endorsed a 20-pound weight loss over the last three months and increased urinary retention. The patient denied fevers, chills, recent travel, hemoptysis, and cigarette smoking.\n\n【10】During his hospital stay, the following labs were performed: Acid-fast bacilli smear, Mycobacterium polymerase chain reaction, Legionella antigen, urine drug screen, immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, Aspergillus antigen, and neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody. Acid-fast bacilli testing was negative, as well as mycobacterium polymerase chain reaction, Legionella antigen, and neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine. Eosinophil count was elevated at 670 cells/μL (normal < 610 cells/μL). IgE level was also elevated at 2,378 kU/L (normal < 114 kU/L). Based on findings of elevated IgE levels, IgE against Aspergillus fumigatus was sought out and came back positive (0.56 kU/L).\n\n【11】Chest X-ray revealed hyperinflation, flattened diaphragm, and pleural thickening . Chest CT without contrast revealed some bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis in the bilateral lower lobes . In the right upper lobe, there was also some bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, and tree-in-bud nodularity . A 1.0 × 2.2 × 1.8 cm solid nodule was visualized in the posterior medial right lung . This was grossly stable in size from a chest CT 3 months prior.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Posterior-anterior chest X-ray revealing hyperinflation, flattened diaphragm, and pleural thickening.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Chest CT without contrast revealing (a) bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis in the bilateral lower lobes; (b) bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, and tree-in-bud nodularity; and (c) a 1.0 × 2.2 × 1.8 cm solid nodule in the posterior medial right lung.</u>\n\n【14】The patient was first treated at an outside hospital for pneumonia with amoxicillin-clavulanate and a 7-day course of prednisone 10 mg at the first onset of his symptoms. He reported transient improvement with steroids. On presentation, prior to confirmation of ABPA, the patient was treated with 60 mg intravenous methylprednisolone BID and inhaled ipratropium bromide with albuterol sulfate. Once ABPA was confirmed, the patient was transitioned from methylprednisolone to a 4-day treatment course with 60 mg oral prednisone. The patient noted significant improvement prior to discharge.\n\n【15】Given the concern for malignancy due to significant weight loss and urinary retention, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured. This was elevated at 11.2 ng/ml (normal < 4.0 ng/ml). Urology was consulted, and outpatient follow-up with urology was recommended for a transrectal ultrasound- (TRUS-) guided biopsy.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Aspergillosis refers to a spectrum of disorders that can occur due to colonization with a type of Aspergillus fungus, most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus. Spores are commonly airborne in the environment yet rarely cause disease in immunocompetent patients. On the other hand, immunocompromised patients are at risk of various presentations of disease due to inhalation of the fungus. Aspergillus is unique in the fact that it can result in either infectious or atopic manifestations. Types of aspergillosis infections include allergic Aspergillus sinusitis, aspergilloma, invasive aspergillosis, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Allergic Aspergillus sinusitis (AAS) is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus that results in sinusitis. The reaction is similar to that of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; however, it occurs in the sinuses. Despite the similar mechanism of colonization, few cases report simultaneous presence of both diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Patients at risk for developing AAS include those with a prior sensitization to the Aspergillus antigen who also have a past medical history of asthma or rhinosinusitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】An aspergilloma is an intracavitary fungus ball that typically presents in previously colonized areas of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. For this reason, many patients may have a history of colonization with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion with a thickened wall. In most instances, this is an incidental finding, and patients remain asymptomatic. Rarely, patients can present with hemoptysis secondary to blood vessel invasion. Aspergillus sensitization has also been commonly reported in the setting of pulmonary tuberculosis cavitary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Dhooria et al. reported that 16% of patients with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis had Aspergillus sensitization. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of tuberculosis is not a “predisposing condition” in the ISHAM criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Invasive aspergillosis refers to systemic dissemination of the fungus. Normally, alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells work together to rid the lungs of infection before dissemination can occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In cases where this is inefficient, the fungi are able to latch onto blood vessels, invade the endothelium, and spread throughout the body. Risk factors for invasive aspergillosis include severe neutropenia, glucocorticoids given in high doses, AIDS, and immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Once the fungus becomes systemic, it can affect almost every organ, including the liver, kidneys, eyes, and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to the Aspergillus fungus, similar to AAS. However, this reaction occurs in the airways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. ABPA is almost exclusively seen in patients with cystic fibrosis or asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The estimated prevalence of ABPA among patients with asthma is approximately 1–2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The prevalence is slightly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis, estimating about 2–9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In rare cases, ABPA can be seen in lung transplant recipients or those with bronchiectasis, chronic granulomatous disease, or hyper-IgE syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Diagnosis of ABPA is often made using the ISHAM criteria  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This patient presented with both “obligatory criteria” (elevated serum IgE concentration and elevated IgE levels against Aspergillus fumigatus). He also met two of the “other criteria” (tree-in-bud nodularity and bronchiectasis and total eosinophil count > 500 cells/μL). This case is unique in that the patient did not have any of the predisposing conditions. ISHAM notes that a diagnosis of ABPA can still be made despite not presenting with these conditions although this is rare.\n\n【23】ABPA is characterized by mucoid bronchial obstruction, resulting in wheezing and rhonchi. Given the background of hypersensitivity in this disease, patients typically have associated eosinophilia and eosinophilic pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Despite the severity of Aspergillus colonization, the fungi do not invade bronchial walls. In most cases, the presence of fungal spores in the lungs results in the formation of IgG and IgA against the antigens. These are sufficient enough to clear the Aspergillus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In patients with a history of atopy, additional IgE antibodies also form, manifesting as the hypersensitivity reaction of ABPA.\n\n【24】Similar to the pathogenesis of asthma, CD4+ helper T cells also play a role in the development of ABPA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. When exposed to fungus, helper T cells secrete interleukins (IL), which include IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In response to the interleukins, the body produces IgE and eosinophils, contributing even more so to the common finding of eosinophilia. Mucus plugs contain Charcot–Leyden crystals and eosinophils. Culture of these plugs may or may not grow the Aspergillus fungus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Chronic airway hyperreactivity due to ABPA can result in the development of bronchiectasis. Chest radiographs often reveal thickened bronchial walls and atelectasis secondary to mucoid plugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Initial pulmonary function testing presents with an obstructive pattern of changes, including an increased residual volume (RV) and a decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Recommended treatment focuses on controlling inflammation and is usually a taper of systemic glucocorticoids over three to six months.\n\n【26】ABPA is rarely reported in patients without asthma or cystic fibrosis. This patient is unique in that he did not meet the ISHAM predisposing conditions usually required for diagnosis of ABPA. It is important to note that this is a single case of such association, which does not warrant enough evidence to claim that chronic cocaine use and previously treated tuberculosis increase risk for ABPA. Nevertheless, it is our hope to make healthcare providers aware of its potential presence in chronic cocaine users and patients with tuberculosis, both of which are not traditionally associated with this condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:36:48", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:37:05", "cost": 17.598}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:37:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:36:47"}

She was feverish with a temperature of 39°C and had tachycardia and tachypnoea with an oxygen saturation of 98%. Investigations revealed leukocytosis. CXR showed right lower lobe consolidation, and CT thorax demonstrated collapse consolidation of the right middle and lower lobe, along with associated dilated segmental bronchioles and diffuse patch ground-glass opacity in both lung fields. Bronchoscopy revealed a pen cap at the entrance of the right lower lobe. Patient symptoms improved after removal of the foreign body. In patients with recurrent chest infection, the physician should check for the possibility of FBA and prompt for a referral to a tertiary center for further evaluation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Foreign body aspiration (FBA) is a common medical problem. Prompt action needs to be taken for early treatment and minimize the severity and fatal consequences. In the US, FBA leads to 7% of accidental death among children age less than four-year-old and 75 to 85% of accidental death in children under the age of 15 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. FBA in adults mostly is seen in the sixth or seventh decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. FBA can be further classified into organic and inorganic materials. Most organic materials causing FBA among children are nuts and seeds while among adults are food and bones. The most common types of inorganic FBA in children are beads, coins, pins, small parts of toys, or school pieces of equipment, i.e. pen caps. Dental prostheses, pills, and tops from beverage cans are the commonest FBA materials found among adult populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 24-year-old girl who has no medical illness was presented to the hospital with a one-year history of chronic cough and chest infection. She also had a loss of appetite and loss of weight for the past year. She was investigated for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and it turned out to be negative. She noticed that her cough was getting worse, and she also had an episode of hemoptysis a week before the presentation.\n\n【6】On examination, she was feverish with a temperature of 39°C. Her blood pressure was 100/56 mmHg, her heart rate was 150 beats/min, and her respiratory rate was 30 breaths/min. She was hypoxic with oxygen saturation under room air of 89%. In the emergency department, she was further deteriorating, and her oxygen saturation was dropped to 80% despite on a high flow mask. She was in respiratory distress, and we decided to intubate her. Respiratory examination revealed reduced air entry and coarse crepitations on auscultation as well as dullness on percussion over the right lower zone. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【7】Blood investigations revealed leukocytosis with a total white blood cell count of 10.4 × 10<sup>9</sup> (L). The rest of the blood investigations were normal. Chest X-ray showed a right lower lobe consolidation . Computed tomography of the lung demonstrated a collapse consolidation of the right middle and lower lobe, along with associated dilated segmental bronchioles. Diffuse patch ground-glass opacity was seen in both lung fields but worst in the left side and minimal fibrotic changes with associated pleural thickening in both apexes . Tracheal aspiration fluid culture and sensitivity had no growth after five days, and the tuberculous bacilli smear was negative. Mantoux test (purified protein derivative) was also negative. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was started on intravenous antibiotics. Unfortunately, her general condition and blood parameter were not improved; therefore, we decided to proceed with bronchoscopy. We are caught in a surprise to find a blue-colored foreign body at the entrance of the right lower lobe bronchus during the bronchoscopy . The foreign body was removed from the right lower bronchus, and it was a pen cap . After removal of the foreign body, the patient's clinical condition improved tremendously, and she was extubated. She was subsequently discharged after ten days of admission. Further history was obtained from the patient before she was discharged. She admitted that she accidentally ingested the pen cap while biting the pen cap while writing. She did not seek any medical advice at that time as she was asymptomatic.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest radiography showed right lower lobe consolidation.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Computed tomography of the lung demonstrated collapse consolidation of the right middle and lower lobe along with the lower lobe with associated dilated segmental bronchioles.

Discussion\n\n【13】FBA materials are different according to the age group. Among children, they are prone to inhale materials such as nuts, seeds, beads, coins, pins, small parts of varying toys, or school equipment such as a pen cap. The study by Adjesto et al. involving 33 children in Northern Ghana showed the commonest FBA in children was groundnuts (39.4%), and the remaining was metallic objects (21.1%). The bronchoscopic finding noted foreign bodies (FBs) mostly localized to the right (24.2%) and left (24.2%) main bronchi, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. There was a large study population conducted by Ciftci et al. in 2003 involving 663 children who suspected FBA, and 75% of them ingested organic materials such as sunflower seeds (27%), roasted chick-peas (15%), hazelnut (12%), and peanut (4%). In the same study, 25% of FBA cases involving inorganic materials which were straight pins (7%), the lid of ballpoint pens (6.2%), and plastic toy pieces (3.4%). However, the bronchoscopic finding noted FBs were mostly located in the right main bronchus (37%), left main bronchus (26%), and trachea (12%), respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The FBA in the adult is unique as the commonest materials inhaled were food, bones, dental prostheses, pills, and tops from the beverage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In our patient situation, we found pen caps which are usually found in children and toddlers. This is what happens when someone had a habit of biting the pen caps while writing and then incidentally swallowing the cap, which subsequently dislodged to the respiratory system instead of the alimentary system.\n\n【15】The symptoms and severity of FBA is variable from mild to severe, and it depends on the site of occlusion. Occlusion at the level of the larynx can cause choking and gagging. The patient will be presented with symptoms of hoarseness of voice, aphonia, and cyanosis and worst-case scenario, sudden death. Inspiratory stridor occurs when the obstruction is at the level of the trachea. However, an occlusion at the bronchus may cause cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and chest pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Chest X-ray (CXR) is essential in the diagnosis of FBA. Although 90% of the foreign bodies are radiolucent, a standard radiological workup including a posteroanterior and a lateral chest film and a lateral soft tissue neck radiograph should be done. If the patient presented within 24 hours, the CXR finding could be normal. The initial CXR finding will be unilateral or segmental hyperaeration, and the subsequent finding could be atelectasis, air trapping, pulmonary infiltrates, and mediastinal shift on expiratory film 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The gold standard approach for diagnosing FBA is by doing flexible/rigid bronchoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–13\\]</u>. Rigid bronchoscopy is the safest and preferred instrument used in the pediatric population, whereas in adults, the flexible bronchoscope is the preferred instrument for the diagnosis and removal of airway foreign bodies compared to rigid bronchoscope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 14\\]</u>. Removal of a foreign body by using bronchoscopy from the tracheobronchial area must be done by a trained and experienced person to minimize and avoid unnecessary complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Delayed complications associated with retained foreign body include nonresolving pneumonia, lung abscess, recurrent hemoptysis, lung fibrosis, obstructive emphysema, and bronchiectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>. In our patient, chronic retention of a foreign body in the bronchus lead to obstructive pneumonia. Localize obstructive bronchiectasis is one of the most important complications of a chronic FBA and may necessitate a surgical resection if it is complicated with recurrent infections. Obstructive bronchiectasis may develop many years after the unrecognized FBA. The standard surgical treatment for bronchiectasis is partial lobectomy of the affected lobe. There was a study reported that removal of the foreign body via bronchoscopy could achieve resolution of bronchiectasis and bronchial dilatation in a chronic FBA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Hence, flexible bronchoscopy should always be considered in cases with localized bronchiectasis or nonresolving pneumonia for the possibility of FBA to avoid patients from an unnecessary surgical procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】FBA should always be considered in the etiology of recurrent chest infections or hemoptysis, lung abscess, middle lobe syndrome, fibrotic changes such as scar formation, and bronchiectasis. Early suspicion of FBA among patients presented with recurrent chest infections should prompt the medical practitioner to make an early referral to a tertiary center for further evaluations. The community should be educated regarding the symptoms of foreign body aspiration so that there was no delay in seeking medical treatment. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a safe procedure for the initial diagnosis of a foreign body. It can avoid unnecessary general anesthesia and surgical resection. Moreover, the success rate of the flexible bronchoscope in removing foreign bodies can be as high as 100% in experienced hands. Removal of a foreign body can result in the resolution of lung parenchyma or bronchial pathology and hence can prevent unnecessary surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:39:45", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:39:53", "cost": 8.36}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:39:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:39:44"}

Discussion\n\n【14】Cornu cutaneum is a projectile, hyperkeratotic nodule in places of the body which are sensitive to sunlight and called cutaneous horns because of their similarity of their macroscopic shape 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Apart from sunlight, traumas are also included in their etiology as a case reported as cornu cutaneum on the feet of the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Our patient had a lesion in nasal vestibule supporting the traumatic etiological factors. He felt itching as the mass grew and he scratched; therefore, repeated traumas were made by the patient himself.\n\n【15】Cornu cutaneum is generally a slow developing mass. Our patient had nasal obstruction symptoms for more than 3 months and the mass became visible from outside the nose within a month. Cornu cutaneum is generally a benign lesion but is reported to have relation with malignant or premalignant diseases. Histological researches show that basal membrane invasion supporting differential diagnosis should include a wide range from seborrheic keratosis to squamous cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Predisposing factors include benign (seborrheic keratosis, viral verrucae, and molluscum contagiosum), premalignant (solar keratosis, arsenic keratosis, and Bowen’s disease), and malignant (squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, granular cell tumours, sebaceous carcinomas, and Kaposi’s sarcoma) diseases. Differential diagnosis can only be made by careful histopathological investigation of the basal lamina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Excisional biopsy can be made for diagnosis and treatment. We treated and diagnosed our patient with excisional biopsy. Isolated cornu cutaneum has dead keratin cells without any living tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Our pathological examination also showed papillomatous keratin lamellas without any alive cells.\n\n【17】As a result, as mostly seen in places which are sensitive to sunlight, cornu cutaneum from nasal vestibule is a rare disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> which is a slow developing benign lesion characterized by necrotic tissues without any living cells microscopically.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】Apart from sunlight, traumas are included in etiology of cornu cutaneum. As mostly seen in places sensitive to sunlight, cornu cutaneum from nasal vestibule is uncommon suggesting the effect of traumas.

MTS is classically described in females between the age group of 20–50 years. In patients with acute iliofemoral thrombosis, medical treatment with anticoagulation alone has been associated with higher risk of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) and lower iliofemoral patency rates, as compared to endovascular correction. We describe a case of MTS-related extensive iliofemoral DVT occurring in a middle age male who presented with acute onset of left lower limb swelling and pain, complicated by pulmonary embolism. Doppler compression ultrasonography of the left lower limb showed partial DVT extending from the left external iliac to the popliteal veins, and contrasted computed tomography (CT) of the thorax abdomen and pelvis established features of MTS, together with right pulmonary embolism. He was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and then underwent left lower limb AngioJet pharmacomechanical thrombolysis/thrombectomy, iliac vein stenting, and temporary inferior vena cava (IVC) filter insertion. After the procedure, the patient recovered and improved symptomatically with rapid resolution of this left lower limb swelling and pain. He was switched to an oral Factor Xa inhibitor and was subsequently discharged. After 1-month follow-up, he remained well with stent patency visualised on repeat ultrasound and underwent an uneventful elective IVC filter retrieval with subsequent plans for a 1-year follow-up.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】May–Thurner syndrome (MTS) was first described by May and Thurner in 1957 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. MTS is an anatomical variant in which the right common iliac artery overlies and compresses the left common iliac vein against the lumbar spine and is an important anatomical risk factor for venous thrombosis.\n\n【4】Although this variant has been shown to be present in more than 20% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>, the reported clinical prevalence of MTS-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been low at only 2-3% of all lower limb DVTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>, suggesting an underestimation of its actual prevalence. The most common clinical presentation of MTS is unilateral leg swelling due to an acute DVT and is more common in women with the majority between 20 and 50 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Treatment options for MTS-related DVT includes endovascular thrombolysis/thrombectomy and stent placement, in addition to standard anticoagulation.\n\n【5】We report a case of MTS-related extensive iliofemoral DVT occurring in a middle age male who presented with seemingly unprovoked left iliofemoral vein thrombosis, complicated by pulmonary embolism.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 63-year-old Chinese gentleman was admitted with a 4-day history of progressive left lower limb swelling and pain. There was no history of trauma to the leg. He did not have any fever, chest pain, breathlessness, nor constitutional symptoms.\n\n【8】This was his first episode presented as such. He had a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, when he was on diet control with no chronic medications. There was no family history of DVT. He had no recent prolonged flights or immobilization, although he was working as a private car hire driver with ten-hour shifts. He was a never smoker.\n\n【9】He was comfortable and afebrile with normal vitals and oxygen saturation. The cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. His left lower limb was warm and mildly tender, associated with swelling up to the midthigh measuring 4 cm more than the right . There was no evidence of stasis dermatitis, varicosities, or phlegmasia cerulean or alba dolens. His peripheral distal pulses were well felt.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Unilateral oedematous swelling of left lower limb.</u>\n\n【11】Initial blood investigations including full blood count, renal panel, and coagulation profile were normal; fasting glucose for diabetes screening was negative. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no heart strain. Doppler compression ultrasonography of the left lower limb showed partial DVT extending from the external iliac (EIV), common femoral (CFV), to the popliteal veins .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Ultrasound of left lower limb demonstrating (a) thrombosis involving the EIV, (b) failure of compressibility of CFV, and (c) no colour flow on duplex scan confirming the diagnosis of DVT. (d) CT of the patient showing the right CIA (white arrow) compressing the left CIV against the lumbar vertebrae (black arrow).</u>\n\n【13】In view of the extensive nature of the thrombosis, a contrasted CT of the thorax abdomen and pelvis was performed both to rule out an intrabdominal pathology as well as look for pulmonary complications in the same sitting. His CT eventually showed compression of the left common iliac vein (CIV) against the lumbar vertebrae by the overlying right common iliac artery (CIA), just caudal to its confluence with the right CIV , with no definite filling defect identified in the IVC. In addition, filling defects in the right upper lobe and lower lobe pulmonary arterial lobar/segmental branches were noted, consistent with pulmonary embolism without evidence of right heart strain. In the absence of any suspicious pelvic mass, these features were suggestive of MTS. He was started on LMWH enoxaparin.\n\n【14】During the operation, a temporary IVC filter was first inserted via a retrograde right femoral common femoral vein approach (Bard Denali) to mitigate the risk of massive pulmonary embolism and cardiovascular collapse during wire and device manipulation through the iliac thrombus. The left posterior tibial vein at the ankle was the initial vascular access site to allow full evaluation and thrombus removal of the entire femoropopliteal segment in addition to the iliac veins. Intraoperative venogram demonstrated extensive intravenous thrombus from the left CIV to proximal superficial femoral vein (SFV) . This was treated with AngioJet pharmacomechanical thrombolysis/thrombectomy (Boston Scientific, Massachusetts, United States of America) using the ZelanteDVT thrombectomy catheter and a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase 20 mg in 100 ml normal saline). Vascular access was then obtained via the left mid-distal femoral vein for diagnostic intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) which confirmed compression at the level of the CIV (cross-sectional area∼126 mm<sup>2</sup>) followed by iliac vein stenting using a 16 × 60 mm ABRE (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) bare metal stent. There was uninterrupted contrast flow through the left CIV upon completion of the procedure  with resolution of the compression and increased CIV cross-sectional area (∼198 mm<sup>2</sup>) on IVUS.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Intraoperative venogram (a) demonstrated extensive intravenous thrombus in the CFV and proximal SFV.

He was initially observed in the high dependency ward, with improvements of his lower limb swelling, and was subsequently transferred to the general ward where he remained well. His enoxaparin was switched to a Factor Xa inhibitor Apixaban (10 mg BD loading dose for 7 days followed by 5 mg BD maintenance dose), which he was discharged with to complete a total of 1 year duration. On his 1-month follow-up, the patient remained well with resolution of his lower limb swelling and pain. An ultrasound duplex iliac scan showed a patent left CIV stent with subacute to chronic venous thrombosis partially occluding the left CFV. He subsequently underwent an uneventful elective IVC filter retrieval, with plans for a 1-year repeat ultrasound and follow-up.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】MTS, also known as iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS), was first described by May and Thurner in 1957 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and is an important anatomical risk factor for venous thrombosis. The pathogenesis of MTS-related DVT is likely to be a combination of vascular endothelial thickening, reduced vein diameter, and mechanical compression. Although this variant has been shown to be present in more than 20% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>, the reported clinical prevalence of MTS-related DVT has been low at only 2-3% of all lower limb DVTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. This may suggest an underestimation of its actual prevalence and is likely due to missed diagnosis, especially in patients with other more recognisable risk factors.\n\n【19】The most common clinical presentation is unilateral leg swelling due to acute DVT and is more common in women with the majority aged between 20 and 50 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It can also present as chronic venous insufficiency and venous stasis with varicosities or ulceration. Other factors that may increase the likelihood that asymptomatic MTS will progress to symptomatic MTS include immobilization, contraceptive use, recent pregnancy, and previous intra-abdominal surgical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The treatment of MTS largely depends upon the presence of symptoms, their severity, and whether thrombosis is present. For symptomatic patients with iliofemoral DVT, as with our patient, treatment options include endovascular thrombolysis/thrombectomy and stent placement, in addition to standard anticoagulation. In observational studies and retrospective reviews of patients with MTS-related DVT, endovascular thrombolysis and/or stenting have consistently shown to be a safe and effective method for achieving high venous patency rates and provide relief of acute symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 9–11\\]</u>. In addition, though not stratified based on a diagnosis of MTS, systemic reviews of studies evaluating the treatment of acute iliofemoral thrombosis have shown that endovascular thrombolysis compared with anticoagulation alone is associated with higher iliofemoral patency rates and reduced risk for postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–16\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The optimal duration of anticoagulation is unclear due to the lack of consensus on postintervention antithrombotic therapy for MTS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. It is recommended that therapeutic anticoagulation should be continued using similar dosing, monitoring, and duration per venous thromboembolism (VTE) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>; direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), including apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are effective alternatives to vitamin K antagonist but their use remain limited in specific populations with pregnancy, cancer, and renal insufficiency conditions. In patients who have had stent placement, anticoagulation for at least six months to prevent in-stent restenosis is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Following successful thrombolysis and stent placement, patients are also encouraged the use of sized-to-fit compression stockings for prevention of PTS as per acute DVT treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>, assuming no contraindications including severe arterial insufficiency, overlying skin ulceration, or allergy to stockings material.\n\n【22】Our patient was diagnosed with MTS-related acute left iliofemoral DVT complicated by pulmonary embolism. His management included deployment of a temporary IVC filter, AngioJet pharmacomechanical thrombolysis/thrombectomy with iliac vein stent placement, and was discharged with apixaban with plans for repeat imaging to monitor stent patency.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】May–Thurner syndrome is an important anatomical risk factor for venous thrombosis and is very often underdiagnosed in patients with DVT. Our case underscores the importance of having an index of suspicion in patients who present with seemingly unprovoked left iliofemoral vein thrombosis, including in males. The consideration and accurate diagnosis of MTS remains critical, as in addition to standard therapeutic anticoagulation, these patients would benefit from anatomical correction of the affected segment to maintain venous patency and prevent long-term complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:58:55", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:07", "cost": 11.851}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:58:54"}

We have previously described a three-stage method to overcome this problem, involving genioplasty for improving the retruded chin, and to construct the infrastructure for subsequent subapical segmental alveolar osteotomy, subapical segmental alveolar osteotomy itself, and, finally, two-jaw surgery. Bone augmentation with thin cortical bone at the gap created on the upper surface of the advanced genial segment was also addressed in the previous report. In the present study, to confirm the benefits of the three-stage method using objective data, cephalometric evaluation was performed in each step. In all cases, pogonion (Pog) was moved forward substantially. Net linear forward movement of Pog and net changes in SN-Pog were from 12 mm to 20 mm and from 4.8° to 7.0°, respectively. Angle of mandibular incisors and interincisal angle also improved to desirable levels. Although this method requires three separate surgeries, the approach safely improves the clinical situation and accentuates treatment efficacy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In patients with mandibular retrognathia, many difficulties are encountered in achieving postoperative stability of treatment results, compared to patients with mandibular prognathia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In addition to disharmony between the upper and lower jaws in the anteroposterior direction, problems of the width of the basal arch, deficient perimeter, and subsequent tooth crowding must be considered. Furthermore, temporomandibular joint disorders, ranging from mere disk displacement to degenerative bone changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>, are also frequently seen in these patients compared to those with other skeletal patterns. Among these problems, the axis of the mandibular incisors has not tended to attract much interest. Our experience, however, suggests that it is one of the most crucial factors for achieving and maintaining postoperative stability. In patients with retrognathic mandibles, the mandibular incisors are often inclined labially with the roots impacted into the thin and retruded symphysis menti 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, and the buccal cortical bone is sometimes very thin with the roots present just beneath the alveolar mucosa. From the perspective of anterior guidance, the angle of the sagittal incisor path generally should be steeper than that of the sagittal condylar path, so that the condyle can rotate smoothly while gliding anteriorly when opening the mouth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In addition, all the individual mandibular teeth will incline further mesially in sequence from anterior to posterior, because the teeth will align along the labially inclined incisors. Contact points will be changed from desirable positions and the marginal ridge of the occlusal surface will be altered in a stepwise manner . Mastication under conditions of a sharp interincisal angle will result in further sharpening of the interincisal angle, as the maxillary incisors will be inclined more labially by the upthrust of severely inclined mandibular incisors, leading to instability of the incisors in both jaws. Meanwhile, the chin not only is one of the major determinants of the facial profile, but also is directly linked to function, and a retruded chin will result in an incompetent lip seal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Improving the axis of mandibular incisors together with mandibular advancement for chin protrusion is thus indispensable to improve oral function and achieve a proper intercuspation that will remain stable.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Mandibular teeth will incline mesially in sequence (red line) if the central incisor is inclined labially. Contact points will also change (arrow). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【5】The incisor axis, however, is not always easily improved by orthodontic treatment, because there is no room at the symphyseal region in the thin bone for tooth movement as mentioned before, and the root will be exposed if rotational movement around the incisal edge is forced . We therefore had thought about surgical interventions and planned sectional periapical segmental alveolar osteotomy with all the inclined teeth included. However, another problem came up that there would be no bone contact at the horizontal osteotomy site between surfaces of the dentate segment and mandibular body , meaning that the segment would be unstable. To overcome this problem, we established a unique method involving a three-stage surgery  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Originally, that paper was not intended to present the method but to demonstrate bone augmentation with a thin cortical bone at the gap created on the genial segment when performing advancement genioplasty. Thin cortical bone was harvested from the sharp lateral upper edge of the advanced genial segment and transferred to the midpoint just leaning on the anterior aspect of the tooth-bearing segment. Vacant space was thus made under the thin cortical bone. Several months after surgery, new bone was augmented in the former osseous void area and a voluminous configuration with a smooth surface was created. We have so far adopted this bone augmentation maneuver in our staged surgery for improving retrognathia with labially inclined incisors. The present study assessed the changes at each step cephalometrically, using three representative cases, and evaluated the efficacy of this three-stage method.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Diagrams of problems encountered when improving the tooth axis in patients with a thin symphysis.

Subjects\n\n【10】Representative cases with a diagnosis of retrognathia (2 women, 1 man) were selected from among consecutive cases of completed orthognathic and orthodontic treatment performed at Hokkaido University Hospital, Japan. Cases of retrognathia were judged by the agreement of the majority at conferences on jaw deformity in the university hospital, by physical examination in the outpatient ward, evaluation of facial measurements, working dental casts, cephalometric analysis, and computed tomography.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Orthodontic Treatment\n\n【12】In general, presurgical orthodontic treatment included extraction of the maxillary first premolars, alignment of crowded anterior teeth, linguoversion of the maxillary anterior teeth, and labioversion of the mandibular anterior teeth. After completing two-jaw surgery, postoperative orthodontic treatment was followed to establish fine occlusion.\n\n【13】##### 2.3. Surgery\n\n【14】The precise method is described in our previous report  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Briefly, advancement genioplasty with bone augmentation by thin cortical bone was performed in the early stage of the preorthodontic treatment to establish the foundation for the subsequent alveolar bone osteotomy, which was performed to improve the axis of the lower incisors. Two-jaw surgery was performed after the separately performed genioplasty and periapical segmental alveolar osteotomy. If necessary, the maxilla was further separated into two or three pieces to accommodate the width of the mandibular arch. The mandible was operated using bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy. Two plates were used on each side to stabilize the osteotomized segments in our original manner 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. None of the patients underwent maxillomandibular fixation.\n\n【15】##### 2.4. Evaluation\n\n【16】Lateral cephalograms were obtained on five occasions: immediately before and after genioplasty (T1 and T2, resp.), immediately after periapical segmental osteotomy (T3), immediately before two-jaw surgery (T4), and at debonding (T5). Lateral cephalograms were traced by a single investigator (K.M.) on two separate occasions at least 1 month apart, so that errors in cephalometry were small and acceptable for the purposes of this study. For coordination, we regarded the SN plane as the reference plane and rotated 7° counterclockwise so that the Frankfort plane would be parallel to the ground for linear measurement to a horizontal \\-axis and a vertical \\-axis. On this cross grid on lateral cephalograms, the angles of SNA, SNB, ANB, SN-Pog, SN-Mp, SN-occlusal plane, interincisal, and L1-Mp and linear lengths of overbite (OB), overjet (OJ), and Pog movement were measured.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【18】##### 3.1. Case 1\n\n【19】A 34-year-old woman visited our department with a chief complaint of masticatory dysfunction and incompetent lip seal. Representative values were SNA, +0.1 standard deviation (SD); SNB, −3.0 SD; SN-Pog, −3.3 SD; L1-Mp, 0.0 SD; interincisal angle, −0.9 SD; OB, +0.5 mm; and OJ, +9.0 mm. The cephalograms taken at each step are shown in Figure 4 and superimposed cephalometric tracing is provided in Figure 5. The lower and upper second premolars had already been extracted at 11 years of age due to crowding. The precise treatment course with cephalograms has already been described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and Cases 1 and 2 in the present study are the same as those in the previous one. Using advancement genioplasty, Pogonion (Pog) was moved 10.0 mm horizontally forward and 2.0 mm vertically upward. SN-Pog was improved to 4.3°. Bone was sufficiently augmented at the junction of the advanced segment and the anterior aspect of tooth-bearing segment. At this point, the L1-mandibular plane angle seemed to increase due to the change in reference line, because the mandibular plane angle was defined by the position of Go and Pog, and Pog was moved both anteriorly and superiorly by genioplasty. About 8 months later, segmental alveolar osteotomy was performed. The angle of the L1-mandibular plane was returned back to 92.9°, representing a more desirable value, and interincisal angle was improved from 115.5° to 123.1°. Preorthodontic treatment was performed for another 9 months, with no obvious cephalometric changes seen during this period (T3-T4). As the last step, two-jaw surgery was performed. The maxilla was separated into three pieces for coordinating the maxillary arch and ensuring suitable bilateral intercusp width against the mandibular arch. The maxilla was repositioned 2.0 mm superiorly and 2.0 mm posteriorly. The body of the mandible was advanced 3.0 mm at the vertical osteotomy line adjacent to the buccal groove of the left first molar on both sides by sagittal split ramus osteotomy. Postoperative orthodontic treatment was initiated 2 months after surgery and continued for 2 years to detail the occlusion. The overall active treatment time was 4 years. After debonding, a retainer was worn fulltime on both arches. Net movement of Pog was 12 mm horizontally forward and 1 mm upward, rotating 4.8° in SN-Pog. Net increases in mandibular plane angle and occlusal plane angle were 6.2° and 6.0° counterclockwise (T5), respectively. These data indicate that the position of Pog was greatly influenced by the counterclockwise rotation of the distal mandibular segment. All incisors were vital and no obvious recession was observed. Root resorption was never evident during treatment  nor was ankylosis seen. Pre- and posttreatment oral photographs are shown in Figure 7. Significant improvement in facial appearance was achieved and the patient was able to close her lips more easily than before at rest and without conscious effort . All cephalometric measurements made during treatment are listed on Table 1.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Cephalometric analysis.</u>\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Lateral cephalograms at each step in Case 1.

Case 2\n\n【27】A 17-year-old girl presented with a chief complaint of a lack of interincisal contact, crowding of the mandibular incisors, and mandibular retrusion. She had a severe Class II skeletal relationship with a concave profile. No clicking, joint pain, or limitation of opening was found on initial examination. There was no apparent condylar absorption or shortening of the ramus height. Treatment course and our original distraction method have already been described elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Briefly, the patient had a total arch discrepancy of −22 mm with retrognathia. The representative values were SNA, −3.4 SD; SNB, −4.5 SD; SN-Pog, −4.2 SD; L1-Mp, +0.5 SD; interincisal angle, −2.1 SD; OB, 2.0 mm; and OJ, 10.0 mm. The cephalograms taken at each step are shown in Figure 9 and superimposed cephalometric tracing is provided in Figure 10. These measurements are listed in Table 1. The same maneuver as in Case 1 was adopted, with some modification because of the length deficiency of alveolar bone. After making a basal foundation by advancement genioplasty, 4 mm forward and 2 mm downward, tooth-borne distraction of the incisal segment was performed to elongate the perimeter and improve the axis of the incisors. The change clearly appeared as a difference in the lines of T3 and T4 on Figure 10. After an 8-week consolidation period, orthodontic treatment was performed for another 22 months, and finally two-jaw surgery was performed after eliminating crowding of the anterior dentition. Substantial movement of Pog with proper incisor axis confirmed to the mandibular plane was achieved. The net increase in SN-Pog angle was 6.6° and Pog was moved 14 mm horizontally forward and 3 mm vertically downward. Postsurgical orthodontic treatment was started 2 months after surgery and continued for another 10 months. Desirable skeletal configuration was obtained with improvement of lip seal. All incisors were vital and no obvious recession was observed. Ankylosis was also not seen. However, subtle apical resorption of mandibular incisors was observed . All cephalometric measurements during treatment are listed in Table 1. Crowding of the lower tooth was markedly improved with the axis correction . Significant improvement in facial appearance was also achieved .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 9 | Lateral cephalograms at each step in Case 2.

Initial measurements were SNA, +0.7 SD; SNB, −2.0 SD; ANB, +4.0 SD; SN-Pog, −2.4 SD; interincisal angle, −2.4 SD; L1-Mp, +0.6 SD; OB, +4.8 mm; and OJ, +8.1 mm. The cephalograms taken at each step are shown in Figure 14 and superimposed cephalometric tracing is provided in Figure 15. With the first genioplasty, Pog was advanced 9 mm horizontally forward and 1.2 mm vertically downward, and SN-Pog was improved to 3.1°. About 17 months later, segmental alveolar osteotomy was performed, and interincisal angle was improved by 9.0°. After completing preorthodontic treatment for another 1 year, two-jaw surgery was performed. Net linear movement of Pog was 20 mm forward and 3 mm upward with the help of counterclockwise rotation of the occlusal plane by 6.9°. Postsurgical orthodontic treatment was started 2 months after surgery and continued for 1 year to detail the occlusion. The net increase in SN-Pog was 7.0°. Alignment of lower incisors was performed without any obvious root resorption . All incisors were vital and no obvious recession was observed. Ankylosis was also not seen. All cephalometric measurements during treatment are listed in Table 1. Intra- and extraoral photos are shown in Figures 17 and 18, respectively.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 14 | Lateral cephalograms at each step in Case 3.

Discussion\n\n【41】Successful attainment of treatment goals was accomplished through cooperation between the orthodontist, prosthodontist, and maxillofacial surgeon. We have been employing a team approach so far. This three-stage method of genioplasty, segmental osteotomy, and two-jaw surgery came up in our discussion of treatment planning and final goals. Indeed, skeletal open bite with mandibular retrognathia is one of the most difficult jaw deformities with malocclusion we have faced. Generally, surgical repositioning of both the mandibular and maxillary jaws is often selected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Although the jaw relationships and intercuspation are often examined deeply before surgery, the relationship between teeth and the alveolar bone in which they are planted does not seem to receive much consideration among oral surgeons, who may perceive this as the domain of orthodontists. In patients with retrognathia, the axis relative to the mandibular plane is much higher than the normal value of 90°. Prior to surgery, particularly in the lower incisor area, decompensation of tooth tipping together with creating a desirable configuration of the tooth axis in reference to the alveolar bone is essential for achieving anterior guidance. This is because these results are closely related to long-term stability and functional amelioration after surgery, irrespective of the perceptions of the patients themselves. Unless a solution would or could be reached orthodontically, it should be achieved surgically.\n\n【42】If periapical segmental alveolar osteotomy were performed, the basal surface of the dentate segment after osteotomy would be freed from the opposing surface of the body by rotational movement around the incisor edge and the segment would not be stabilized even with fixation. As for chin structure, it should be protruded enough to achieve good lip competence and an acceptable profile. To simultaneously overcome the problems of segment instability and retruded chin, the approach presented here was finally devised. The final situation at debonding showed better results than initially expected.\n\n【43】To improve incisor axis alone, Triaca et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> reported the desirable and reliable idea of segmental distraction of the anterior alveolar process using the hinged bone plate. To tell the truth, our team had deeply discussed application of this approach to the treatment of our patients, but we had to give up because the condition was quite different from ours in terms of the degree of protrusion of the original chin. Unlike the cases with strong chin described in that paper, all our cases had severely retruded chins, and we had to manage augmentation of the bone anteriorly. Supplemental genioplasty alone, whether performed with two-jaw surgery or secondary surgery at a future date only for advancement of the chin position, while leaving the original labially inclined incisors untreated, would never have achieved such a desirable configuration as incisors positioned vertical to the mandibular plane with protruded chin and anterior guidance.\n\n【44】One-stage treatment for a situation similar to ours has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, with alveolar bone osteotomy and advancement genioplasty performed in one operation. In that report, the authors mentioned that a 5 mm bone beam should be preserved to maintain continuity between the right and left sides of the mandible. However, this cannot always be achieved in cases with insufficient mandibular height and width in the symphyseal region, particularly in those cases with micromandible that need this treatment. Issues of volume have to be taken into consideration. The frontal part of the mandible receives large amounts of force from various directions, including distortional stress during jaw movements, and the risk of bone fracture must be considered. Furthermore, compared to Westerners, Easterners often have a small and spindly jaw. Our method was developed based on these characteristics and appears to be reliable from the perspective of maintaining continuity of both sides of the mandible and enabling step-by-step confirmation of the condition of the teeth and chin, including the influence of surrounding soft tissues, during treatment.\n\n【45】Distraction osteogenesis has also been adopted to overcome similar situations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. With this approach, lengthening the mandibular body and improving the mandibular angle and occlusal plane angle can be achieved. Incisor angle relative to the mandibular plane, however, remains unchanged. Fundamentally, appliance setting and vector control of the direction are much more difficult than generally expected and patients sometimes complain of discomfort wearing the appliance in a small oral cavity, so general utilization in every patient is not feasible.\n\n【46】Finally, another merit of this method was that obvious resorption of the roots of the mandibular incisors either was not seen radiographically or was clinically insignificant. This may be because the axis had been improved by the osteotomy and excessive force was no longer required for tooth movement. In addition, our previous experience suggests that bone will be somewhat tender regionally due to the remodeling process, and this characteristic change induced by genioplasty and segmental alveolar osteotomy might contribute to easy tooth movement and less root resorption when coordinating.\n\n【47】A comparative study to confirm any superiority of this strategy over other methods would obviously be desirable, but we could not design such a study because we could not essentially take other method than this method. We have encountered few cases with sufficient bone volume to undergo a one-stage method or distraction osteogenesis. In other words, we adopted this method in cases where other methods were not reasonably practicable. Above all, we deeply weighed considerations of safety and certainty. Taking all the factors together, our method is clinically useful for improving retruded chin and labial inclination of the incisors in certain cases.\n\n【48】As can be seen in the figures from detailed measurements, Pog was advanced substantially with the achievement of a desirable L1-mandibular plane. Cephalometric superimpositions between “before genioplasty” and “debonding” showed that facial harmony was dramatically improved. Incisors were placed vertically relative to the mandibular plane in the center of the alveolar bone. SN-Pog angle increased by +4.8°, +5.6°, and +7.0° in Cases 1–3, respectively. The chin was moved anteriorly 10 mm, 4 mm, and 9 mm, with genioplasty alone, and 12 mm, 14 mm, and 20 mm with the three-stage surgeries, respectively. Some measurements, however, remain under or over the normal range. We do not fixate on normalizing these values, instead aiming for a suitable situation in which stability can be maintained. Not all measurements can be corrected, because each case has individual characteristics. We refer to mean values and measurements but do not necessarily rely on them. Visual inspection may sometimes prove more informative than mathematical figures and numerical analysis. In other words, a good impression of the oral cavity at a glance suggests a reasonable structure on cephalometric analysis.\n\n【49】Patients with jaw deformity sometimes experience substantial mental distress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Orthognathic treatment carries with it a wide range of benefits, not only in terms of improved function and esthetics but also in psychosocial benefits such as increased self-esteem. This surgery is becoming more popular and many patients who were not previously indicated for surgery will undergo such procedures in the future. Clear treatment plans without unrealistic expectations are necessary for each patient. Before treatment, simple, nonaggressive therapies with an emphasis on high quality are also mandatory. From these perspectives, our method will be of benefit, because of the relative ease of handling and avoidance of cumbersome processes. Even though three separate operations are required, the outcome justifies the effort. We believe that this maneuver should be one of the candidates when selecting a strategy for cases involving retruded chin with labial inclination of the incisors, depending on the condition of the patient.\n\n【50】#### 5\\.

Introduction\n\n【3】A 59-year-old male patient was referred to the breast clinic with a breast lump underneath the right nipple. The lump was painless with no other associated complaints. On clinical assessment it was a firm, discrete benign feeling lesion, about 15 mm in diameter. There were no palpable axillary lymph nodes. On radiological assessment, both Ultrasound scan and Mammography showed a benign looking mass just lateral to the right nipple, with discrete well-defined edges . This measured 18 mm  ×  13 mm on ultrasound scan.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Mammography: Right breast CC & MLO Views: Isodense, well-defined lesion within the retroareolar area 1 8 × 1 3  mm in diameter. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【5】The patient refused to have a core biopsy, therefore, an excisional biopsy was done under local anaesthesia. Histopathology showed a 20 mm spindle cell tumour with pleomorphism and mitoses . On Immunohistochemistry, the lesion was positive for Desmin and Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) while it was negative for S100. All these were in keeping with primary leiomyosarcoma. The nearest margin was the superficial which was 4 mm from the tumour. Staging investigations were normal. Simple mastectomy without axillary dissection was performed and a residual disease was confirmed. The cavity wall confirmed the presence of a further 5 mm of similar tumour. A multidisciplinary team decision postoperatively was to keep the patient under regular followup with no need of any further adjuvant therapy. The patient has been followed up for 26 months without evidence of recurrence.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Histopathology section showing a spindle cell tumour with pleomorphism and mitoses.

Discussion\n\n【8】Sarcomas comprise less than 1% of all primary breast neoplasms and only a minority of these are leiomyosarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Sarcomas in the breast have been described since the early 20th century but most probably the first confirmed case of leiomyosarcoma on IHC was reported in the late 1960s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Though it was described as fibrosarcoma in the report, Munitiz et al. commented in 2004 that the pathological features on optical and electronic microscopy were in keeping with Leiomyosarcoma. It has been reported that only 25 cases in the literature are confirmed primary leiomyosarcomas of the breast proven on IHC or electron microscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Confirming the diagnosis on either IHC or electron microscopy is important as it is sometimes difficult to differentiate these pathologically from poorly differentiated sarcomatoid carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Diagnosis can be challenging because of the nonspecific clinical and radiological findings. Clinically they present with a progressively enlarging tumour. The presence of enlarged axillary nodes is rare making axillary node staging unnecessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. Radiological findings are also non specific. While some have reported a welldefined lesion that can be mistaken for benign pathology as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, others have reported malignant looking lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Fine needle aspiration cytology can be challenging as these tumours can be mistaken for poorly differentiated carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma, or other sarcomas such as malignant phylloides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. On histopathological assessment, Immunohistochemical staining is essential as adjuncts to differentiate leiomyosarcomas from other tumours and soft tissue sarcomas. These tumours are usually positive for desmin, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin and negative for S100 (neural tumour marker), cytokeratins, and epithelial markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【10】The cornerstone of treatment is surgical excision. Most authors advice either radical or simple mastectomy arguing that wide excision is associated with higher rate of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 7, 9\\]</u>. Conservative surgery with wide local excision and clear margins has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10, 11\\]</u>. Though axillary node dissection is not necessary, it has been performed in many of the reported cases because of uncertain preoperative diagnosis or if there were clinically palpable nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 10, 12\\]</u>. Long-term followup is important as some of these tumours have been reported to recur more than 10 years posttreatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In summary, this tumour is a rare tumour that can be a diagnostic challenge to clinicians as it has no specific clinical or radiological features. This emphasizes the importance of triple assessment in all breast lumps, even if clinically and radiologically they are benign. The mainstay of treatment is surgical excision with clear margins and longterm followup is essential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:09:33", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:09:56", "cost": 22.851}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:09:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:09:32"}

Pathological examination revealed that nemaline rods were found in all specimens.

We conclude that immunological abnormalities are present in the specimens of certain childhood-onset NM patients without autoimmune diseases. Further evaluation of the immunological changes is warranted in childhood-onset NM patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Research showed that immunosuppressive treatment is effective to adult-onset NM, which suggests that NM may also be a kind of dysimmune origin disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. However, little is known about the immunological changes in the specimens from childhood-onset NM patients without autoimmune diseases.

Case Reports\n\n【5】Four patients, one female and three males, with an age range of 6–12 years old (mean age 9 years old) were admitted to our hospital. The clinical manifestations were as follows: three of them with progressive hypotonia of both lower extremities, whereas another case with progressive hypotonia of limbs. The respiratory function of the four patients is normal. Physical examination revealed that the vital signs, development, consciousness, and intelligence, are normal. There is no atrophy of both sternocleidomastoid muscles. The following lab tests are normal: erythrocyte sedimentation, blood lipid, hepatic function, antistreptolysin O, C reaction protein, antinuclear antibody, immunoglobulin, antibody of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and syphilis. Abdominal ultrasound, ECG, color Doppler ultrasound, and cardiac output showed negative results. The creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level in one of the four patients was higher than that in normal controls. Myogenic damage of affected muscle was examined by electromyography. The four patients did not have family medical history or other immune diseases. Results from clinical, laboratory, and ancillary investigations of the four patients are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Results from clinical, laboratory, and ancillary investigations of the four patients (the normal value of CPK should be less than 183 U/L).</u>\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Pathological Findings\n\n【8】All muscle biopsies had been received in a fresh state from vastus lateralis of left quadriceps and were divided into two portions. One portion was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen cooling isopentane, and 8 μm frozen sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E), modified Gomori trichrome (MGT), periodic acid Schiff (PAS), oil red O, ATPase at pH 9.6, 4.6, and 4.3, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) alone as well as combined with cytochrome oxidase (Cox with SDH), myophosphorylase, amylopectinase phosphofructokinase, adenylate deaminase. HE, MGT, and ATPase stains are essential for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of muscle diseases; PAS, oil red O, NADH-TR, SDH, COX, myophosphorylase, amylopectinase phosphofructokinase, and adenylate deaminase staining were used to exclude glycogen storage diseases, mitochondrial myopathy, lipid storage myopathy, and so on. In addition, CD4 and CD8 immunostaining was used to examine immunological abnormalities in the specimens. Another part of specimens was fixed in the 2% glutaraldehyde and embedded with Epon812, 1 μm semithin slices were then cut for toluidine blue stain and made into thin slices for lead-uranium double stain, and myopathic features were detected on electromyography (Hitachi H2800).\n\n【9】HE staining revealed inequality of size of muscle fibers and a lot of atrophic muscle fibers and compensatory hypertrophic muscle fibers in all cases. In addition, some dark red uniform of eosinophilic matters was also observed between some of the muscle fibers . Dark blue rod-like structures or nemaline rods were observed under light microscopy with MGT stain, whereas abnormal red fibers were not found . Histochemistry of ATP enzyme staining demonstrated Type I fiber predominance in all cases of NM . However, we did not find any evidence of positive results when stained with oil red O or PAS. Necrotic muscle fibers were found in two specimens, and the immunohistochemical results of these two specimens showed that some CD4 positive cells and other cells were gathered among the muscle fibers , but CD8 positive cells were not found . Electron microscopic examination revealed characteristic rod-like structures were observed predominantly in the subsarcolemmal location but not within the myofibers, and their morphology varied from single rod to large aggregates. These rods appeared as lattice-like structures similar to Z-band material under higher magnification. No intranuclear rods were found in any case .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) HE staining revealed inequality of size of muscle fibers and a lot of emarcid muscle fibers and compensatory hypertrophic muscle fibers.

Although previous reports revealed that some of these patients present with dilated cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, the associated cardiac involvement was not found in these four patients. MGT staining and electron microscopic examination demonstrated that the nemaline body existed within the normal size muscle fibers and atrophic muscle fibers. Muscle fibers with nemaline body account more than 60 percent of the total fibers, and the proportion in each muscle bundle varied, which is similar to what is described in a previous report; the proportion of muscle fibers with nemaline body correlated with the time course of disease progress but did not correlate with the age of onset and the severity of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The cause of NM is not clear. Previous studies revealed that childhood onset nemaline myopathy may be a genetic condition with at least six different causative genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

However, the association between childhood onset NM and immunological abnormalities was rarely reported. In this paper, we found that necrotic muscle fibers were found in two specimens of the four cases. In addition, immunohistochemical results revealed that some CD4 positive cells and other cells were gathered among the muscle fibers. We concluded that inflammatory cell infiltration may be associated with the necrosis of some fibers, and immunological abnormalities were found in some childhood-onset NM patients without autoimmune diseases. Although we agree that childhood onset NM is a genetic muscular disorder, the immunological abnormalities may be also a characteristic feature in some cases.

While several cardiac complications of cardiac involvement have been previously described, the evolution towards cerebral stroke has been rarely reported.

The metastatic pathway to the heart is often lymphatic, but hematogenous patterns can also be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. From a clinical point of view, invasion of the left heart may be a life-threatening event, potentially leading to a number of complications such as obstructed pulmonary venous flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, cardiac tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, ventricular arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, complete atrioventricular block 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, left ventricular inflow obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, and myocardial infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Cerebral stroke as a result of systemic embolization from the left heart has been exceptionally reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> and may sometimes represent the first clinical presentation of the neoplasm.

Compared with the old Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification system, newer classification schemes such as the ASCO (A, atherosclerosis; S, small vessel disease; C, cardiac source; O, other causes) phenotypic system can facilitate the identification of the most likely cause by grading the probability of each factor and accounting for the extent of the diagnostic work-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This approach may be particularly useful when multiple potential mechanisms are present, since it reduces the prevalence of patients with stroke of indeterminate origin.

Case Report\n\n【6】A 76-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department because of left hemiparesis and dysarthria. His history was relevant for past smoking, systemic hypertension, and laryngeal cancer treated by total laryngectomy and tracheostomy 5 years earlier. His usual therapy included aspirin, losartan, and doxazosin. During the last 3 weeks, he had shown recurrent episodes of postural instability and paresthesia in the left arm. A brain computed tomography (CT) performed 2 weeks earlier had shown no significant abnormalities. At the current examination, chest and cardiac examinations were normal, blood pressure was 170/75 mmHg, heart rate was 77 bpm, body temperature was 36.5°C, and oxygen saturation was 95%. The ECG was normal. Neurological examination showed facial-brachial-crural left hemiparesis (NIH Stroke Scale = 8). A new brain CT showed an ipsilateral hypodense lesion in the left semioval center. The patient was hospitalized, and therapy with aspirin, methylprednisolone, ramipril, and dalteparin was started. An echo-Doppler of supra-aortic vessels showed subcritical stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and critical stenosis of the left common carotid artery with occlusion of proximal left internal carotid artery. An atherosclerotic stroke was diagnosed (ASCO A1b).\n\n【7】During the following hours, neurological conditions progressively improved. Routine chest X-ray evidenced a rounding mass projecting over the right upper lobe and extending towards the right upper portion of cardiac silhouette . Chest CT confirmed the presence of a large opacity with irregular borders, with invasion of the right upper pulmonary vein and extension into the left atrium . Transthoracic echocardiography showed massive LA invasion by a large, multilobed, highly mobile mass (48 × 35 mm) protruding through the mitral valve into the left ventricle during diastole . Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed LA invasion with occlusion of the right upper pulmonary vein and pericardial infiltration through the LA roof, allowing visualization of areas of vascularization and some regions of cystic colliquation within the mass . The stroke was reclassified as ASCO C<sub>1</sub>. On day 7, sudden right hemiparesis with spatiotemporal disorientation occurred. Brain CT showed new multiple, diffuse hypodense lesions near the vertex in the left hemisphere . After careful clinical evaluation, the patient was considered at too high risk to undergo thoracic surgery. On day 20, cardiac magnetic resonance showed a further increase in the dimension of LA mass with subtotal obliteration of LA cavity .

Similarly, a more recent retrospective analysis of 4668 patients who underwent surgery for lung cancer found pathological evidence of pulmonary vein and LA involvement in 34 (0.7%) and 25 (0.5%) subjects, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. LA invasion usually occurs by two main mechanisms, including direct infiltration of myocardial tissue by contiguity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18–20\\]</u> and extension into the left atrium via the lymphatics and/or the pulmonary veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21–28\\]</u>. Patients most commonly suffer symptoms related to lung cancer (e.g. cough, hemoptysis, and weight loss) or sometimes related to cardiac complications as the first clinical presentation. A limited number of reports previously described cardiovascular presentations secondary to systemic neoplastic embolization, including cerebral ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29–31\\]</u> or peripheral arterial occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Noteworthy, most previous reports of cerebral ischemia described events with typical contralateral presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 29\\]</u> or incidental detection of brain ischemic lesion by imaging techniques in asymptomatic subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30, 31\\]</u>. Although patients with metastatic involvement of the heart generally have poor clinical outcome, their management should include a careful assessment of surgical options. When appropriate, the treatment of choice is complete resection in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. However, in the majority of cases, cardiac metastases occur in patients with advanced neoplastic disease who have already undergone resection of the tumor of origin. In these cases, cardiac treatment is usually confined to palliative interventions to relieve cardiac compression or haemodynamic obstruction if indicated. Moreover, complete resection of the tumor is not always possible, and postoperative mortality is relatively high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33, 34\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In this report, we describe the case of a primary lung neoplasm extending into the left atrium via a pulmonary vein and complicated by stroke presenting as ipsilateral hemiparesis. Several atypical issues should be pointed out in this case: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the clinical presentation as stroke with left hemiparesis and CT evidence of ipsilateral acute ischemic lesion, which might suggest the presence of uncrossed corticospinal tracts in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the changes in stroke categorization according to the ASCO classification, related to the detection of left internal carotid artery occlusion with successive evidence of cardiac source of cerebral embolization; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the successive clinical evolution with sudden-onset right hemiparesis associated with multiple contralateral left-sided lesions, suggestive for an embolization pattern; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the growth rate of LA mass, which rapidly led to LA cavity obliteration and cardiac death. It should be pointed out that since tissue analysis data were not available, caution is needed in interpreting these findings. Although both the clinical course and imaging data support the hypothesis of a metastatic nature of the mass, without histologic confirmation, the diagnosis cannot be considered as definitively established. From a practical point of view, this report highlights the importance of considering the ASCO classification as a dynamic tool to define the phenotypic nature of stroke and of considering echocardiography as a cornerstone in the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of patients with clinical evidence of cerebral ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:07", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:20", "cost": 12.564}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:07"}

However, migration of the inserted stent can occur, either distally or proximally; proximal migration is less common, but it also presents a greater challenge for endoscopic resolution. We present a case of a 67-year-old woman who had locally advanced pancreatic cancer and developed a common bile duct obstruction. Upon clinical presentation of chronic, painless, progressive jaundice, the obstruction was managed by placing of a 10 mm × 60 mm covered self-expandable metal stent (CSEMS), which successfully facilitated palliative biliary drainage. Six months later, however, the patient developed recurrent jaundice, which was determined to be due to proximal migration of the CSEMS. Repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed, and initial attempts to retrieve the migrated stent failed. Finally, another 10 mm × 60 mm CSEMS was placed across the stricture site, inside the previous stent, which remained in place. The treatment resolved the obstruction and jaundice, and the patient experienced no adverse events.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Endoscopic biliary decompression via stent placement is an important modality for the palliative management of distal malignant biliary obstruction. The demonstrated longer stent patency of self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs), over that of the plastic-type stent, underlies the physicians’ preference for their use, especially for cases in which the patient’s survival is expected to be longer than 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Many different designs of SEMSs are available, and in use, worldwide; these include uncovered, partially covered, and fully covered SEMSs. The choice of the specific SEMS type to be used is made on a case-by-case basis, usually by the endoscopist, based on the biliary pathological characteristics of the patients, including etiology, location of the obstruction, and institutional availability of the various SEMS types. The potential of SEMS malfunction is related to postplacement events, including stent migration or occlusion, and SEMSs can ever lead to life-threatening complications, such as stent-induced ulceration, duodenal obstruction, and perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. For stent migration, many studies have demonstrated that covered SEMSs (CSEMSs) migrate more frequently than uncovered SEMSs (USEMSs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. To resolve this issue, endoscopic techniques, using foreign body forceps, biopsy forceps, or polypectomy snares, have been used for stent retrieval. Stents can move either distally or proximally, and while proximal movement occurs less frequently, it presents a more difficult situation for endoscopic removal.\n\n【4】Here, we report an alternative endoscopic approach for the management of proximally migrated CSEMSs that was successfully applied in a case of malignant distal common bile duct obstruction, in which the endoscopist had failed to retrieve the stent; placement of another CSEMS was performed distally using a stent-in-stent technique after navigating through the previous CSEMS with a guidewire.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 67-year-old woman presented to our department with a complaint of a 3-week history of progressive painless jaundice. Laboratory tests revealed no leukocytosis but mild anemia (hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL, reference range: 12.0–18.0 g/dL). The liver chemistry panel revealed the following: aspartate aminotransferase: 38 U/L (reference range: 0–32 U/L); alanine aminotransferase: 31 U/L (reference range: 0–33 U/L); total bilirubin: 18.8 mg/dL (reference range: 0.0–1.2 mg/dL); direct bilirubin: 16.4 mg/dL (reference range: 0.0–0.3 mg/dL); alkaline phosphatase: 252 U/L (reference range: 35–105 U/L); and carbohydrate antigen 19–9: <0.6 U/mL (reference range: 0–39 U/mL). A computed tomography scan demonstrated an ill-defined mass at the pancreatic head (4.0 cm × 4.2 cm in size) causing distal common bile duct and pancreatic duct dilatation . The tumor encased the superior mesenteric vein and multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies were also apparent.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Computed tomography scan showing an ill-defined, hypodense mass at the pancreatic head, causing upstream dilatation of the common bile duct (a) and pancreatic duct (b) compatible with the double duct sign.</u>\n\n【8】After the cytological assessment (using endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration) indicated adenocarcinoma, a locally advanced pancreatic malignancy was diagnosed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) was subsequently performed and showed a long-segment stricture at the distal common bile duct that caused upstream dilatation (1.5 cm in diameter, together with dilations of the bilateral intrahepatic ducts; Figure 2(a)). The obstructive jaundice was resolved by placing a 10 mm × 60 mm fully covered SEMS (Niti-S Biliary Covered Stent™; TaeWoong Medical Co, Ltd. Gimposi, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), which facilitated biliary drainage . The patient received palliative chemotherapy, consisting of cycles of a cisplatin and gemcitabine regimen.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Cholangiography showing a long-segment stricture at the distal common bile duct. (a) The stricture caused upstream dilatation of the distal common bile duct; (b) after the placement of a fully covered self-expandable metal stent.</u>\n\n【10】Six months later, the patient presented with complaints of recurrent jaundice and was referred for ERC. A computed tomography scan demonstrated proximal migration of the previously placed CSEMS , and the patient was scheduled for endoscopic intervention. In the endoscopy suite, the cholangiogram verified proximal migration and showed upstream dilation of the common bile duct . The initial attempts to retrieve the migrated stent endoscopically by using rat tooth grasping forceps (Rat Tooth Alligator Jaw Grasping Forceps; Olympus Medical System Corporation, Aomori, Japan) and snares (Captivator™ Single-Use Snare, Boston Scientific Corporation, Costa Rica) failed. As a result, deep cannulation using a sphincterotome (Ultratome™ XL Triple Lumen; Boston Scientific Corporation, Costa Rica) was performed by navigating a 0.035-inch guidewire (Jagwire™, Boston Scientific Corporation, Costa Rica) until passage through the previous CSEMS was achieved proximally. A 12-mm balloon retrieval catheter (Extractor<sup>TM</sup> Pro RX Balloon, Boston Scientific Limited, Ireland) was then inserted over the guidewire and inflated within the migrated stent to confirm proper location of the guidewire. Then, retrieval of the migrated stent was attempted by pulling the balloon back distally, but the attempt failed. Finally, an additional 10 cm × 60 mm CSEMS (Niti-S Biliary Covered Stent™; TaeWoong Medical Co, Ltd. Gimposi, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) was placed across the stricture site, inside the previous stent. Satisfactory drainage was achieved .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Computed tomography scan performed after the patient developed recurrent obstructive jaundice showing proximal migration of the previously placed metallic stent (a).

At the follow-up 2 weeks after the procedure, the bilirubin level was normal. The patient refused the recommended chemotherapy and passed away 5 months later without recurrent episodes of jaundice.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】The majority of malignant distal common bile duct strictures are caused by pancreaticobiliary cancers. It has been reported that up to 80% of patients with pancreatic carcinoma develop obstructive jaundice; unfortunately, most of these patients have advanced-stage disease at the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Endoscopic biliary drainage via biliary stenting is the most common approach for addressing the issue of obstructive jaundice and can improve the quality of life of the patient, regardless of the predicted cancer-related survival time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. SEMSs have gained popularity among treating physicians, as they have longer stent patency than plastic-type stents, which are prone to occlusion by microbacterial biofilm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Nevertheless, SEMSs harbor their own disadvantages; for example, USEMSs can be occluded due to tumor ingrowth through the mesh 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. CSEMSs have better patency than USEMSs due to their thin, nonporous membrane, which is located inside of their mesh and prevents tumor ingrowth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. The disadvantage of CSEMSs, however, is their lower axial force, which leads to an increased risk of migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Unfortunately, the multitude of studies comparing CSEMSs and USEMSs to determine which is superior for the treatment of malignancy distal biliary obstruction have yielded conflicting results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10, 12, 13\\]</u>. Adding to the controversy, a prospective randomized trial published in 2010 showed no significant difference in stent patency between CSEMSs and USEMSs for the palliative treatment of distal malignant biliary obstruction, but confirmed that tumor ingrowth was more common in USEMSs and that CSEMSs had an increased risk of stent migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Stent migration is a well-known clinical problem, affecting 1.8% to 11.5% of biliary stent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9, 10, 12, 13\\]</u>. When stented patients develop recurrent obstructive jaundice or cholangitis, migration should be among the first events suspected. Proximal migration is much less common than distal migration, reportedly affecting only 1.7% of partially covered SEMSs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Regardless of the migration pattern, several techniques for retrieval have been described in the literature, including the use of foreign body forceps, biopsy forceps, polypectomy snares, or Dormia baskets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In our patient, the initial attempt to remove the proximally migrated CSEMS was carried out with several of the commonly used accessories, all of which failed. Since the upper border of the migrated stent was still wide open, the endoscopist decided to abandon removal of the migrated stent and instead place another stent across the stricture point, using a stent-in-stent technique. No stent-related complications were observed in the patient following the procedure, including the most common complication, cholecystitis, which occurs in up to 10% of patients after SEMS placement and is associated with preexisting cystic duct lesions, such as cholelithiasis or tumor invasion of the cystic duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】The proximal migration of a fully covered self-expandable metal stent in patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction occurs less frequently than distal migration and presents a more difficult situation for endoscopic removal. The stent-in-stent technique is an alternative treatment approach in cases where endoscopist had failed to retrieve the stent.\n\n【22】#### Abbreviations\n\n| SEMS: | Self-expandable metal stent |\n| --- | --- |\n| CSEMS: | Covered self-expandable metal stent |\n| USEMS: | Uncovered self-expandable metal stent |\n| ERC: | Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:26", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:58", "cost": 32.256}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:25"}

At present, oxycodone has fewer adverse effects compared to morphine and is widely used for cancer pain therapy. The adverse effects of oxycodone are similar to morphine and include constipation, nausea, and sedation. However, acute abdominal pain is rarely seen. Here, we describe a cancer patient presenting with acute abdomen with stercoral diarrhea. A 54-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canal had been taking oxycodone for pain relief. The patient had taken oxycodone for several months and had never complained of either diarrhea or constipation. After an increase in the dosage of oxycodone, he complained of abdominal distension and constipation. After being administered a laxative, he complained of diarrhea and severe abdominal pain. He visited the emergency department and was diagnosed with acute colonic obstruction caused by severe constipation. He self-medicated with oxycodone at dosages of up to 180 mg/day, and this abrupt increase of oxycodone caused stercoral diarrhea. Finally, total blockage of stool developed, resulting in acute abdomen.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

The availability and consumption of opioids have increased, and opioids other than morphine, such as oxycodone, have become more widely used. These drugs affect three types of the opioid receptor and subtypes of μ receptors differently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Therefore, individual variations in response to opioids must be considered in the management of cancer pain. Oxycodone and morphine have distinctly different pharmacological profiles; however, constipation during oxycodone treatment also occurs like in morphine treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 54-year-old man was referred to the emergency department for severe abdominal pain and diarrhea. He had undergone radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canal six months before; however, he underwent additional radiotherapy again for recurrence of disease. He was otherwise healthy and with no history of abdominal diseases. He had taken oxycodone 10 mg daily for moderate to severe cancer pain in the ear. Initially, he did not complain of constipation, and his cancer pain was well controlled. However, the pain gradually increased over a period of several months, and the dose of oxycodone was increased to 80 mg. His ear pain then worsened and he suddenly became constipated. His dose of oxycodone was then increased to 100 mg, and he was given magnesium hydrochloride for the constipation. However, he self-medicated with oxycodone at dosages of up to 180 mg/day.\n\n【6】After five days, he suddenly complained of diarrhea, hence, the laxative was stopped. However, his diarrhea worsened, and acute, severe abdominal pain occurred 6 days after the development of diarrhea, and then he visited the emergency department. An abdominal exam showed a flat, slightly hard abdomen with normal bowel sounds. He showed tenderness in the mid-lower abdomen, but no rebound tenderness. Digital examination of the rectum was performed, and hard stool was detected. Abdominal radiography showed a large amount of gas in the colon, and a computed tomography scan also showed colonic gas and a large stool mass blocking the rectum . This patient was treated with hydration and stool extraction, and the abdominal pain gradually ceased. His pain is now well controlled by percutaneous fentanyl administration.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Coronal computed tomography scan showing the amount of colon gas and a large stool mass blocking the rectum. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】As mentioned above, oxycodone and morphine have distinctly different pharmacological profiles, however, constipation also occurs in both treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Thus, it is necessary to watch out and treat constipation in patients taking opioids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Until now, acute abdomen caused by opioids has never been reported, although ileus is sometimes seen in postoperative use of opioids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Acute colonic pseudoobstruction after colonoscopy in a patient taking low-dose oxycodone has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient, however, did not undergo colonoscopy. The mechanism of the acute abdominal pain after oxycodone intake in our patient is hypothesized as follows: depending on the increase in oxycodone dosage, slight constipation gradually occurred. After the administration of laxatives, watery intestinal content was being passed as stool; that is, stercoral diarrhea had developed. Finally, total blockage of stool developed, resulting in acute abdominal pain. The abrupt increase in the dosage of oxycodone to 180 mg may have caused this episode.\n\n【11】At first, the oral intake of oxycodone had not caused constipation in this patient. In addition, this patient showed stercoral diarrhea and this made it difficult to make precise diagnosis. The first step to accurate diagnosis in such a situation is to obtain careful medical history. If the patient with acute abdomen took opioids, especially with abrupt increase of opioids, clinicians should think about side effect of the opioid although he complained of diarrhea. Diagnosis for this condition comprises of digital examination and X-rays. After the diagnosis, general treatment for ileus and constipation is needed. Adequate hydration, laxative, and pain relief excepting opioids are essential. In addition to this, an enema and digital stool extraction are applied. In the present case, stool extraction by digital and enema was done under sufficient hydration.\n\n【12】The primary management to avoid the acute abdomen caused by opioids is an adequate control of the opioids as well as laxative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This is important not only for clinicians but also for patients. The second step is opioid switch. Fortunately, this patient’s pain is currently well controlled by a fentanyl patch, which has fewer side effects related to the bowels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Appropriate switching of opioids as a clinical maneuver not only may improve medication tolerance but also may avoid adverse side effects.\n\n【13】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【14】Oxycodone is used for successful cancer pain management and adequate analgesia without excessive adverse effects. However, constipation during its treatment may occur and inappropriate use of oxycodone develops abdominal emergency like our case.

In addition to oral scrapings and sputum, E. gingivalis has been identified in specimens obtained from the uterus, cervix, neck lymph nodes, and lung. It is rarely found in lesions of the head and neck. We present an unusual case of E. gingivalis in acute osteomyelitis of the mandible, following bisphosphonate therapy for multiple myeloma.

Introduction\n\n【3】Entamoeba gingivalis is one of seven Entamoeba species that commonly infect humans and is usually found in the oropharynx, where it is considered a commensal organism.

Case Presentation\n\n【6】An 86-year-old woman with a background history of hypertension, multiple myeloma, hypothyroidism, and osteoarthritis, presented to the Dental Oncology service with osteonecrosis of the right mandible, secondary to bisphosphonate treatment. She also had poor dentition, multiple abscesses, advanced periodontal disease, and gross dental caries. Her past surgical history included a right mastectomy for carcinoma and an open reduction and internal fixation of her right humerus following a fracture. The patient did not smoke tobacco or consume alcohol, and her family history was noncontributory. Surgical debridement of the right mandible was recommended in order to prevent septicaemia and prolonged hospitalization during the course of her chemotherapy, as well as prevent progression of the osteonecrosis.\n\n【7】Prior to surgery, her white cell count was 7.9 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>, with no evidence of systemic infection. She underwent multiple dental extractions, two quadrant alveoplasty, curettage of abscesses, and excision of necrotic bone from her right mandible. There were no postoperative complications.\n\n【8】##### 2.1. Pathology\n\n【9】A 2.0 cm fragment of dark brown necrotic bone was decalcified and submitted for histologic processing.

Discussion\n\n【13】An 86-year-old woman presented with osteonecrosis of the mandible following bisphosphonate therapy for multiple myeloma, and underwent surgical debridement and multiple dental extractions. Histopathologic examination of the necrotic bone fragments revealed acute osteomyelitis with mixed flora and organisms morphologically consistent with Entamoeba gingivalis.\n\n【14】Entamoeba gingivalis is one of seven Entamoeba species that infect humans, including E. histolytica, which causes amoebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscesses. Both protozoa, E. gingivalis and E. Histolytica, are commonly found in cytologic and histopathologic specimens. Diagnostic distinction is important and may have therapeutic implications: while E. gingivalis is susceptible to metronidazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, E. histolytica infection may require additional therapy, such as paromomycin, to eradicate intestinal luminal cysts. Entamoeba trophozoites contain a single nucleus and a variable number of pseudopods, which form clear bulges visible on light microscopy. The trophozoite feeds on bacteria and divides by simple binary fission to form two small daughter cells. With the exception of E. Gingivalis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, almost all Entamoeba species form cysts during the transmission stage; variation in size and nuclei aid in species identification. E. gingivalis is transmitted almost entirely through oral contact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As seen in our case, colonies morphologically resembling Actinomyces are often associated with E. gingivalis.\n\n【15】E. gingivalis has a small but prominent central nucleus (karyosome) with a peripheral rim of clumped chromatin (characteristic of the genus) and finely granular cytoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Morphologically, the trophozoites of E. gingivalis resemble those of E. histolytica, although the former are usually larger (10–35 μm versus 15–20 μm). Other features of E. gingivalis can be used to distinguish it from E. Histolytica 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>; for example, unlike E. histolytica, E. gingivalis has no cyst stage in vivo. The contents of the intracytoplasmic food vacuoles differ between species: the trophozoites of E. histolytica may contain erythrocytes in invasive disease, while those of E. gingivalis contain basophilic fragments of leukocytic nuclei and cellular debris. Though the nuclei of these amoebae are very similar in appearance, subtle differences may be apparent: the trophozoites of E. gingivalis have a coarse karyosome, coarse peripheral chromatin, and multidirectional pseudopods, while those of E. histolytica have a fine central karyosome, delicate peripheral chromatin, and a single unidirectional pseudopod. As in our case, E. gingivalis is often seen in the background of marked inflammation with abundant neutrophils.\n\n【16】Most Entamoeba species reside in hosts’ intestines, with the exception of E. gingivalis, which inhabits the oropharynx and is thought to be a commensal organism in humans. E. gingivalis is more common in patients with poor dentition, oral hygiene, or with immune suppression. In the largest series to date, Sefer et al. report E. gingivalis in 135 patients with various oral pathologies, including dental caries, parodontopathies, pulpitis, gangrene, and ulceronecrotic stomatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A recent study of the prevalence of E. gingivalis infection among 551 college students in Tangshan, China, demonstrated an overall prevalence of 28.3%; higher prevalence rates were observed among students with oral disease, poor oral hygiene, and those who did not regularly chew xylitol gum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Lucht et al. found that among 13 HIV-infected Swedish patients with periodontal disease, 10 (77%) had E. gingivalis in their saliva or dental plaque 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Moreover, E. gingivalis was the only protozoa identified in this cohort, and its presence was not related to the degree of immunodeficiency.\n\n【17】In addition to oral scrapings and sputum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>, E. gingivalis has been identified in specimens obtained from the uterus, cervix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>, neck lymph nodes, and lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. E. gingivalis is rarely found in lesions of the head and neck or in association with osteomyelitis. A search of the existing medical literature revealed a single case of E. gingivalis in a neck nodule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> following radiotherapy, and no reported cases of osteomyelitis, as seen in our case. Moreover, it is important to note that most reports in the existing literature are based on the morphologic identification of E. gingivalis, not molecular or culture methods of diagnosis.\n\n【18】Using light microscopy, E. gingivalis has been identified in diseased gingival pockets for nearly a century. Identification of the protozoa on H&E stains may be difficult. Special stains, such as Gomori-Wheatley trichrome, iron hematoxylin, and PAS, stain both E. gingivalis and E. histolytica, but these are nonspecific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Fluorescein-labelled anti-E. histolytica serum may distinguish the protozoa in stool specimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, as do highly specific molecular techniques. Trim et al. have recently developed a novel molecular biology approach to detect E. gingivalis in gingival pockets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. A conventional PCR (which used a previously described primer set specific for the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) of E. gingivalis) was compared with a new real-time PCR assay (which used a primer set designed to amplify a 135-bp fragment inside the SSU rDNA of E. gingivalis). The former detected E. gingivalis in 27% of diseased gingival pockets, while the latter detected the protozoa in 69% of diseased pockets. Interestingly, neither of the PCR assays detected E. gingivalis in any healthy gingival pockets. Trim et al. conclude that E. gingivalis is only associated with diseased gingival pocket sites and that the newly described methodology may provide a novel eukaryotic cell marker of disease status in gingival pockets.\n\n【19】In conclusion, we present an unusual case of E. gingivalis in acute osteomyelitis of the mandible, following bisphosphonate therapy for multiple myeloma. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of E. gingivalis in association with osteomyelitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:13", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:23", "cost": 10.467}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:12"}

Several complications of this infection have been reported. However, a spontaneous pneumomediastinum has rarely been described. We report the fourth case of this extremely rare complication in a 65-year-old male patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, discovered during his therapeutic management by a CT scan control.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】COVID-19, originally reported in December 2019 in China, is currently spreading worldwide. It represents a major challenge for intensive care medicine, mainly due to the high number of intensive care admissions, the prolonged stay of patients, and the increased mortality in the presence of comorbidities.\n\n【4】Computed tomography of the chest has been proposed as triage and diagnostic tool for suspected COVID-19 patients. Although many parenchymal and extraparenchymal abnormalities have been observed, the presence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum remains a rarely described lesion.\n\n【5】We present a clinical case of a patient who tested positive for COVID-19 with spontaneous pneumomediastinum.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】We report the case of a 65-year-old patient who was admitted to intensive care for the management of respiratory distress and who has no medical or surgical history, with no history of cigarette smoking and not under any treatment.\n\n【8】His history reveals an influenza-like illness, a fever at 39.2 °C, arthralgia, myalgia associated with a dry cough, and anosmia with the notion of contact with a positive COVID-19 patient.\n\n【9】On admission, clinical examination found a conscious, tachypneic patient at 24 cycles/min with O<sub>2</sub> saturation at 88% in ambient air and 93% under 2 L/min of oxygen at the telescope, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure at 120/80 mmHg. Moreover, the examination confirmed regular heart sounds and no audible breath, and there was no sign of right or left heart failure. Pulmonary auscultation found high-sounding gasps and sibilant in bilateral.\n\n【10】The blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.3, PaO<sub>2</sub> of 53 mmHg, PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 46 mmHg, and of 22 mmol/L<sup>−1</sup>.\n\n【11】The biological assessment found an aspecific inflammatory syndrome, with lymphopenia at 2400 cells/μL, C-reactive protein at 110 mg/L, and procalcitonin at 0.17 ng/ml, a normal hemoglobin rate at 14.8 g/dL, a normal kidney function with urea at 5.66 mmol/L, and creatinine at 8 μmol/L.\n\n【12】A chest CT scan was carried out objectifying bilateral, peripheral, and subpleural ground-glass opacities, with foci of band condensation , suggestive of an infection by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest CT scan in the axial section of the mediastinal window showing ground glass images with an asymmetrical peripheral arrangement under the pleural layer, producing a crazy-paving appearance characteristic of typical COVID-19 pneumonia.</u>\n\n【14】Our patient gradually presented with dyspnea at rest with signs of struggle associated with moderate to severe basal thoracic pain, requiring oxygen therapy with a high concentration facial mask reaching up to 12 L/min. Front chest radiographs showed a stationary aspect of the lesions with bilateral reticulonodular opacities especially basal and more marked on the right side in connection with an interstitial syndrome.\n\n【15】Faced with the nonimprovement of the clinical picture after a therapeutic protocol associating hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the patient received an immunoglobulin treatment at a rate of 1 g/kg for 5 days and then administration of two doses of tocilizumab 400 mg at 48 h interval. On the 16th day, a computed tomography of the chest was performed for a better study of the parenchyma (millimeter sections in high resolution with an injection of contrast product) revealing a spontaneous pneumomediastinum with no sign in favor of subcutaneous emphysema or pulmonary embolism .\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Chest CT scan in the axial section of the pulmonary parenchymal window showing a low-to-medium abundant pneumomediastinum (arrow) dissecting the large mediastinal vessels in a 65-year-old patient with COVID-19 pneumonia.</u>\n\n【17】The management of this rare complication was monitoring of respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure with analgesic treatment for chest pain.\n\n【18】The clinical course is favorable with a partial improvement in respiratory symptoms, and our patient is declared cured after 31 days and 2 negative PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs taken 24 hours apart.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】Since December 2019, a series of cases of viral pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus identified on samples of the airways named SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan in China and quickly propagated all over the world.\n\n【21】The main clinical signs during SARS-CoV-2 infection described in three studies by Guan et al. were associated with a fever higher than 37.5°C, a cough, sputum, and dyspnea, occurring in the first day of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Also, myalgia was frequent, and digestive signs, which may be inaugural events, were also reported, such as diarrhea and nausea/vomiting.\n\n【22】The chest CT plays a pivotal role in the triage of patients arriving in the emergency room, and the most frequent characteristic CT abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia are areas of ground glass, multifocal, bilateral, and asymmetrical. The involvement classically predominates in the peripheral, posterior, and basal regions. Other atypical CT signs appear in the form of pseudonodular condensations, sometimes accompanied by an inverted halo sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is rare in SARS-CoV-2 lung infection. Only 3 cases were reported to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. It is characterized by the presence of air in the mediastinal structures with no apparent cause (trauma and iatrogenicity).\n\n【24】Physiopathologically a spontaneous pneumomediastinum is secondary to an endobronchial hyperpressure (effort with closed glottis) causing an alveolar rupture and then gas dissemination in the peri-broncho-vascular space up to the pulmonary hilum and the mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The most common symptom of spontaneous pneumomediastinum is acute retrosternal chest pain, followed by dyspnea, while subcutaneous emphysema is not systematic. Treatment is symptomatic, and no specific treatment seems necessary. Oxygen therapy is not systematic although it would accelerate the resorption of pneumomediastinum (absorption of free air by increasing nitrogen concentrations) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. In the case of lung infections due to SARS-CoV-2, the virus causes the degradation of the integrity of the alveolar membrane because it infects type II pneumocytes. Consequently, the damage of the alveolar membrane due to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be one of the mechanisms leading to alveolar rupture and the appearance of spontaneous pneumomediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Our case represents the 4th case described in the literature and the 2nd case described in Morocco. Two hypotheses could explain the mechanism of pneumomediastinum in our case: firstly, the coughing effort, and secondly, the spontaneous rupture of the alveolar partitions secondary to the alveolar and interstitial lesions induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【28】Spontaneous pneumomediastinum remains a presentation rarely encountered in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19 and can potentially be an aggravating factor in the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Indeed, the association of a pneumomediastinum and a parenchymal lesion extended on the thoracic scanner witnessing significant destruction of the alveolar membrane. However, the occurrence of pneumomediastinum in a patient hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia requires close monitoring of the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:48:20", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:49:13", "cost": 53.293}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:49:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:48:20"}

We present a case of a young female with subacute symptoms of cough and progressive dyspnoea. On evaluation, the patient was diagnosed as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia based on her histopathological reports. However, her significant elevation of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels which drop after treatment with oral steroids, relapse, and clinical presentation pointed towards sarcoidosis as clinical diagnosis. Discussion. Here, in this patient, transbronchial biopsy was suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia along with chest X-ray, and the HRCT finding was also favouring the same. But in this case, we have also seen elevated levels of serum ACE which dropped significantly to the normal level along with a complete clearance of lesions with systemic steroids, and this favours sarcoidosis. Also, the recurrence was in different areas of the lung, and lesions once again responded both clinically and radiologically to steroids with a consistent drop in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, which again is a feature common in sarcoidosis. In COP, often complete clearance of the lesions is seldom seen, even though they do respond to steroids but not as dramatically as in our case. Also, recurrence of the lesion with BOOP at different sites is uncommon as it generally progresses in the same site. Conclusion. This case report suggests that sarcoidosis as a possible cause of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is worth considering with the mixed spectrum of presentation as in our case. And to our knowledge, this type of presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with sarcoidosis as an overlap disease is very rare, and this possibility needs to be explored by more series of such cases.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia earlier known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is clinically characterized by subacute or chronic respiratory disease for a duration of 2 weeks to 2 months. Usual presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia will be persistent with dry cough and breathlessness. Pathologically, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia was defined by the presence of granulation tissue in the bronchiolar lumen, alveolar duct, and some alveoli, associated with a variable degree of interstitial and air space infiltration by mononuclear cells and foamy macrophages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Various associations of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with many drugs, connective tissue disorders, hematological malignancy, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, infections, inflammatory bowel disease, inhalation injury, irradiation injury, and transplantation have been reported in the literature, except for an unlikely cluster of patients with association of sarcoidosis and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Summary\n\n【5】A 32-year-old female with no comorbid illness presented with dry cough and progressive dyspnoea for 3 weeks with no history of expectoration, fever, haemoptysis, night sweats, weight loss, myalgia, arthralgia, muscle weakness, or rash. Oral antibiotics were consumed with no symptomatic relief. She was a housewife with no history of exposure to mineral dust, silica, asbestos, fumes, and drugs.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed a healthy well-built female with a BP of 100/80 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and a saturation of 94% in room air. No pallor, clubbing or cyanosis, lymphadenopathy, oedema, or skin lesions were observed.\n\n【7】Initial laboratory investigations showed an elevated ESR of 90 and an elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) level of 83, as against a normal level of 52 IU, with normal hemogram and other biochemistry and electrolyte assays. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-dsDNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (C/P-ANCA), rheumatoid factor, and serology for HIV, HCV, and HBsAg were negative. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli and other routine bacteriology tests were negative.\n\n【8】The pulmonary function test showed a mild restrictive pattern. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates . High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest showed peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe . Bronchoscopy with brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies were done.BAL was found to be negative for malignancy. Cultures of bacterial pathogens and acid-fast bacilli were also found to be negative by GeneXpert. The BAL study showed endobronchial cells with alveolar dust-laden macrophages with acute and chronic inflammatory cells. Transbronchial lung biopsy was performed, and histology  showed air space consolidation with fibrinous exudation and polymorph and macrophage infiltration, along with polypoidal proteinous layer in the alveolar spaces composed of granulation tissue, with alveolar septa showing moderately dense chronic inflammatory infiltrates (Masson bodies), all were suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP).\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest X-ray showing bilateral interstitial infiltrates.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Figure 3 </u>\n\n【11】HRCT chest showing peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Low-power examination shows plugs of granulation tissue in bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 High-power examination shows Masson bodies that are rounded nodules of granulation tissue in alveolar spaces.</u>\n\n【14】The patient was treated with systemic steroids to which the patient responded dramatically with a clinical and significant radiological clearance  and a decrease in serum ACE to normal. Steroid was gradually tapered and stopped after 3 months.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 Chest X-ray showing clearance of bilateral interstitial infiltrates.</u>\n\n【16】The patient was asymptomatic for 5 months after withdrawal of steroids, following which her symptoms of cough and breathlessness reappeared. Chest radiograph and HRCT  showed recurrence of bilateral patchy lesions but in different zones of the lung. The patient was not willing for a repeat CT-guided FNAC and biopsy. The serum ACE levels again increased to pretreatment levels of 70 IU, and it again reached a nadir after another 3 months of a tapering course of steroids.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 HRCT showing recurrence of bilateral patchy lesions in different zones.</u>\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】The differential diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) includes diseases like community-acquired pneumonia, idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. In our case, with the persistence of symptoms and lack of response to antibiotics, we diverged from bacterial or viral pneumonia. We excluded the diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with clinic-pathological collaboration. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) has a similar clinical and radiographical presentation to subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. We excluded the disease because of the absence of a known exposure to an aetiological agent and the absence of poorly formed granulomas on lung biopsy. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia can have a similar clinical and radiographical presentation to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP). In chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, blood eosinophilia is usually higher than 1500/mm<sup>3</sup> and bronchoalveolar eosinophilia is higher than 25%. In our case, blood and BAL eosinophils were within the normal range. Also in histopathological patterns, a significant eosinophilic infiltration is seen, and the eosinophilic infiltration is often accompanied by foci of necrosis and proteinaceous debris, termed eosinophilic microabscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. With these findings, we excluded all other diseases and established the diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP).\n\n【20】In our case report, a 32-year-old female presented with dry cough and progressive dyspnoea with high ESR and elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, with the imaging study showing peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe and biopsy, suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with granulation tissue and underwent remission of both clinical and radiological findings on treatment with systemic steroids.\n\n【21】Here, in this patient, transbronchial biopsy was suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) along with chest X-ray, and the HRCT finding was also favouring cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Here, we came to the final diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia after excluding all other possible conditions as well.In the absence of other contributing disease processes, diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia can be demonstrated by typical histological features in the patients with a compatible clinical and radiological pattern.\n\n【22】But in our case, we have also seen elevated levels of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) which responded to oral steroids. The features that favoured sarcoidosis were that there was a significant clearance of lesions with steroids. Also, the recurrence was in different areas of the lung once steroids were discontinued, and lesions once again responded both clinically and radiologically to steroids with a consistent drop in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, suggesting a sarcoidosis aetiology to the disease.\n\n【23】In cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP), often complete clearance of the lesions is seldom seen, even though they do respond to steroids but not as dramatically as in our case. Also, recurrence of the lesion in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) at different sites is uncommon as it generally progresses in the same site. Distinguishing cryptogenic organizing pneumonia from sarcoidosis can be difficult. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia frequently occurs in 40 to 60 years, and sarcoidosis usually occurs in the age group of 20 to 50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Both entities may present with almost same clinical symptoms. The histological appearance of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and sarcoidosis differs as mononuclear cells and Langerhans giant-cell granulomas characterize acinar infiltrates of sarcoidosis, whereas cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is characterized by fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and granulation buds in the distal airways and alveoli. The BAL study will show mononuclear cells in sarcoidosis and mixed cell populations with a modestly increased lymphocyte number in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Since our patient had a significant clinical, radiological, and pathological overlap of symptoms which could not be explained by either cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or sarcoidosis alone, an overlap of sarcoidosis-cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) was a strong possibility.\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【25】In conclusion, for this patient, we came to a diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis as a possible cause of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is worth considering with the mixed spectrum of presentation as in our case. And to our knowledge, this type of presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with sarcoidosis as an overlap disease is very rare, and this possibility needs to be explored by more series of such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:22:24", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:22:38", "cost": 14.54}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:22:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:22:23"}

This report describes an advanced and unusual case of stage III peri-implantitis-induced MRONJ involving the right upper jaw which was attempting to self-exfoliate. A 61-year-old male patient, rehabilitated with the placement of two implants when he was still healthy, was suffering from metastatic renal cancer previously treated with bevacizumab, interleukin-2, zoledronic acid, denosumab, cabozantinib and nivolumab. He had been under treatment of nonsurgical therapy over a year, based on antibiotic and antiseptic mouth rinse, without improvement of oral conditions. Surgical treatment consisted of massive sequestrectomy and complete surgical debridement of necrotic bone tissues. The specimen was sent for histopathologic analysis, which confirmed bone tissue necrosis with no evidence of metastatic disease. Two-month follow-up revealed a considerable life quality improvement. Although this complication is well known, the uniqueness of this case is given by its severity, related to the administration of multiple antiresorptive and antiangiogenic drugs, by the natural response of the oral cavity with the almost complete self-exfoliation of the massive necrotic zone. This case is emblematic in highlighting the controversies in the management of MRONJ, which certainly require effective collaboration of the multidisciplinary health care team that could improve patient safety and reduce the risk of developing MRONJ.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a well-recognized complication of drug therapies for bone metabolic disorders or cancer, defined as a persistent bone exposure within the oral cavity for a minimum period of 8 weeks in patients without a history of radiotherapy in the head and neck region. Antiresorptive drugs, such as bisphosphonates (BPs) and denosumab, are successfully used in low-dose therapy to prevent bone pathological fractures in patients with osteoporosis and to treat other bone metabolic diseases such as Paget’s disease and in high-dose therapy to prevent bone metastasis in patients with cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】A recent literature review identified a wide range of medications classified as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, radiopharmaceuticals, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and immunosuppressants that have been implicated in MRONJ in addition to the drugs already mentioned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】MRONJ treatment initially involved nonsurgical therapy in mild cases and surgical therapy in severe cases, but currently, the indication for surgical therapy seems to prevail even in less severe cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【6】This article presents an unusual and extreme case of MRONJ triggered by peri-implantitis in a metastatic renal cancer patient under multidrug therapy.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Presentation of Case\n\n【8】A 61-year-old male was referred in October 2019 to the Academic Hospital of Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro by his family dentist for the evaluation and treatment of a probable upper jaw osteonecrosis.\n\n【9】His medical history revealed he was under treatment since April 2017 for a metastatic renal carcinoma with brain and vertebral osseous metastasis without jaw involvement. Additional medical conditions included arterial hypertension (treated with enalapril 10 mg twice daily), hypothyroidism (treated with levothyroxine 60 mg daily), and no history of smoking.\n\n【10】Starting from May 2017, he received interleukin-2 (500.000 UI) subcutaneously 3 weeks a month, twice a day for 5 days a week. From June 2017, bevacizumab (25 mg/ml), every 2 weeks, for 6 months, was administered. He had also undergone a monthly 4 mg infusion of zoledronic acid (4 mg) for 5 cycles which was then replaced, in December 2017, by denosumab (120 mg) every 4 weeks, until September 2019. Moreover, from May to September 2019, he also received nivolumab (10 mg/ml). Now, he is in treatment only with daily oral doses of cabozantinib (60 mg).\n\n【11】He had been on treatment of nonsurgical therapy over a year (amoxi/clav 875 mg/125 mg, 2 times a day; metronidazole 500 mg, 3 times a day; and antiseptic mouth rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12%, 2 times a day) without improvement of oral conditions. Periodic follow-up had not been performed by his family dentist.\n\n【12】At clinical examination, two implants placed by his general dentist in the upper right jaw were found, only with the abutments of a cemented prosthesis (this is no longer present in the oral cavity). The implant rehabilitation, not combined with normal teeth, had been performed, in June 2015, before developing renal carcinoma and starting medical therapy, with two-stage surgical approaches. A partially edentulous maxilla with a totally exposed and necrotic sequestrum in the right hemimaxilla was observed, and there were signs of active infection and purulent exudate with no evidence of fistula formation. Spontaneous avulsion of a tooth was detected laterally to the right hemimaxilla. No implants had been lost prior to decementation of the prosthesis .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Patient’s preoperative clinical condition: necrotic bone exposure and purulent exudate in quadrant I.</u>\n\n【14】Objective exam also revealed a moderate tissue swelling and an asymmetrical face aspect. The patient reported apparently spontaneous painful symptoms. Exposed necrotic tissue emanated a persistent fetor. The patient did not remember when the osseous tissue exposure had begun because in the initial phase, the exposed bone did not give any discomfort. There were no signs of other pathologies. Signs of peri-implantitis with clinical inflammation and peri-implant bone loss were detected.\n\n【15】Various radiological tests have been performed, and an X-ray of the brain has revealed the presence of various brain metastatic lesions.\n\n【16】Computerized axial tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction revealed an extensive structural destruction of the right maxillary bone  with fractures and continuous solution of the anterior, inferior, lateral, and medial walls of the maxillary sinus. The lesion also involved the hard palate, with bone detachment of the right maxillary arch. Diagnosis of stage III MRONJ according to American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) classification was done.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Three-dimensional reconstruction of CT scans that highlighted the detachment of the right hemimaxilla.</u>\n\n【18】Considering the severity of the clinical conditions, the patient received prophylactic antibiotic therapy with amoxi/clav 875 mg/125 mg. On the same day, the patient underwent surgery under local anesthesia.\n\n【19】Bone sequestrectomy was performed involving the entire right hemimaxilla held in place by inflammatory tissues. Removal of the sequestrum exposed the ipsilateral nasal cavity. Therefore, careful curettage was performed in order to remove granulation tissues and fragments of the residual necrotic bone.\n\n【20】The obtained surgical sample  was sent for histopathologic analysis, which revealed “compact bone tissue with morphological aspects coherent with the proposed diagnosis of osteonecrosis.”\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 The wide bone sequestration of the right hemimaxilla obtained after sequestrectomy.</u>\n\n【22】Medical therapy with antiseptic mouth rinse (nonalcoholic chlorhexidine 0.12% at least 2 times a day) and systemic antibiotic administration with amoxi/clav 875 mg/125 mg (2 times a day) and metronidazole 500 mg (3 times a day) for 2 weeks after surgery was suggested. The patient was discharged with strict advice to maintain a liquid diet for 2 weeks and an accurate oral hygiene.\n\n【23】After 2 months of follow-up, persistence of oronasal antral communication and presence of mucus (discharged from nasal cavity) in the postoperative site were observed . No further regions of bone necrosis were found, and the patient was sent to his dentist for rehabilitation with an obturator prosthesis.\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Patient’s clinical condition at 2-month follow-up visit: persistence of oroantral communication and presence of mucus.</u>\n\n【25】Unfortunately, the prosthetic rehabilitation was never finalized because the patient’s condition deteriorated, and he died.\n\n【26】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【27】MRONJ lesions induced by pamidronate and zoledronate were first reported by Marx in 2003 in oncologic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The risk of developing MRONJ and the response to treatment are mainly influenced by the type and dose of drug therapy, in relation to the patient’s primary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. With the recent development of antiresorptive medications and antiangiogenics used alone or in combination, it seems to be important to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to MRONJ: the evidence-based mechanisms of pathogenesis include disturbed bone remodeling, inflammation or infection, altered immunity, soft tissue toxicity, and angiogenesis inhibition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【28】The guidelines for MRONJ treatment, assessed by the AAOMS in 2014, suggested a conservative nonsurgical treatment for early stages (I and II) of MRONJ and surgery for advanced stages (III) and mild stages refractory to the nonsurgical approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Although nonsurgical conservative therapy could be successful to control pain and reduce infection, the high success rate of tissue healing was reported in literature after surgical necrotic bone resection and also in mild stage, improving clinical condition of the patient often expecting downstaging of the lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4, 7–12\\]</u>.\n\n【30】In many cases, surgical treatment of stage III MRONJ patients leads to oroantral communication in the posterior maxilla. The closure of these defects represents an additional challenge to the oral surgeon and is essential to improve the long‐term life quality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【31】In recent years, pedicled buccal fat pad (PBFP), combined with ultrasonic bone surgery and L-PRF, has shown some effectiveness in exposed bone coverage and soft tissue healing at the posterior maxillary region. This technique supplies a rich vascular source of adipose-derived adult stem cells that could contribute to the esthetic healing of mucosal defects, prevent further bone weakening, and maximize the success for prosthetic rehabilitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The treatment of patients with a medical history of malignant diseases and a high-dose drug administration is more complicated with a slower tendency to full healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【33】To date, many different surgical approaches have been proposed in the treatment of MRONJ lesions: laser therapy, piezoelectric surgery, use of fluorescence for the identification of healthy bone margins, and application of platelet concentrates have become important tools to minimize the invasiveness of surgical therapy and improve tissue healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15–18\\]</u>.\n\n【34】The patient described in this case report had a metastatic renal cancer treated with multidrug therapy. He was initially managed with nonsurgical therapy that could have eased the halitosis and pain, for more than one year, without an improvement of clinical conditions and with a worsening of MRONJ stage and quality of life. Association of BPs and antiangiogenic drugs leads to more severe and frequent cases of MRONJ than BPs alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Furthermore, the replacement of a zoledronic acid with denosumab is an additional risk factor for the development of MRONJ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【35】When the patient came to our attention, the surgical therapy choice was mandatory with the removal of the wide sequestrum.\n\n【36】This case is emblematic in pointing out controversies in MRONJ management according to Schiodt et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>:(i)Early surgical intervention on localized disease may prevent progression and the need for subsequent extensive surgery(ii)Accurate risk assessment with evaluation of antiresorptive and antiangiogenetic therapies is mandatory before starting MRONJ lesion treatment\n\n【37】In our opinion, the lack of interdisciplinary collaboration and accurate follow-up played a key role in the development of this advanced stage of MRONJ case. The role of general dental practitioners, maxillofacial and oral surgeons, and oncologists in this area must be regularly checked for oral and dental health and must be motivated before starting antiresorptive and antiangiogenic drugs.\n\n【38】Patients continue to be at risk of developing MRONJ with a significant detrimental impact on quality of life due to limited preventive multidisciplinary interventions. MRONJ-education programs and an effective collaboration with the other professional groups could potentially reduce the risk of MRONJ and improve patient safety 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【39】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【40】In conclusion, though surgical therapy already in the early stages of MRONJ might prevent the progression of the disease, a multidisciplinary approach to the prevention of MRONJ is essential to optimize high-risk cancer patient management and to improve quality of life.\n\n【41】This outcome, in addition to a better communication among dentists and other health care personnel experienced is the best choice both for primary prevention (improvement of periodontal and peri-implant status and restoration of compromised teeth) and for secondary prevention with follow-up in order to identify MRONJ lesions in the early stage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:52", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:48:11", "cost": 18.49}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:48:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:50"}

To date, fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the literature. We herein present a case of 59-year-old female with primary multifocal recurrent urinary bladder amyloidosis. The patient was treated with a new method (laser therapy) mentioned for the first time in the literature. After 18 months of treatment, the patient has no complaints. Our case illustrates a new procedure in the treatment of primary multifocal bladder amyloidosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous group disorder characterized by the extracellular deposition of eosinophilic fibrillar protein (amyloid protein) in various tissues and organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Historically, the term amyloid was coined for the first time by Virchow in 1854. In 1897, Solomin described the first clinical case of bladder amyloidosis (BA) at autopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. BA is most frequent in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> decade with equal gender preponderance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】There are two forms of BA: primary urinary bladder amyloidosis (PUBA) and secondary (commonly associated with chronic inflammatory conditions) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Gross hematuria with irritative lower urinary tract symptoms is the most prominent in PUBA. It may be easily confused with bladder cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. There are no standard management protocols of PUBA due to its rarity. Herein we present the first rare case in Syria of recurrent multifocal PUBA treated with laser therapy for the first time in the medical literature.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 59-year-old Syrian female was admitted with a 2-month history of gross hematuria associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. There were no systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, or rash). The hematuria was red in color, fresh, and intermittent with no clotting. She was diagnosed with PUBA 18 years ago treated by transurethral resection without follow-up.\n\n【7】The physical examinations were unremarkable. Complete blood counts (CBCs) and routine biochemical tests (renal, liver, and bone parameters) were normal. Urinary microscopic examination showed normal pH and specific gravity, with uncountable RBCs, few WBCs, granules casts, and presence of hemoglobin. Culture and sensitivity were normal.\n\n【8】Ultrasound of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder showed thickening and irregularity of the bladder wall with 9 mm as the maximum thickness . Intravenous urography was normal. Cystoscopy showed multifocal yellowish bladder lesions . The pathologic examination demonstrated extensive deposits of a cellular amorphous compatible with amyloidosis. No other abnormality was detected.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Ultrasound scan of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder showed thickening and irregularity of the bladder wall.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Cystoscopy showed multifocal yellowish bladder lesions.</u>\n\n【11】To exclude systemic amyloidosis, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were conducted which revealed no pathologic findings. Tuberculin reaction and tuberculosis screening in 24 hours urine were normal. There was no increased lymphocyte count and protein gap. Bone marrow examination and CT scan of abdomen were both normal.\n\n【12】After the exclusion of systemic amyloidosis, recurrent multifocal PUBA diagnosis was confirmed.\n\n【13】A new method in the treatment of PUBA with neodymium: yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) laser therapy had been performed. The laser intensity used was 25 Watt with pulse duration less than 3 seconds. The fibreoptic tip was placed 1–3 mm from the bladder wall using a spot size of 2 mm. The total energy was 23500 Joules.\n\n【14】After 18 months from treatment, the patient was normal without symptoms. She has since remained asymptomatic without progression of systemic amyloidosis. Follow-up cystoscopies performed at present have been normal.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】The underlying mechanism of the PUBA is still controversial. Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation results in infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells with subsequent amyloid fibril deposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not always useful in differentiating amyloidosis from other pathological conditions. CT shows thickening of the bladder wall, a mass lesion, or a filling defect in the urinary bladder which leads to the differential diagnosis of invasive bladder tumor or inflammatory lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Cystoscopy showed nodular or polypoidal lesions that mimic the appearance of primary urothelial carcinomas. The gold standard of the PUBA diagnosis is bladder biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【18】To date, approximately 210 cases of BUPA have been reported in the literature (over 22 countries; 60 cases in the UK). The current case report is the first report from Syria that described a case of recurrent multifocal PUBA treated with laser therapy.\n\n【19】In the literature, transurethral resection or partial cystectomy is the most used option for treating PUBA with a high rate of complication and recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. None of these cases used laser therapy as the first choice of treatment for the recurrent multifocal cases. Despite the wide multifocal lesions of the PUBA in the current case, laser was used for the first time over wide lesions without any significant complaint.\n\n【20】There are rare reports of conservative treatment such as intravesical dimethyl sulfoxide installation and oral medications (colchicine) in the smaller lesions. Laser therapy or fulguration has been used for small, localized lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Long-term cystoscopic surveillance with close follow-up is recommended in cases of recurrent PUBA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【21】In the current case, we recommend the use of laser in treating multifocal lesions of PUBA.

The clinical presentation of LS is highly variable with heterogeneity in the disease-associated symptoms of cerebellar, motor, and extrapyramidal dysfunction and common infections. There is no effective treatment for this condition; as such, the prognosis of this condition is very poor with death occurring within the first few years of life. In this study, we report the first LS case in Latvia with SURF1 pathogenic variants in two siblings. The difficulties encountered establishing a diagnosis for the first proband and the effective prenatal diagnosis for the second offspring that led to termination of the pregnancy are discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction and Definition\n\n【3】Leigh syndrome (LS), also referred to as subacute necrotising encephalomyelopathy, was ﬁrst described by a British psychiatrist and neuropathologist, Denis Archibald Leigh, in 1951 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. LS may be associated with deficiency—either isolated or combined—of any oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzyme. Underlying causes can be found in the nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Coenzyme Q10 deﬁciency and disturbed pyruvate metabolism are also known causes of LS. The clinical presentation of LS is highly variable with heterogeneity in the disease-associated symptoms of cerebellar, motor, and extrapyramidal dysfunction and common infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, in most cases, it presents as a progressive neurological disease with motor and intellectual developmental delay and signs and symptoms of brainstem and/or basal ganglia involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>. Brainstem dysfunction is the most frequently observed clinical manifestation of the disease.\n\n【4】The phenotypic heterogeneity of LS makes its diagnosis complicated, which is generally established through biochemical, radiological, and genetic evaluation followed by histological evaluation of the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】LS is the most common paediatric mitochondrial disorder with an estimated global prevalence of 1 : 40,000 live births, although it has a relatively higher or lower prevalence in certain populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. With a population of approximately 1.9 million (latest data compiled by the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, 2019), Latvia yields a small number of LS patients. In this case report, we present the first molecularly confirmed case of SURF1 LS in Latvia. Our report details the clinical presentation, the investigation process leading to confirmation with particular emphasis on the underlying genetic heterogeneity, and the available treatment options.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Description\n\n【7】A 22-month-old male child was referred to Children’s Clinical University Hospital in Riga from another hospital due to an episode of hypoglycaemia (1.6 mmol/L). His general health condition was evaluated as serious. He was the second child of nonconsanguineous parents and was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. Physical and psychomotor development was documented to be delayed.\n\n【8】Laboratory findings showed metabolic crisis—ketotic hypoglycaemia, abnormal acid-base balance, increased anion gap, lactic acidaemia 5.11 mmol/L (reference range: <2.5 mmol/L), and lactic aciduria 4993 mmol/L (reference range: 0–200 mmol/L). Physical examination detected a rash on the patient’s face and body, oedema of the face and both lower limbs, generalised low muscle tone, and hepatomegaly (+3 cm below the costal margin). His weight was 12 kg, and his height was 77 cm (−3 SD). Neurological investigation disclosed severe hypotonia, ataxia, and muscle hypotrophy.\n\n【9】The patient had feeding difficulties due to aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. As his health condition was considered serious, the boy was admitted to the intensive care unit where he developed a high-degree fever. Several blood samples were taken for microbiological diagnostics, and culture results revealed the presence of Gram-positive flora. Fluctuating elevated lactate levels were also detected in his blood: 5.11 mmol/L initially, then 3.29 mmol/L and 2.88 mmol/L (reference range: <2.5 mmol/L).\n\n【10】The patient subsequently vomited haematin several times and passed dark stools. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed slightly wider lateral ventricles and subarachnoid space; however, no specific changes were uncovered. Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) showed no significant deviations in metabolites.\n\n【11】X-ray of the lungs and abdomen and fibrogastroscopy of the gastrointestinal tract showed no abnormal pathology.\n\n【12】Due to the low free carnitine and elevated lactate levels in his blood, treatment with L-carnitine (100 mg/kg/day) and thiamine (150 mg/day) supplementations was initiated as an empiric therapy for an undiagnosed mitochondrial disease.\n\n【13】The plasma amino acid panel showed low glutamine, glycine, serine, and citrulline levels and slightly elevated alanine and glycine levels. The organic acid spectrum in urine showed high glutaric acid, 7.13 (normal: 0–5.3). Based on the biochemical findings, a diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type 1 was suspected and, consequently, the patient’s DNA was sent for sequencing analysis using a next-generation sequencing panel of 435 genes associated with metabolic disorders. The patient’s clinical condition significantly improved, and he was discharged from the hospital. Nonetheless, genetic follow-up and maintenance therapy with L-carnitine and thiamine were recommended until a definitive diagnosis could be made.\n\n【14】After discharge, the DNA test results revealed no mutation in the gene causing glutaric aciduria type 1 and did not uncover any known disease-causing genetic pathogenic variant in the tested genes. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing was subsequently performed, but, again, no pathological variants were detected.\n\n【15】Nine months later, the patient was readmitted to our hospital due to lethargy, fatigue, and ataxia after withdrawal of his prescribed medications L-carnitine and thiamine. Brain MRI was repeated and showed progressive structural changes and lesions in the medulla oblongata and mesencephalon although MRS was not repeated.\n\n【16】A further extended genetic investigation was initiated. Specifically, whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify causative variants. Two pathogenic variants in the SURF1 gene were identified: c.845\\846del, p.(Ser282Cysfs ∗ 9) (maternal), and c.752-1G > C (paternal). Based on these findings and the clinical presentation, a diagnosis of LS was established. The L-carnitine/thiamine therapy was resumed. Furthermore, riboflavin and coenzyme Q10 were added to the treatment regimen. Neurological symptoms regressed for a short period of time. The child is currently four years old and is slowly deteriorating. He has lost the ability to walk and requires support to sit.\n\n【17】In 2020, the patient’s mother was reported to be pregnant with a gestational age of 21 weeks +5 days. Foetal ultrasound at 21 + 3 weeks revealed a cerebral periventricular cyst with dimensions of 21 mm × 11 mm. Diagnostic amniocentesis was performed, and foetal DNA sequencing results revealed two pathogenic variants in the SURF1 gene in a compound heterozygous state. Taken together, these findings were interpreted as LS and the pregnancy was terminated.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】This report details the first SURF1\\-associated LS family involving a child and a foetus in Latvia, highlighting the difficulties encountered in establishing a diagnosis in postnatal and prenatal cases.\n\n【20】Loss-of-function mutations in the SURF1 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, nuclear type 1, which manifests as LS.\n\n【21】This is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterised by rapidly progressive neurodegeneration and encephalopathy with loss of motor and cognitive skills, often triggered by an infection, between about five and 18 months of age after previously normal development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient was 22 months old when he was referred to our hospital. His psychomotor development was assessed as delayed at presentation; presumably, his parents had not recognised prior indications of this. For the majority of SURF1 patients, the median age for the onset of first symptoms is 9.5 months and the most frequently noted initial symptoms are poor feeding/vomiting (frequently attributed to gastro-oesophageal reflux) and poor weight gain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Mutations leading to the disruption of complex IV are the most common cause of LS in Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The causative variant c.845\\846delCT in the SURF1 gene has been reported as the most common variant in European populations, and the variant c.752-1G > C has been reported in one LS family of Polish ethnicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. However, these two mutations have never before been reported in one patient.\n\n【23】Most patients with pathogenic variants in SURF1 have bilateral brain MRI abnormalities involving the brainstem and subthalamic nuclei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Nevertheless, there is still a degree of variability in their brain MRI findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The radiological features of our patient were not typical for LS. He had a normal brain MRI at 22 months of age, despite a severe clinical presentation. By contrast, most of the patients reported to date exhibited some neuroradiological changes by this age and altered clinical status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6, 13–15\\]</u>. It was only after our patient’s second hospitalisation, at 31 months of age, that the repeated brain MRI showed progressive structural changes and lesions in the medulla oblongata and mesencephalon. However, there were no alterations in subthalamic nuclei, the typical lesion localisation in patients with causative variants in SURF1.\n\n【24】Occasionally, LS-SURF1 patients may display atypical neuroimaging features such as diffuse supratentorial leukodystrophy, unifocal or multifocal infarctions, diffuse or focal cortical atrophy, or predominant cerebellar atrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. MRI is a key diagnostic tool in LS, but the clinical spectrum of SURF1 mutations is larger than previously thought and normal MRI findings, especially in early childhood, do not necessarily exclude SURF1 defects. The reasons for this heterogeneity in neuroimaging whilst retaining a phenotypic presentation in LS are not well understood. Having said that, considering that LS is the result of a number of different biochemical and genetic defects that affect mitochondrial function, one would expect to find some variability in the MRI findings amongst patients. In addition to MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) could be performed for patients with LS. Lactate peaks in the brain (significant peak at >1.35 ppm) or the CSF is a trademark of mitochondrial disease, and MRS detection of CNS lactate sometimes may be more sensitive than serum lactate measurement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In our case, lactate was not found in areas of the brain that appeared normal on MR images and the MRS investigation was not repeated.\n\n【25】The biochemical presentation of LS can include elevated lactate levels in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid and may indicate metabolic acidosis and hypoglycaemia in decompensation status. From previous reports, the increased lactate level in SURF1 patients ranges between 2.3 (reference range <2.5 mmol/L) and 7.3 mmol/L (mean 4.4 mmol/L) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Tissue hypoperfusion is the most common cause of lactate elevation; however, this is not particularly distinctive of LS as many other aetiological factors exist and many other metabolic diseases demonstrate increased lactate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Our patient showed variable results in serial lactate measurements, leading us to suspect a septic aetiology of his lactacidaemia. If lactic acidosis is present because of OXPHOS defects, parallel elevations in plasma alanine are commonly observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 18, 19\\]</u>. Therefore, profiling of blood amino acids and urinary organic acids would be worthwhile and may provide pointers to the underlying cause.\n\n【26】In many suspected or unclear cases, the first genetic approach is next-generation sequencing—gene panels, clinical exome sequencing, whole-exome/genome sequencing. In our case, we performed next-generation sequencing with a panel consisting of 435 genes associated with metabolic disorders provided by a private commercial company. However, our approach underscores that clinicians should pay special attention to the contents of conventional next-generation sequencing panels. The SURF1 gene was not included in this analysis, and so the appropriate diagnosis of our patient was delayed for an extended period of time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In paediatric patients with progressive symptoms, achieving a correct diagnosis in a short period of time is still challenging.\n\n【27】The aim of prenatal diagnostic testing for genetic diseases is to identify causative variants, evaluate the general clinical condition of a foetus, and provide an assessment of the risk to the foetus in developing the disease antenatally or in childhood. Prenatal testing is usually necessary and requested as a consequence of having a previously affected child. The most common abnormal foetal ultrasound findings associated with mitochondrial disorders include periventricular cysts, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and skin oedema with reduced foetal movements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 21\\]</u>. Periventricular cysts may be the initial in utero presentation in patients with mitochondrial disorders, although when a nonspecific abnormal foetal ultrasound finding is detected, it might be the only feature to suggest a mitochondrial disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The interpretation of prenatal testing and prognostic variants with regard to whether or not the child will be affected is relatively clear in those families carrying causative variants in nuclear DNA where mostly classic Mendelian rules of inheritance apply. All families affected by a mitochondrial disease should also be made aware of all the available reproductive options and alternative options for future pregnancies. Such options include gamete (egg or sperm) donation or adoption as an alternative to pregnancy. Techniques to reduce or prevent the transmission of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA mutations, such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, are already available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. In essence, we stress the importance of prenatal diagnostic testing of the foetus as the first step in diagnosing LS.\n\n【28】SURF1\\-deficient LS has been reported to have a more positive survival outcome compared with LS associated with complex I deficiency or LRPPRC mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Predictors of poorer prognosis include disease onset before six months of age, failure to thrive, brainstem lesions on neuroimaging, epileptic seizures that are difficult to treat, and a history of intensive care hospitalisation.\n\n【29】Generally, specific therapy for mitochondrial disorders is not widely available and no specific treatment for LS exists. The aim of symptomatic treatment is to manage symptoms and to improve the energy state by increasing and optimising ATP production, improving the efficiency of mitochondria and lowering lactate levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The use of coenzyme Q10, thiamine, and L-carnitine may decrease symptom severity in a small number of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Supplementation with group B vitamins, such as thiamine, which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, had a significant effect and led to neurological improvement in our case. However, there are only a few reported cases of thiamine-responsive pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-deficient LS in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. Thiamine responsiveness is more likely in patients presenting after 12 months of age than in those presenting with neonatal lactic acidosis and corpus callosum abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Based on our experience, it is important to start a therapeutic trial of thiamine immediately if metabolic disease is suspected since biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease can fully imitate the clinical presentation of LS.\n\n【30】In patients suffering from LS, a few case reports have shown promising results for a treatment with EPI-743 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>. This medication is supposed to enhance the biosynthesis of glutathione and to improve oxidative stress status, whereas lactate values remain unchanged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Enns et al. reported that patients with SURF1 defect had been demonstrating clinical improvement after starting EPI-743 treatment without side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Even though the results are promising, a single case is not sufficient for assessing the therapeutic effect of a currently unapproved drug. Drug effects need to be evaluated by randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.\n\n【31】Despite making major progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial diseases, the available therapeutic options are very limited. Thus, they remain a fundamental goal of the current research in this field. A patient’s quality of life can improve significantly if appropriate physiotherapy and pharmacotherapy for neuromuscular concerns are provided. Suitable feeding methods to prevent malnutrition and aspiration and treatment of fever and infections are further important approaches to improve the quality of life and reduce the stress of the patient and their family. Cardiology, pulmonology, and ophthalmology evaluations are valuable to identify the involvement of these organs at an early stage.\n\n【32】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【33】This report details the first LS case in Latvia with SURF1 pathogenic variants in two siblings. The difficulties encountered while establishing a diagnosis for the first proband and the effective prenatal diagnosis for the second offspring that led to termination of the pregnancy are discussed. Identifying an underlying genetic cause in LS patients can be challenging. However, it can be facilitated if clinical, biochemical, and radiological findings are carefully evaluated. LS is a rare condition, and many other conditions present with similar symptoms. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of LS should be considered for a child with delayed psychomotor development, weakness, eating difficulties, signs of gradual neurodevelopmental regression, and symptoms of brainstem and/or basal ganglia involvement, especially when the clinical deterioration and metabolic crisis coincide with intercurrent infections.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:12:12", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:12:29", "cost": 16.448}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:12:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:12:11"}

This is a report of a 51-year-old Japanese man with venous leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein. The tumor was found during a medical examination, and the patient had no symptoms. Computed tomography showed a 72 × 49 mm mass adjacent to the left external iliac vein. The tumor was resected en-block along with ligation of the external iliac vein due to strong adhesion with the tumor. Histological examination showed venous leiomyosarcoma, and its origin was thought to be a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein. The patient has remained free from recurrence at 30 months after surgery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Leiomyosarcomas account for approximately 6% of all soft tissue sarcomas, and venous leiomyosarcomas account for 2% of all leiomyosarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Venous leiomyosarcomas commonly arise from the inferior vena cava, pulmonary vein, femoral vein, great saphenous vein, and jugular vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A venous leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein is rare, and this may be the first report of this finding. Generally, the prognosis of leiomyosarcoma is poor. Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy can be performed to improve the prognosis, but their efficacy remains debatable. Only complete resection of the tumor is necessary for long-term survival. In the present case, there has been no evidence of recurrence at 30 months after complete surgical resection along with ligation of the left external iliac vein.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 51-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for abnormal ultrasound findings during a medical examination. He had no complaints or relevant family history. His past history included diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver. Physical examination showed nothing of note. Laboratory findings, including serum concentrations of oncological markers such as alpha fetoprotein, cancer antigen 19–9, neuron-specific enolase, and carcinoembryonic antigen, were within the normal range. A contrast computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 72 × 49 mm mass closely adjoining the left external iliac vein. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the mass was isointense with muscle in the T1-weighted image . A positron-emission computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed abnormal integration at the tumor site . These findings suggested that the tumor was a leiomyosarcoma probably derived from the left external iliac vein.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the tumor (T) was isointense with muscle (M) in the T1-weighted image. The tumor adjoins the left external iliac vein (arrow). (b) Positron-emission computed tomography scan showed abnormal integration at the tumor site.</u>\n\n【7】Before surgery, we discussed with the vascular surgeons how to deal with the left iliac vein. In general, blood vessel reconstruction and subsequent anticoagulation therapy are performed. However, the patient was engaged in physical labor and did not want to take an anticoagulant after surgery. So, we finally decided to perform combined resection of the left iliac vein with the tumor. Extirpation of the tumor was performed. We could easily peel the tumor from surrounding tissue except at the left external iliac vein where, as predicted, the tumor was strongly adhered. Therefore, complete tumor resection was achieved by combined resection of the external iliac vein.\n\n【8】Pathological examination revealed a gross, well-defined, firm tumor of 60-mm at the greatest diameter. The cut surface was gray-white with a whorled appearance. Microscopically, the tumor was mostly composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with a mild to moderate degree of cellular pleomorphism and was considered to be a low-grade leiomyosarcoma. Furthermore, there were focal areas of high cellularity and bizarre nuclei . Immunostaining for α\\-SMA  was positive, and that for S-100, c-kit, and DOG-1 were negative. The positive ratio of MIB-1 was low at 5–10% . Contrary to expectation, the tumor was separated from external iliac vein, where only fibrous adhesions without infiltration were present . There was a thick blood vessel in the tumor that was thought to be a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein . Its vessel intima was preserved, and immunochemical staining for CD31 was positive . However, the tunica media and tunica externa of this vascular wall were diminished and completely replaced by tumor cells . Therefore, we definitively diagnosed venous leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) There were areas with high cellularity and bizarre nuclei.

However, the painful swelling of his left thigh improved one week later and ultimately disappeared by about 3 months after surgery. The patient has remained free from recurrence at 30 months after surgery.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Vascular leiomyosarcomas usually arise from a vein, approximately 5 times more often than from an artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. A preference for the female sex has been reported: 82.6% of all patients are female, and leiomyosarcomas usually appear around 50–60 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Primary venous leiomyosarcomas arise from vascular smooth muscle cells, and the growth pattern may progress from intramural to endoluminal, extraluminal, or mixed forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. The endoluminal pattern has a worse prognosis than the extraluminal pattern because of its high rate of metastasis.\n\n【14】Standard treatment for vascular leiomyosarcoma is surgical resection, and 40–60% of patients undergo surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Optimal treatments with chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not yet been established. When curative surgical resection is performed, the rates of 3- and 5-year survival are 76% and 33%, respectively. If a curative operation is not performed, the prognosis is bad 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, an aggressive surgical approach assuring a free en-bloc tumor resection can be curative despite a reported local recurrence rate of 53.7% in selected cases at an average of 25 months after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 9, 10\\]</u>. In our investigation, we found a few reports of leiomyosarcomas arising from the external iliac vein, but no report of leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of this vein. These reports showed that such leiomyosarcomas may have a relatively good prognosis. The reason for this may be that the tumor growth pattern likely progresses from intramural to extraluminal. When the tumor progresses endoluminally, symptoms such as leg pain, swelling, and leg numbness appear immediately due to constriction of the external iliac vein. For this reason, a leiomyosarcoma originating from the external iliac vein can be detected early and the patient can undergo a curative operation; thus, their prognosis is relatively good.\n\n【15】In most of the reports of vascular leiomyosarcomas originating from the external iliac vein, blood vessel reconstruction was performed. However, a recent report revealed that blood vessel reconstruction had a higher incidence of thrombosis while providing no additional benefit in reducing symptomatic extremity edema compared to ligation in patients with isolated external iliac vein injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Furthermore, patients who underwent blood vessel reconstruction must permanently take anticoagulants. We ligated the left external iliac vein in our patient immediately after surgery; although he suffered left leg pain and swelling, it had resolved by 3 months later. He does not take anticoagulants. Thus, ligation of the external iliac vein as curative surgery for vascular leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the external iliac vein may be one viable treatment option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:48:40", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:15:47", "cost": 1627.681}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:15:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:48:39"}

Diagnosis based on bronchial washing cytology is rarely reported because this tumor is usually lined by normal mucosa. A 35-year-old woman was referred to our center as a case of unresponsive asthma and hemoptysis for the past year. CT scan showed tracheal mass. Bronchoscopy was done followed by bronchial washing cytology and biopsy. Cytology smears revealed sheets and three-dimensional clusters of small cells, and some of them arranged around hyaline mucoid globules. Cell block and biopsy showed classic pathological findings of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the airways can be manifested with nonspecific symptoms and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of airway diseases and asthma. This tumor is rarely seen in the bronchial washing specimen. Characteristic cytological findings and using cell block preparation differentiate adenoid cystic carcinoma from other tumors.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The incidence of primary tracheal tumors is infrequent. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a malignant tumor that mainly arises from major and minor salivary glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】ACC of the lung arises from bronchial glands and mostly appears in the trachea and main bronchi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. It is a rare disease and constitutes about 0.04–0.2% of the primary lung tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the past, this tumor was called bronchial adenoma, which is a wrong terminology because ACC is not a benign tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】There is limited epidemiologic data about ACC of the lung. Based on few studies, the mean age is 46 years (range of 22–73 years) and male to female incidence ratio is different in various studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Symptoms are nonspecific, including cough, shortness of breath, and occasionally hemoptysis. Some patients might be misdiagnosed as asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Characteristic findings for ACC are not reported in CT scan or bronchoscopy, and thus the diagnosis is based on pathology.\n\n【6】Fine needle aspiration cytology is a routine method for sampling of ACC of salivary glands, but it is used rarely in airways. Bronchial washing and brushing is the popular cytology method in airways and the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【7】In the trachea and bronchi, ACC is usually covered by intact mucosa, and tumor cells are not found in bronchial cytology specimens. In rare cases, tumor invades to overlying mucosa, and tumor cells can be seen in bronchial washing or bronchial brushing specimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【9】A 35-year-old female presented with cough and shortness of breath for the past year. She was treated as asthma but did not respond, and hemoptysis appeared. CT scan was performed, and soft tissue mass arising from the posterior and lateral wall of the trachea with mediastinum extension was reported. The patient was undergoing bronchoscopy, and tracheal mass 3 cm above carina with invasion to the lateral wall of trachea was detected. Bronchial washing and biopsy were performed.\n\n【10】Alcohol-fixed smears from the bronchial washing specimen were prepared.\n\n【11】Smears were stained with the modified Papanicolaou method. Cytology showed hypercellular smears composed of loosely cohesive sheets, three-dimensional clusters, and dispersed cells. Cells were relatively small and uniform with round nuclei, small nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm. Throughout the smears, acellular hyaline materials with globule formation in different sizes were seen, and some of them were enveloped by tumor cells .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Cytology smears.

The patient was undergoing resection surgery, but unfortunately, complete resection was not possible, and then she was referred for radiotherapy.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lung is a rare disease and presents with nonspecific symptoms. It can be misdiagnosed as asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Imaging and bronchoscopy cannot differentiate ACC from other tumors such as carcinoid tumor or squamous cell carcinoma, and final diagnosis was based on pathology. In most cases, bronchial cytology is negative because the tumor is covered by intact mucosa. Sometimes overlying mucosa is ulcerated and makes the diagnosis based on bronchial washing cytology possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>. Cytology smears show monolayer sheets, three-dimensional clusters, and many isolated cells. Tumor cells are small and uniform with round nuclei, small nucleoli, and minimal cytoplasm. In the background, acellular hyaline materials and spherical globules are seen. Some of these hyaline globules are surrounded by tumor cells; this finding is a significant diagnostic feature of ACC. Using the cell block shows characteristic features of ACC, including tubular structures and a cribriform pattern with acidophilic materials and facilitates the diagnosis of ACC.\n\n【20】Carcinoid tumor and small cell carcinoma are made of small cells; therefore, they are in differential diagnosis with ACC in cytology. Characteristic granular chromatin and absence of hyaline globules favor carcinoid tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Features of small cell carcinoma, including granular chromatin, crush artifact, necrosis, and apoptotic bodies, are absent in ACC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Tumor cells surrounding hyaline materials may be misdiagnosed as true glands, so well-differentiated adenocarcinoma enters in the differential diagnosis. Cytonuclear atypia of adenocarcinoma and absence of hyaline globules differentiates it from ACC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】The incidence of ACC in the trachea is infrequent, but it is crucial to consider this tumor if a patient does not respond to antiasthmatic therapy.

We report a case of vascular graft infection due to Listeria monocytogenes as an example of a less well-known manifestation of listeriosis and focus on the possible treatment procedures emphasizing a management with surgical debridement but preservation of the endograft, in contrast to the gold standard treatment of vascular graft infections which consists of a removal of the graft.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The awareness of Listeria monocytogenes as a pathogen in meningitis in immunosuppressed or elderly patients is high. Also gastroenteritis, infections in pregnancy or sepsis in neonates are well-known clinical manifestations due to Listeria. However, this pathogen can cause many other types of infection. As an example, we report here the so-far 8th case of vascular graft infection due to Listeria, where in general organisms like Staphylococci, E. coli, or Streptococci are found. Our aim is to increase the awareness of Listeria as a pathogen causing other clinical syndromes in immunosuppressed patients over and above meningitis and gastroenteritis, and we focus on the treatment options in prosthetic graft infection due to Listeria reviewing the so far reported 7 cases.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 59-year-old man was referred to our hospital in August 2007 because of a progression of his chronic low back pain which began at the beginning of May 2007 accompanied by recurrent episodes of fever. The fever occured a few weeks later at the end of May 2007, and because of a temperature of 39°C the general practitioner treated the patient empirically with a 10-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanate. After that, the fever disappeared for a few weeks, but new episodes of fever and pain attacks occurred in July and August 2007. During this time, the C-reactive protein level was rising to 250 mg/l at admission (standard value <5 mg/l). The patient was under immunosuppression with Ciclosporine A and Mycophenolate-Mofetile after renal transplantation 2004, and he got an endovascular repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm with a Talent-graft in 2005. At admission, the patient’s low back pain and fluctuating fever were interpreted as a sacroileitis. A MRI-scan showed no skeletal pathology but a slight enhancement of the sclerotic infrarenal aorta including an enhancement of the periaortal tissue. So, a CT guided translumbar needle aspiration of the enhancing structure was taken, and the cultures yielded growth of Listeria monocytogenes, whereas the blood cultures remained negative. Therefore, the patient was treated with ampicillin 2 gm q4h intravenously without gentamicin because of his impaired renal function .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Sagital view of preoperative MRI-scan showing a retroaortal fluid collection with slight enhancement reaching to the dorsal part of the prosthetic endograft. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】Under this antibiotic treatment, the CRP-level sank initially, but remained then around 120 mg/l so that gentamicin 1 mg/kg i.v. three times a day was added. At this time, the surgeon refused a surgical approach since the renal transplant was vasculated through the graft and a removal of the graft would have been a high risk for the transplanted organ. After 6 weeks of combined antibiotic therapy a new MRI showed new collections around the vascular graft down to the psoas muscle. A drainage delivered pure pus, the cultures were sterile but an in-house eubacterial PCR (16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis) was positive for Listeria. So after 2 months of conservative treatment a surgical approach was faced due to lacking improvement. Intraoperatively extensive inflammatory adhesions were found; therefore, the aneurysm with the endograft could not be removed. Only a debridement around the aneurysm and in the psoas muscle could be performed. The Mycophenolate-Mofetil dosing was reduced at that time. Two weeks thereafter and after 8 weeks of combined intravenous antibiotic therapy the patient could be discharged with an oral regimen consisting of 320 mg trimethoprim/1600 mg sulfamethoxazole twice a day. A MRI-scan 6 months later in June 2008 showed no more abscesses but a slight enhancement in the periaortic tissue as well as in the psoas muscle. In January 2009, the CRP achieved a normal level (<5 mg/l), and, in July 2009, there was no more enhancement in the MRI-scan. Nevertheless, we decided to continue the antibiotic treatment for another 2 years (until July 2011) since the patient has a stable function of his renal transplant and since a relapse of the graft infection would be disastrous for the whole situation of the patient. In March 2011, the patient is well without any symptoms.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】A prosthetic graft infection is a very rare (0.6% to 3%) but serious complication after aneurysm repair with a high mortality (25% to 88%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Although there are no guidelines, the gold standard in treatment consists of a complete excision of the graft, reconstruction of an extra-anatomic bypass, and an antibiotic treatment for several weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 11\\]</u>. Generally, organisms like Staphylococci or gramnegative enteric organisms as E. coli are responsible for prosthetic graft infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Graft infections due to Listeria are extremely rare. Including our case, only 8 cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. In general, Listeria monocytogenes is an uncommon cause of severe illness. Healthy hosts may develop self-limited febrile gastroenteritis, whereas patients with risk factors are prone for invasive disease. Risk factors are the extremes of age (neonates and elderly persons >60 years), pregnancy, and especially impaired cellular immunity as in organ transplant recipients or patients with hematologic malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. According to that, five of the eight vascular graft infections due to Listeria occurred in patients showing at least one of the reported risk factors like age (case no. 1, 6, 7) or immunosuppression (case no. 3, 8) . Our case is the only case of Listerial graft infection in a solid organ transplanted patient.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of the 8 so-far reported graft infections due to Listeria monocytogenes.</u>\n\n【11】In the 8 analysed cases, with one exception, the mean interval between graft implantation and onset of infection was 2 years (range 12 weeks to 10 years), indicating a hematogeneous spread of infection. Listeria occur ubiquitous are mainly ingested with contaminated food, and invasive disease evolves by hematogeneous spread from the gut 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. 1–5% of healthy individuals are asymptomatic intestinal carriers of Listeria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This was presumably also the way our patient achieved the graft infection, but it was not possible to determine the source where he ingested Listeria. He did not report having eaten raw milk or soft cheese nor did he purchase food from delicatessen counters regularly. As a chemist, he did not have any risk by profession like, for example, farmers who are in direct contact to cattle which are possible carriers of Listeria as well. Only 5% of all cases of Listeriosis occur in outbreaks. In Switzerland, the last outbreak was in 2005 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> but in an area far from where the patient lived. Apart from his immunosuppression due to the renal transplantation, our patient did not have any further risk factors for Listeriosis as for example described by Fernàndez-Sebé et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> for solid-organ transplant recipients: no diabetes mellitus, no history of CMV-disease, or high-dose steroid therapy in the preceding 6 months. As reported by Stamm et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, Listeriosis in renal transplant recipients in particular occured in 75% during the first year after transplantation. In our case, the manifestation of the infection was 4 years after transplantation, but the moment of acquisition remains unclear.\n\n【12】The diagnosis of graft infections can be extremely challenging. Symptoms are often nonspecific like recurrent fever and chills or back pain as it was in our case. With a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 85% CT-scan is considered the diagnostic test of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>, but since it cannot distinguish sterile fluid from perigraft abscedation, PET/CT seems to be a promising method. Blood cultures are only positive in 21%, cultures of drain production or of the prosthesis itself in 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Considering the 8 reported cases with Listerial graft infections blood cultures were taken in only 5 of the 8 patients and were positive in three of the five. An aspirate of the perigraft fluid was taken in 6 of the cases, and all of the samples showed growth of listeria. This fact points out that culturing perigraft fluid seems to have a considerably higher sensitivity compared to the 50% reported by Saleem et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【13】With regard to the treatment strategy, persistence or recurrence of the infection was observed in both with (case no. 2) and without (cases no. 4–8) initial removal of the prosthesis , where at the gold standard of treatment consists of an early removal of the graft. Antibiotic therapy alone was initially tried in 6 of the 8 cases, but was successful in only two patients (cases no. 3, 4). In one case a percutaneous drainage was finally successful (no. 7), and in our case (no. 8), a surgical debridement without graft removal was successful in the end . So, we conclude and agree with Saleem et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u> that in patients with a high perioperative risk, a preservation of the endograft together with a prolonged and high-dose antimicrobial therapy combined with radiological drainage or surgical debridement but without graft removal is a possible treatment option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:35:56", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:36:06", "cost": 9.7}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:36:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:35:56"}

The patient was a 67-year old man who received 70 Gy radiation therapy to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Eight years later, he suffered a pathological fracture of the right clavicle. One year after the fracture, surgical treatment was performed due to persistent pain and weakness. Radiographs demonstrated atrophic nonunion. Bone scan demonstrated hot uptake at both ends of the fractured bone. MRI demonstrated a formation of pseudoarthrosis with fluid collection and suggested bone marrow edema at both ends of the fracture fragments. In surgery, fibrous pseudoarthrosis tissue was excised and both ends of the fracture fragments were refreshed to identify bleeding. Open reduction and internal fixation using a 7-hole locking plate and autologous bone grafting were performed. Successful bony union was obtained 1 year postoperatively, and no adverse events were observed up to 52 months after the operation. Our case suggests that a locking plate provides sufficient fixation and autologous bone grafting is effective in enhancing bone healing in a radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle in which it is difficult to achieve bony union.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

All types of cells can be injured or killed by radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, and management of fractures caused by radiation is generally considered to be difficult due to the biologically inactive bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A high nonunion rate has been reported in the past literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. There are only two reports written in English that describe open reduction and internal fixation using a plate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Locking plate is a new technology, which provides excellent angular stability even in poor-quality bone, such as in osteoporosis patients, and can avoid the deterioration of periosteal circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. There has been no previous reports detailing the use of locking plate for the treatment of radiation-associated fractures of the clavicle. We report a case of radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle, which was treated by locking plate fixation and autologous bone grafting.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient gave the informed consent prior being included into the study. The patient was a 67-year old man who received 70 Gy radiation therapy for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. He received 20 Gy radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and 50 Gy to the supraclavicular fossa. He had concomitant hypothyroidism. He suffered osteoradionecrosis and osteomyelitis of the mandible and received hemimandibulectomy 6 years after the radiation therapy. He was also a smoker.\n\n【6】Eight years after the radiation therapy, he suffered a pathological fracture of the right clavicle without apparent trauma. The fracture was treated conservatively at an orthopaedic clinic; however, bony union was not obtained. The displacement increased over time, and he was referred to our hospital. One year after the fracture, surgical treatment was performed due to persistent pain and weakness.\n\n【7】Radiographs demonstrated atrophic nonunion with displacement . Bone scan demonstrated hot uptake at both ends of the fractured bone . MRI demonstrated a formation of pseudoarthrosis with fluid collection and suggested bone marrow edema at both ends of the fracture fragments .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Preoperative radiograph of the fractured right clavicle demonstrating atrophic nonunion. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Preoperative bone scan demonstrating hot uptake at both ends of the fractured bone. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Preoperative MRI STIR images demonstrating a formation of pseudoarthrosis with fluid collection and suggesting bone marrow edema at both ends of the fracture fragments. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】In surgery, fibrous pseudoarthrosis tissue was excised and both ends of the fracture fragments were refreshed to identify bleeding. Open reduction and internal fixation using a 7-hole locking plate (Synthes) and autologous bone grafting were performed . Three locking screws were inserted into both fragments to fix the fracture. Cancellous bone harvested from the iliac crest was grafted to enhance bone healing.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Postoperative radiograph demonstrating fracture fixation with 7-hole locking plate supplemented with autologous bone grafting. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【13】Successful bony union was obtained by one year postoperatively . The pain disappeared and the range of motion fully recovered 6 months after the operation. The patient was satisfied with the treatment. No adverse events were observed and the reduction and fixation were maintained up to 52 months postoperatively. No further followup could be done due to the patient’s death.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | One-year postoperative radiograph demonstrating successful bony union. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Past reports suggest that fractures occur primarily with radiation doses >50 Gy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>. Our patient received 70 Gy radiation, and fracture occurred without apparent trauma; therefore, the fracture was diagnosed as a radiation-associated pathological fracture. Biopsy for pathology and culture are required for further investigation in these cases. The nonunion rate of radiation-associated fractures is reported as high at around 50%, and healing times tend to be long in fractures that eventually heal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The fracture developed atrophic nonunion radiographically. Difficulties in achieving bony union were predicted by the radiographic appearance. On the other hand, hot uptake at both ends of the fracture fragments was observed by a bone scan, and the finding suggested the existence of some biological bone activity. We hypothesized that the MRI finding of bone marrow edema suggested some biological bone activity even though the finding might be considered to show postirradiation change in the bone. However, because biological activity is considered to decrease as a result of radiation, we tried to achieve bony union by osteosynthesis with autologous bone grafting. If the bone activity was totally eliminated by radiation, vascularized bone graft should be necessary.\n\n【17】Due to the difficulty in obtaining bony union in radiation-associated fracture nonunions of the clavicle, past reports have recommended claviculectomy or resection of the pseudoarthrosis site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. These procedures have been reported to be effective for pain relief and patient comfort. Only two clinical reports have described successful open reduction and internal fixation of radiation-associated clavicle fractures. Wera et al. reported on open reduction and internal fixation of radiation-associated clavicle fractures for 3 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Two patients obtained bony union, and the remaining patient did not appear to achieve radiographic union but showed no loss of reduction at 28 months postoperatively. Fuchs et al. described the plate fixation and free vascularized corticoperiosteal bone graft for the treatment of radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle in two patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The fractures healed with good clinical results.\n\n【18】Wera et al. used autologous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest and demineralized bone matrix for the first patient, bone cement and allograft cancellous bone chips for the second patient, and demineralized bone matrix for the third patient as a void filler and enhancer of bone healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Fuchs et al. used a free vascularized corticoperiosteal bone graft from the medial femoral condyle to enhance bone healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We believe some supplementary bone healing enhancement is necessary and used autologous cancellous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest. Other tools enhancing bone healing, for example, bone morphogenetic proteins may also be useful; however, we consider that autologous bone grafting is better as it is osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive. Vascularized bone graft is also a good option; however, it is technically challenging. Our treatment result suggests that autologous cancellous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest is sufficient for bony union. If a nonvascularized bone grafting fails, a vascularized bone grafting may become salvage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Locking plate is a new technology which provides excellent angular stability and also preserves biology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Irradiated bone results in a decrease in the circulation to bone and bone quality. Therefore, we think fixation using locking plate is superior to conventional plate fixation in both the biological and mechanical aspects. Locking plate fixation is thought to be a good choice for surgical treatment of radiation-associated fracture/nonunion of the clavicle.\n\n【20】#### 4\\.

Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is a well-characterized entity that may share clinical and morphological findings with other low-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Dissemination of MALT-type lymphoma to bone marrow and peripheral blood simultaneously with the presence of T-large granular cell leukemia (T-LGL) has rarely been reported. Case Presentation. This is the case of a 42-year-old male who presented with a gastric MALT-type lymphoma, disseminated to the bone marrow and the peripheral blood with high serum IgM levels and t(11;18)(q21;q21). The morphological, immunophenotypical and, immunohistochemical studies of the successive bone marrow and peripheral blood samples had revealed the coexistence of two distinct lymphoma cell populations: a B-cell, marginal zone type population expressing CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79b, IgM, and kappa light chain, and a T-large granular cell population, developed after treatment with rituximab expressing CD3, CD8, CD5, CD7, and CD45. Conclusion. Based on the analysis of this unusual case we performed an extensive review of the literature to elucidate the relationship between T-LGL and B-cell lymphomas and to emphasize the importance of paraprotein analysis at diagnosis of gastric MALT lymphoma.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are extranodal B-cell marginal zone lymphomas that generally follow an indolent course. Fifty percent of all MALT lymphomas arise from the stomach and are commonly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. Nongastric MALT lymphomas occur in the lung, salivary gland, skin, and other organs often associated with autoimmune disease. Bone marrow involvement has been reported in 23.5% to 37% of cases at presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Leukemic dissemination has only sporadically been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Disseminated MALT lymphoma may mimic Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia by causing Waldenstrom syndrome. Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) was detected in 17.2% of cases with B-cell NHL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and 36% of cases with MALT-type lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. IgG was more frequent in cases with aggressive NHL, while IgM was more common in cases with low-grade NHL. It was usually associated with advanced disease, typically showing bone marrow and peripheral blood involvement  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. However, Wöhrer et al. found that MG although a common phenomenon in MALT lymphoma was not correlated with clinical stage, genetic findings, H. pylori status, or response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Reported cases of gastric MALT lymphoma with monoclonal gammopathy.</u>\n\n【6】CD5 expression is rare in MALT lymphoma and is often associated with nongastric disease and an increased tendency to present with disseminated disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The detection of t(11;18)(q21;q21) is useful in disseminated cases. This translocation was predominantly found in gastric MALT lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, associated with the resistance to H. pylori eradication therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u> and associated with the development of H. pylori\\-independent gastric MALT lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Concomitant or sequential occurrence of MALT lymphoma and other primary B-cell neoplasms has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u>. Coexistence of B-cell and T-cell lymphomatous populations in the same patient has rarely been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54, 55\\]</u>. However, association of T-cell leukemia and MALT lymphoma had not yet been described.\n\n【9】We describe in the present report a case of disseminated gastric MALT lymphoma, with t(11;18)(q21;q21), MG, resistance to H. pylori eradication, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and subsequent appearance of a predominant T-cell large granular leukemia.\n\n【10】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【11】A 42-year-old male/bricklayer was admitted in 2006 for high grade fever and dyspnea. He had a 2-month history of epigastric pain, peptic discomfort, and dizziness. Physical examination showed left pleural effusion, ascites, dehydration, and cachectic appearance. Laboratory tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 21.3 Giga/L with 80% neutrophils and 12% atypical lymphocytes, a total serum protein level of 101 g/L with hypoalbuminemia at 30 g/L (N: 40–47 g/L), an IgM level of 52 g/L (0.5–2.4 g/L), a kappa light chains level of 9.07 g/L (N: 2–4.4 g/L), a kappa/lambda ratio of 7.96 (N: 1.35–2.65), and a C reactive protein (CRP) of 365 mg/L (N: <5 mg/L); the Bence-Jones protein in urine was negative; the renal and liver function tests, LDH, and β2-microglobulin titers were normal. The serologic tests for EBV, CMV, and chronic viral hepatitis including HCV were unremarkable. The total body CT scan showed a left pleural effusion with lower lobe atelectasis, circumferential thickening of the gastric wall predominantly affecting the greater curvature. There was no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or brain lesion. A total skeletal survey showed no bone lesion. The bronchial endoscopy showed no tumor. Gastric endoscopy confirmed the presence of a huge tumor with surface ulceration at the greater curvature. Histological examination of biopsies revealed a typical lymphoepithelial lesion compatible with low-grade MALT-type lymphoma and positive Helicobacter pylori chronic gastritis. The immunostaining showed positive CD20, CD5, CD38, and κ\\-light chain stains but negative CD10, cyclin D1, and λ\\-light chain stains. The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed colonization with plasmacytoid cells and dense infiltrations by small lymphocytes extending to the paratrabecular zone. The karyotype study of the bone marrow aspirate revealed a typical, specific translocation of gastric MALT lymphoma, t(11;18)(q21;q21) in 30 out of 38 metaphases .\n\n【12】The cytological examination of the pleural and peritoneal fluids was negative. The histological examination of the pleural biopsy showed a nonspecific subacute suppurative pleuritis with no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【13】After adequate hydration and antibiotic therapy, the respiratory function and the white blood cell count returned to normal but with an atypical plasmacytoid lymphocytosis reaching 35%. The patient received 6 courses of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and rituximab and then 3 courses of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The gastric lesion and the monoclonal paraproteinemia remained, however, unchanged. The cytological examination of the bone marrow aspirate revealed the presence of a predominant mature granular lymphocytosis associated with an atypical plasmacytoid lymphocytosis. The flow cytometry analysis of this aspirate identified two cell populations, one population of T-cells expressing mainly the CD8+/CD3+/CD5+/CD7+/CD45+ immunophenotype representing 40% of the examined cells  and a second population representing 20% of these cells and consisting of monoclonal B-cells expressing kappa light chain, IgM, CD19, CD79b, CD20, and CD22.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 A T-lymphocyte showing an abundant granular cytoplasm and selected gated dual parameter dot plots of T-cells displaying CD3, CD8, CD7, CD45, and CD5.</u>\n\n【15】The patient was ultimately put on an expectant management option “watchful waiting.” The serum electrophoresis peak remained the same ; the gastric lesion remained unchanged during four years. The patient died from an evolving pulmonary infection in 2013.\n\n【16】Molecular study of T-cell receptor genes was attempted in postmortem using the paraffin-embedded bone marrow specimen that has failed to assess clonality because of the degraded DNA.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】The leukemic presentation, the refractoriness to chemoimmunotherapy, the IgM kappa production, and the presence of t(11;18)(q21;q21) characterize the clinical picture of our patient with gastric MALT lymphoma. Therefore, the marginal zone B-cell population invading the bone marrow and the peripheral blood has decreased, after treatment with rituximab, and a second malignant T-cell population emerged and became predominant.\n\n【19】The tumor cells at the initial presentation had plasmacytic differentiation . The plasmacytic morphology may be found in 30% of extragastric MALT-type lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and only 10% of gastric MALT lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56, 57\\]</u>. It is a rare finding in lymphomas with t(11;18)(q21;q21) which are mostly associated with monocytoid morphology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 A B-lymphocyte showing a plasmacytic differentiation and selected gated dual parameter dot plots displaying CD19, IgM, CD25, and CD79a.</u>\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 The karyotype of the malignant bone marrow cells at presentation that shows the t(11;18)(q21;q21).</u>\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 The serum protein electrophoresis graph that remained unchanged during the course of the disease.</u>\n\n【23】Leukemic dissemination has only sporadically been described in MALT lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. It has been significantly related to bone marrow infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>. However, the presence of a serum monoclonal component has not been associated with the disseminated disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) is the most structural chromosomal abnormality found in MALT-type lymphoma occurring in about one-third of the cases, involving different sites mainly gastric ones, at any stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>. It has been shown that this translocation is a marker of resistance to H. pylori eradication and may indicate that it confers an independent growth advantage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>. The trisomy of chromosome 3 represents the most frequent numerical abnormality in MALT lymphoma; however, it is not specific for this lymphoma subtype and has no prognostic significance although it has been associated with a plasmacytoid appearance of the leukemic lymphocytes and IgM hypergammaglobulinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>. Although t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-BCL2 is the genetic hallmark of follicular lymphoma, this reciprocal translocation, closely related to t(11;18), has been described in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, mostly nongastric MALT lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>. BCL10 nuclear expression is also closely related to the presence of the t(11;18) and found in disseminated gastric MALT lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Gastric MALT lymphoma with t(11;18) and extragastric MALT lymphoma with trisomy 18 are groups with the higher risk of dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>.\n\n【26】CD5 expression is typically absent in MALT-type lymphoma; however, it is sometimes aberrantly coexpressed in nongastric, even localized disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u> and associated with increased tendency to relapse, refractoriness to therapy, and dissemination to bone marrow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 63\\]</u>. It has also been associated with monoclonal paraprotein production in some cases .\n\n【27】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Reported cases of nongastric MALT lymphoma with monoclonal gammopathy.</u>\n\n【28】Positive expression of BCL2 has been associated with unfavorable survival in extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and MALT lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[64\\]</u>.\n\n【29】The frequency of H. pylori infection is higher in MALT lymphoma restricted to the stomach. Although the eradication of H. pylori may result in clinical and histological remission in 90% of patients, molecular evidence of persistent gastric MALT lymphoma may be found in 40% of these cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65\\]</u>.\n\n【30】The curative potential of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is questionable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[66\\]</u>. Plasmacytic differentiation and monoclonal gammopathy do not influence the rate of disease progression. Rituximab has only moderate activity in terms of inducing objective responses in disseminated MALT lymphoma. However, long-term disease stabilization along with a symptomatic benefit has been seen in some patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>. Moreover rituximab could select latent clonal CD20− populations in some patients.\n\n【31】The morphology and the immunophenotype CD3+/CD5+/CD7+/CD45+/CD10− of the second malignant population in the bone marrow of the presented patient are consistent with the sequential occurrence of a T-large granular cell leukemia. The association of clonal T-LGL proliferations with clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, although rare, is now well recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54, 67\\]</u>. T-LGL is a chronic and often indolent T-cell proliferation. The transformation of an indolent lymphoma to a more aggressive one of the same immunological origin is a well-recognized event. In a population-based series of unselected patients with multiple histology lymphomas, Tucci et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u> reported that the most frequent transformation from marginal zone lymphoma was to DLBCL. Reciprocally a sequential appearance of marginal zone lymphoma after treatment for DLBCL has also been observed which may have been unrecognized in the first diagnostic biopsy. Coexistence of B-cell and T-cell lymphoma populations in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of the same patient has rarely been reported. Synchronous clonal T-LGL has been reported in patients with splenic marginal zone lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54, 55\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Reported cases of gastric and nongastric MALT-type lymphoma with monoclonal gammopathy are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Thymic MALT lymphoma seems to be clinicopathologically a distinctive form with prevalence in Asians, strong association with autoimmune disease, marked female predominance, frequent presence of epithelium-lined cysts, almost invariable presence of a neoplastic plasma cell component, expression of IgA phenotype, and absence of API2-MALT1 gene fusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[68, 69\\]</u>. Cases of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) have been reported in patients with MALT lymphoma. Most of these patients had tumors with plasmacytic differentiation and two of them presented with monoclonal gammopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[70\\]</u>.\n\n【33】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【34】Leukemic dissemination and monoclonal macroglobulinemia have only sporadically been described in MALT-type lymphoma. Furthermore, subsequent development of T-cell LGL with simultaneous presence of two different lymphoma populations in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow remains an unusual event. Thus, pending additional data, we recommend including the paraprotein analysis and the flow cytometric studies in the pretherapeutic workup of patients with MALT lymphoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:12:31", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:12:44", "cost": 13.626}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:12:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:12:31"}

Case Report\n\n【6】In June 2012, a 9-year-old Japanese girl was referred to private clinic by a general dentist for detailed examination of a gingival abscess in the mandibular right second premolar. The medical history of the patient was unremarkable, and there was no relevant family history of medical or dental abnormalities.

The pulp vitality test was negative. The clinical diagnosis was acute periradicular periodontitis of the mandibular right second premolar with pulpal necrosis.\n\n【9】The patient underwent oral surgery at Kyushu Dental University Hospital. The reason for hospitalization was because she was not able to eat for gingival swelling and spontaneous pain. During hospitalization, she received an intravenous drip containing an antibiotic. She left the hospital 6 days later and was referred to our clinic. Postsurgery intraoral examination showed no abnormalities on the gingiva of the mandibular right second premolar . However, the talon cusp of the mandibular right second premolar was fractured . Without using anesthetic, the tooth was isolated with a rubber dam and accessed. Upon entering the coronal aspect of the root canal, hemorrhaging into the pulp chamber was observed . A file of 10 K size was inserted into the canal. The length of file is 10 mm. And the patient reported discomfort, indicating potential survival of residual vital pulp tissue. The hemorrhaging in the coronal portion of the canal was gently irrigated; then the area was debrided using 1.5 mL of 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 1.5 mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 10\\]</u>. No instrumentation was performed. Next, MTA (Pro-Root MTA, Dentsply Sankin, Tochigi, Japan) was packed into the canal using MAP system (Dentsply Sankin, Tochigi, Japan)  and the access cavity was closed with glass-ionomer cement (Fuji IX GP, GC, Tokyo, Japan).

Discussion\n\n【16】Apexogenesis is done is in immature teeth when part of the pulp tissue inside the root canal remains vital and apparently healthy. This procedure allows continued physiological development and formation of the root end.\n\n【17】In cases with an immature root with a large apical foramen, pulp infection associated with an apical lesion does not always indicate pulp necrosis, as seen in our patient, likely because the pulp at this stage is vital enough and has extremely high healing ability. Those procedures have been shown to result in increased thickening of the canal walls by deposition of hard tissue and encourage continued root development in affected immature permanent teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–13\\]</u>. Continued root development of revascularization of immature permanent necrotic teeth depends on whether Hertwig’s epithelial sheath survives in cases of apical periodontitis/abscess.　Hertwig’s epithelial sheath has important role in root development and shape and may be involved in regulation of the differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells with the formation of cementum.\n\n【18】MTA is a cement material with excellent biocompatibility and good sealing capacity that is able to produce hard tissues such as dentin and cementum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. It is used for apexification and sealing of communication between the root and periodontal tissue, such as in reverse root canal filling and perforation repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, there are few reports of its use for pulp revascularization using MTA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 16\\]</u>. Calcium hydroxide formulations are typically used for apexogenesis and poor sealing capacity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Furthermore, formation of a necrotic layer immediately beneath the pulp can occur and the procedure must be changed to a pulpectomy in some cases due to spreading inflammation, as it does not provide an adequate biodefense mechanism against even a limited bacterial invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Accordingly, we used MTA in this case. Generally, the root of a tooth with pulp revascularization is smaller than a mature tooth and is characterized by more rapid calcification of the pulp than that seen after a conventional apexogenesis procedure, as noted in the present case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Chen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> demonstrated five types of response of these immature teeth with infected necrotic pulp tissue and apical periodontitis/abscess to revascularization procedures: type 5, formation of a hard tissue barrier in the canal between the coronal cement plug and root apex using MTA. The present case was consistent with type 5. In cases with an immature root with a large apical foramen, pulp infection associated with an apical lesion does not always indicate pulp necrosis, as seen in our patient, likely because the pulp at this stage is vital enough and has extremely high healing ability. It has been reported that pulp revascularization was induced by removing infective material from the root canal and applying calcium hydroxide past MTA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 12\\]</u>. Traditionally, in the clinical protocol for revascularization treatment, several kinds of antibacterial medicine were used. But, recently, it reported that a single-visit pulp revascularization protocol can be a favorable treatment for partially necrotic immature permanent teeth using MTA as a pulpal seal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Accordingly, for immature tooth with a pulp infection and open apical foramen, treatment should start with pulp revascularization and then shift to apexification if incurable, while considering the infection to be reversible.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】In the present case, clinical and radiographic evidence showed successful use of MTA for revascularization treatment of an immature permanent tooth. More studies are necessary to understand the mechanisms of pulp revascularization comparing different protocols.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:35:22", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:35:42", "cost": 20.316}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:35:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:35:22"}

During the first-trimester ultrasonography of the unborn patient, an increased thickness of the nuchal fold was detected. The mother reported decreased foetal movements during the pregnancy. After the boy was born, his general condition was extremely severe. The clinical signs indicated a suspected neuromuscular disorder. A precise diagnosis, type 0 SMA, was determined 7 days after birth through a newborn pilot-screening for SMA, which was conducted for all newborns whose parents consented to participate. The condition of the infant deteriorated. He had severe respiratory distress followed by multiple events leading to his death. Currently, there are only a few published case reports detailing an increased nuchal translucency (NT) measurement in association with a diagnosis of SMA in the foetus. However, an increased NT measurement is a clinically relevant sign as it can be related to genetic syndromes, foetal malformations, disruptions, and dysplasias. Since there is no cure for infants with type 0 SMA at present, it is crucial to be able to detect this disease prenatally in order to provide the best possible care for the patient and parents. This includes the provision of palliative care for the patient, among other measures. This case report highlights the prenatal signs and symptoms in relation to type 0 SMA.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Spinal muscular atrophy 5q (SMA5q) is a genetic disease characterised by the degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common cause is the deletion of exon 7 in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. The severity of the disease correlates with the number of copies of the survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The SMN protein is synthesized by two genes: SMN1 and SMN2. In each cell, there are typically two copies of the SMN1 gene and one or two copies of the SMN2 gene. The number of SMN2 gene copies can vary, with some individuals having up to eight copies. Although the SMN2 and SMN1 genes produce proteins that are identical, only a small fraction of functional protein, about 10 to 15 percent, is synthesized by the SMN2 gene, with the majority being produced by the SMN1 gene. Therefore, the number of SMN2 gene copies a person has can significantly impact the amount of SMN protein they can generate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】According to available data, the incidence of the disease in Latvia is 1/9,091 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As of 2021, the population of Latvia was approximately 1.89 million people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, with 17,420 live births recorded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Newborn screening has been implemented in Latvia since April 2023 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, following a pilot study that offered the opportunity to participate in an expanded screening program starting on December 1, 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The global incidence of spinal muscular atrophy is about 1 in 10,000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The carrier frequency worldwide is around 1 in 35 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Patients in Latvia that are diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy have two treatment options: risdiplam and nusinersen. Nusinersen received European approval in June 2017 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> and became accessible in Latvia by July 2019. More recently, risdiplam received European approval in February 2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and became accessible in Latvia by February 2022.\n\n【5】The disease is classified into five types depending on the age of onset and the clinical course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The most severe type is SMA type 0, and the least severe is SMA type 4 . SMA type 0 manifests prenatally. Mothers of affected children can experience a decrease or even a loss of foetal movements during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In addition, foetuses may present with intrauterine growth retardation, pulmonary hypoplasia, and skeletal abnormalities. Newborns with SMA type 0 have a severe muscle weakness and hypotonia at birth. They often present with areflexia, congenital heart defects, and facial diplegia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.

Case Presentation\n\n【8】This case report presents the first registered patient in Latvia with type 0 SMA. The index case was a male infant from nonconsanguineous parents. The mother was a 33-year-old Caucasian female. She did not smoke and had no health issues. The father was a 35-year-old Caucasian male with no chronic illnesses. There was no positive family history of SMA; however, both parents were carriers of a mutated SMN1 gene. The index patient was their second baby. The previous pregnancy was uneventful, and a healthy child was born. Thus far, no SMA5q symptoms have been reported.\n\n【9】The mother’s pregnancy with the proband was considered high risk due to her age. Consequently, several ultrasonographic parameters (thickness of foetal nuchal translucency (NT), nasal bone length, tricuspid valve and ductus venosus dopplerometry, and foetal heart rate) were assessed, as were maternal serum biochemical parameters. Chorionic villus sampling was performed as a precautionary measure due to the increased risk of aneuploidy, changes observed in ultrasound readings, and maternal age.\n\n【10】During the first-trimester ultrasonography, an increased thickness of the nuchal fold (7.9 mm; <2.5 mm or <95<sup>th</sup> percentile, places the pregnancy at a low risk; ≥6.5 mm, places the pregnancy at a high risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>) was detected as well as a cystic hygroma. No heart defects were detected. Chorionic villus sampling excluded common chromosomal aneuploidies by quantitative fluorescent PCR. Furthermore, chromosomal microarray analysis did not show any pathological variations. The mother reported reduced foetal movements throughout the pregnancy, especially during the third trimester. Despite a normal chromosomal microarray analysis result, a high index of suspicion for genetic pathology was maintained in view of abnormal ultrasonographic findings. However, extensive panel genetic testing using next-generation sequencing or exome sequencing was not performed as it is not a routine prenatal test in Latvia.\n\n【11】The patient was born at 36<sup>+1</sup> weeks of gestational age. Due to pelvic presentation, followed by an external cephalic version and bradycardia, an acute caesarean section was performed. The weight of the neonate was 2,950 grams (17<sup>th</sup> percentile) and the length was 50 cm (52<sup>nd</sup> percentile). The head circumference was 35 cm (66<sup>th</sup> percentile).\n\n【12】After the birth, the general condition of the infant was extremely severe. The patient had severe asphyxia during labour. Primary resuscitation was initiated, comprising tactile stimulation, upper airway suctioning, and ventilation. The patient had severe respiratory distress, no active movements, atonia, and areflexia, and his skin was cyanotic. The Apgar scores were 1/1/2/3. To provide ventilatory support, intubation was required in the first minute after birth; however, the patient’s condition deteriorated, and so mechanical ventilation was implemented. The patient experienced a femur fracture and newborn hypoglycemia and was later diagnosed with an atrial septal defect.\n\n【13】To identify the cause of the infant’s severe condition, TORCH infections were checked for and excluded, a head MRI was performed, and a geneticist was consulted. The head MRI results reported multiple ischaemic foci in the frontal and parietal lobes and in the basal ganglia. Based on the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms, the geneticist suspected SMA. The parents consented to newborn screening for SMA5q and 7 days after birth, a homozygous deletion of exon 7 in the SMN1 gene was reported. Further genetic analysis as part of the Latvian newborn screening protocol detected 0 copies of the SMN1 gene and 1 copy of the SMN2 gene. A diagnosis of type 0 SMA was confirmed.\n\n【14】Ten days after their son’s birth, a multidisciplinary team informed the parents about his type 0 SMA diagnosis. They were informed about the limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Following a full discussion, the parents decided against invasive mechanical ventilation, and the infant was extubated. Rapid desaturation, bradycardia, and cardiac arrest followed and the patient died.\n\n【15】The concluding diagnoses of the neonate were as follows: type 0 SMA, severe asphyxia during labour, femur fracture, atrial septal defect, and newborn hypoglycemia.\n\n【16】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【17】We report here the case of a newborn with type 0 SMA. At the first-trimester ultrasonography, an increased NT thickness was detected. After birth, the patient had severe respiratory distress followed by multiple events leading to a fatal outcome.\n\n【18】Currently, the identification of SMA-affected infants prior to the presentation of clinical symptoms is accomplished by newborn screening. However, the severity of this disorder highlights the importance of prenatal detection.\n\n【19】NT thickness evaluation is associated with multiple foetal malformations, genetic syndromes, intrauterine death risk, congenital heart defects, and a high risk of miscarriage. Most of the structural anomalies are undetectable prior to childbirth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. There are only a few published case reports of an increased NT measurement in association with a diagnosis of SMA type 0 in the foetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The study by Parra et al. explored the correlation between increased NT in SMA foetuses and the severity of the disease. The findings suggested that a thickened NT is an infrequent occurrence in most foetuses that are affected by SMA, but it may indicate the relevance of SMN2 copy number in the development of congenital heart defects and elevated NT values. The research highlighted the significance of early echocardiography to monitor at-risk foetuses and detect potential complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. In some cases, it may present with multiple health issues, as evidenced by our case involving a newborn diagnosed with SMA type 0. The index case also had severe asphyxia during labour, femur fracture, atrial septal defect, and newborn hypoglycemia, illustrating the complexity and severity of type 0 SMA and its associated complications.\n\n【21】It is well established that an increased NT thickness is predictive value for an adverse pregnancy outcome, even if conventional karyotyping is normal. The risk of foetal malformations is proportional to the NT thickness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Specifically, if the enlargement is between 3.5 and 4.4 mm, the risk of a foetal chromosome abnormality is 21%, rising to 33% if it is 5 mm, 50% if it is 6 mm, and 65% if it is greater than 6.5 mm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. However, multiple studies have shown no association between an increased NT thickness and the diagnosis of SMA, suggesting that SMA-affected foetuses have normal NT thickness values. For instance, a study by Zadeh et al. investigated 12 SMA-affected infants with confirmed NT thickness results during pregnancy. All the foetuses had normal NT thickness values ranging from 0.7 to 2.4 mm, implying the SMA is not associated with an enlarged NT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Barone and Bianca examining 29 women proposed that foetal genetic testing of the SMN1 gene on the basis of increased NT thickness is not indicated in couples with no previous history of SMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the findings of Parra et al. support the idea that SMN2 gene copy number in SMA foetuses is relevant for the development of congenital heart defects and increased NT thickness values 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【22】A broad range of options is needed to help diagnose SMA prenatally. The gold standard for SMA diagnosis is multiplex ligation probe analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>, a targeted test. However, as an increased NT thickness is not currently considered a sign of SMA, this would not have been employed in the case described here. If the signs are not clear, then prenatally the best next-generation sequencing method is exome sequencing; however, it requires specific bioinformatic analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>, as SMN1 and SMN2 are genes with high homology. If a neuromuscular disorder is suspected, then targeted neuromuscular disease panels can be used, as described by Zhao et al. and Tan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28, 29\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The mother’s observation of decreased foetal movements served as an additional indication of potential pathology for the unborn child. Nonetheless, research suggests that only in rare cases are reduced foetal movements associated with foetal neuromuscular disorders. In our case, the reduced movements suggested that the symptoms of a neuromuscular disorder were already present before birth. Studies show that in cases of SMA type 0, reduced foetal movements are typically experienced between 30 and 36 weeks of gestation and are associated with a markedly restricted lifespan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The findings reported by Grotto et al. regarding the clinical manifestations of SMA type 0 are consistent with those observed in the patient presented in our report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The importance of early diagnosis and management of the disease is enhanced. As noted by Andrea et al. the lack of a specific and proven treatment for SMA type 0 underscores the need for further research in this area. Well-designed studies are necessary to assess potential treatments. In the meantime, healthcare providers should focus on providing appropriate palliative care and genetic counseling to affected families. Early diagnosis, preferably even before birth, can aid in the provision of optimal care to patients with SMA type 0 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The reported cases of type 0 SMA have been ventilator dependent and have ultimately passed away in the neonatal period after ventilation support was withdrawn, usually at the request of parents. Our case was no different. The infant was ventilator-dependent and passed away after ventilation support was withdrawn at the request of the parents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 31, 32\\]</u>.\n\n【26】In rare cases, type 0 SMA can be accompanied by additional features, known as SMA plus. A case report by Gathwala et. al shed light on a case of SMA type 0 in combination with a Dandy–Walker variant, which was confirmed through molecular genetic analysis that revealed the homozygous deletion of exon 7 of the SMN1 gene. After the patient was born, a CT scan was conducted. It showed partial vermian hypoplasia and partial obstruction in the fourth ventricle. There was no enlargement observed in the posterior fossa. These results were consistent with a diagnosis of a Dandy–Walker variant. While SMA plus is not uncommon and various additional features have been described, the combination of SMA type 0 with the Dandy–Walker variant is particularly rare. These case studies highlight the need for increased awareness and understanding of the complex nature of SMA and its associated conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\n【27】In the case described here, more comprehensive diagnostic procedures should have been performed to try and identify the cause of the abnormal NT result prenatally. This information would have given the parents the option of terminating the pregnancy. In addition, carrying out a more thorough evaluation to determine the cause of decreased foetal movements, along with the abnormal NT result, would have led to improved patient care and enhanced support for the parents. Such care could have included palliative care for the baby and enhanced psychological support for the parents. However, a major consideration in this case was the financial support provided by the parents’ health insurance, which did not allow for extensive diagnostic procedures.\n\n【28】Innovative treatments have been developed for patients with SMA. However, the treatment options for type 0 SMA patients are limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. These patients require respiratory and feeding support, which typically is not enough to keep the patients alive. A recent case report from Matesanz et al. described the clinical course of a patient with type 0 SMA who was treated with nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. Although the infant had modest motor improvements, she also had continued systemic complications from her SMA, thus highlighting the challenges of treating patients with more severe phenotypes of SMA. Nevertheless, the possibility that the genetic treatment had a positive effect compared to the original course of the disease cannot be denied. Similar to our case, this patient had multiple medical conditions that were related to their underlying issue, including cardiac abnormalities such as atrial and ventricular septal defects. Studies propose that individuals with a lower copy number of SMN2 and a more severe phenotype of spinal muscular atrophy are more likely to have structural heart malformations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Tiberi et al.‘s case report presented the case of a type 0 SMA patient with 1 copy of the SMN2 gene. At the age of 13 days, the infant received treatment with nusinersen. Although he showed mild motor improvement, he required a tracheostomy at the age of 4 months. An increasing cardiac and autonomic dysfunction followed, and he died at the age of 5 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Therefore, the available data suggest that despite the development of innovative treatments for SMA, they are unlikely to produce a significant positive effect in type 0 patients.\n\n【30】According to a study, the reported incidence of SMA in Latvia is 1 in 9,091 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The first results of a pilot-screening involved an examination of 10,411 patients, resulting in the identification of SMA 5q-positive cases at a frequency of 1 in 5,205 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. However, the duration of the screening period was insufficient to firmly establish this incidence rate. Between December 2021 and April 2023, a pilot screening for SMA was conducted on 26,421 newborns in Latvia. It gave a valuable insight on this condition. Previously unpublished data revealed 3 confirmed cases of SMA, suggesting a slightly higher incidence rate than previously reported. The new findings suggest that the occurrence of SMA in Latvia is approximately 1 out of every 8,807 individuals. As a proactive measure, starting in April 2023, SMA has been integrated into the newborn screening program in Latvia. This holds promising implications and enhances the likelihood of early detection and administration of presymptomatic treatment for newborns affected by spinal muscular atrophy.\n\n【31】Despite the fact that the outcome expectancy of patients with type 0 SMA is pessimistic and the disease leads to early mortality, newborn screening for SMA5q can significantly improve the life expectancy and quality of patients with other types of SMA. There is evidence that presymptomatic treatment initiated as a result of newborn screening improves the outcome of children with genetically proven SMA. Including newborn screening for SMA is vital in order to initiate treatment presymptomatically and obtain the best outcome for patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. In our case, the parents’ other child has not been tested for SMA yet. The child displays no observable indications of a neuromuscular disorder and has not undergone evaluation by a geneticist. However, it would be prudent for the child to seek consultation with a geneticist and a neurologist if any symptoms appear.\n\n【32】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【33】Since there are no treatment options for infants with type 0 SMA at present, it is vital to be able to detect this disease prenatally in order to provide the best possible care for the patient and parents including the provision of palliative care for the patient, if needed. An increased NT is a clinically relevant sign that can be related to multiple foetal malformations, genetic syndromes, intrauterine death risk, congenital heart defects, and high risk of miscarriage. However, at present, there are only limited data supporting an association between NT enlargement and SMA.\n\n【34】Employment of extensive panel genetic testing using next-generation sequencing would be beneficial for the prenatal diagnosis of type 0 SMA cases. Moreover, sequencing of foetal exomes covering single nucleotide variations and copy number variations (also SMN1) offers a broader diagnostic capacity for pregnancies with unexpected foetal anomalies, thus improving both diagnostic timing and counseling for parents. Early recognition of the disease would give parents time to come to terms with the situation as well as provide the option of pregnancy termination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:35:46", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:36:03", "cost": 17.266}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:36:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:35:46"}

Here we present a case of gastric ECC coexistent with adenocarcinoma as well as p53 gene analyses of ECC and adenocarcinoma.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 69-year-old female presented to our institution with epigastralgia and abdominal distension. Her past medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia. On physical examination, her cognitive consciousness was alert. Her height, weight, and body mass index were 144.2 cm, 53.3 kg, and 25.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Mild anemia was evident in her palpebral conjunctiva. Chest auscultation revealed no abnormal findings. The abdomen was soft and flat with normal bowel sounds. No lymph nodes were palpable, and no tumors were palpable on rectal examination. Blood chemistry analyses  revealed mild anemia (red blood cell count, /μL; hemoglobin levels, 9.9 mg/dL), mildly increased C-reactive protein levels (0.6 mg/dL), mildly increased brain natriuretic peptide levels (55.6 pg/mL), and evidence of coagulation dysfunction (prothrombin time, 79%; international normalized ratio, 1.19). The tumor markers serum carcinoembryonic antigen (0.8 ng/mL) and serum carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (3.4 U/mL) were within normal limits. Chest radiography revealed cardiothoracic ratio of 51.4% without any evidence of pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion. Abdominal radiography revealed no abnormal gas distribution. Upper gastrointestinal series  revealed a 5 cm ulcerative lesion with irregular margins and elevated distinct borders from the angle to the pyloric ring. Gastroendoscopy  revealed a Borrmann type 2 tumor, extending from the angle to the antrum of the lesser curvature. The tumor comprised two different parts: ulcers with severe invasiveness and smooth protrusion from the endocrine cells  and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma cells  as exhibited by specimens biopsied under gastroendoscopy. ECC was confirmed by immunostaining examinations of cells, exhibiting positive results of chromogranin, synaptophysin, cytokeratin (CK) 7, and EMA . Other specimens revealed atypical cells forming glandular structures, leading to the diagnosis of well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (tub1) . Preoperative enhanced whole-body computed tomography (CT) revealed no distant metastases, signs of peritoneal dissemination, and regional lymph nodes swelling. Therefore, our gastric tumor was diagnosed as stage IIA tumor preoperatively. Subsequently, distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and Billroth I reconstruction was performed. Pathological examination of the gross specimen  revealed that adenocarcinoma cells comprised <10% of all cancer cells. Close analysis of ECC revealed a mixture of small and large cells, and 58% of Ki-67 labeling index . According to the WHO 2010 classification of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), ECC that coexists with adenocarcinoma (>30%) should be classified as “mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma”. However, adenocarcinoma comprised <10% of all cancer cells; therefore, this gastric tumor was classified as NEC.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory data on admission.</u>\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Upper gastrointestinal series revealed a 5 cm ulcerative lesion with irregular margins and elevated distinct borders from the angle to the pyloric ring (a).

One year following surgery, follow-up abdominal CT revealed multiple liver metastases. The patient received the best supportive care but eventually died 18 months after surgery.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】ECC composes highly atypical neoplastic endocrine cells and is a poor highly malignant cancer with rapid progression, early vessel invasion, early metastasis, and poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. ECC is opposite of carcinoid, which is low atypical and low malignant. The clinical presentation of ECC is similar to that of adenocarcinoma except that it has a more biologically aggressive character. The mean survival time of ECC is 7 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Morphologically, most ECCs develop into Borrmann type 2 tumors; however, few predominantly develop into submucosal layers similar to carcinoid tumors and form ulcerated lesions along with severe invasion into submucosal layers, thereby exhibiting Borrmann type 3 tumors. ECC is usually treated using a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Because the response rate of chemotherapy widely varies, no established regimen exists to date. ECC is treated using the treatment regimen for small cell lung carcinoma with cisplatin and etoposide, irinotecan, or paclitaxel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The gastric cancer regimen, S-1 with cisplatin, is also reportedly effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【16】ECC comprises either small or large or both types of cells. In addition, the prevalence of coexistence of ECC with adenocarcinoma can be as high as 72.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. ECC is considered to develop as follows: differentiated glandular cancer cells arise initially, followed by the emergence of neoplastic endocrine cells (with high proliferative ability) through the differentiation of glandular cancer cells, and subsequently, endocrine cancer cells rapidly proliferate from the deep gland to submucosal layers, thereby forming glandular endocrine cancer.\n\n【17】Gastric ECC usually arises under submucosal layers, coexisting with mucosal adenocarcinoma. Normal mucosa covers over ECC; therefore, ECC is usually diagnosed as differentiated adenocarcinoma by specimens biopsied under endoscopy. With regard to the growth of ECC, the following four types of pathways have been hypothesized: (i) ECCs arise from pre-existing adenocarcinomas; (ii) ECCs arise from pre-existing carcinoid tumors: (iii) ECCs arise from nonneoplastic multipotent stem cells; (iv) ECCs arise from nonneoplastic endocrine cells. Of these, most gastrointestinal ECCs are considered to follow the first pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【19】When biopsied specimens reveal proliferation of small nuclear cancer cells without glandular structure, immunostaining should be performed to confirm ECC. Moreover, ECC occasionally comprised various types of cancer cells; therefore, endoscopic morphology of gastric ECC may vary according to the proportion of endocrine cancer cells. In the present case, during adjuvant chemotherapy following R0 resection, multiple liver metastases developed. Thus, future studies must focus on the emergence of promising anticancer agents or chemotherapy protocols.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:27:31", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:28:34", "cost": 62.898}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:37", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:28:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:27:31"}

Radiographic evidence of a synostosis of the proximal TFJ was demonstrated in 3 knees (3 patients). The synostosis appeared incidental and was not the cause of symptoms in any of them. These patients were further examined with MRI and/or CT scans. In two cases, which were found to be primary (idiopathic), the synostosis was complete and bony. In a third case the lesion was secondary (acquired) to surgical reconstruction for a depressed fracture of the lateral tibial plateau. This iatrogenic complication followed open reduction, internal fixation, and grafting with synthetic bone. The bridging of the joint on the CT views was partial and compatible with ectopic calcification rather than ossification. The patients were treated conservatively and were followed for an average period of 3 years. No evidence that the synostosis accelerated the onset or progression of the degenerative changes to the ipsilateral knee could be verified.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Synostosis of the proximal tibiofibular joint (TFJ) is extremely rare. It may occur in skeletally immature patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>, adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, or adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–9\\]</u>. It may be caused by the coalescence of “kissing” osteochondromata in patients with multiple hereditary exostoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 10\\]</u>, or may be associated with other generalized syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and knee valgus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Synostosis with no associated syndromes or deformities has been previously reported in only 3 patients. In two adults the synostosis was primary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>, while in a 14-year-old girl the iatrogenic lesion was secondary to tibial nailing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our data referring to 3 patients with a unilateral synostosis of the proximal TFJ, identified among 1029 patients examined for degenerative knee arthritis, are presented and discussed.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】A total of 1029 patients, with an age range from 46 to 96 years (mean 71.34 years), were examined clinically and radiologically, in a 4-year period (from 2005 to 2008), for degenerative knee arthritis. There were 817 women with an age range from 46 to 94 years (mean 70.66 years) and 212 men with an age range from 46 to 96 years (mean 74.28 years).\n\n【6】Synostosis of the proximal TFJ was diagnosed in 3 patients (3 knees). None of them was overweight and none of them complained of pain at rest or during the night. They all reported to have “normal” physical activities of daily living and no functional limitations. No symptoms could be detected around the proximal TFJ in any of our patients nor was there any demonstrable peroneal neuropathy. There was no observed difference in the patients with synostosis and the whole group of patients with degenerative arthritis in terms of pain, range of motion, activity level, and weather influences. According to the radiographic staging system of Kellgren and Lawrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, all our patients were classified as having grade I-II disease of the femorotibial joint. In two cases (1 and 2), the lesion was considered to be primary (idiopathic). The lesion was secondary (acquired) in case 3 following a reconstruction for a depressed lateral fracture of the tibial plateau, augmented with synthetic bone graft. In all cases, the right knee was affected. The two primary cases had an oblique-type proximal TFJ articulation. No abnormal features of the proximal TFJ on the controlateral side were radiologically observed. None of the patients had a history of a neoplasm, metabolic disorder, infection, rheumatoid arthritis, or steroid use. All patients received conservative treatment including viscosupplement intra-articular injections. No specific measures were undertaken for the synostosis of the proximal TFJ. Progression of the degenerative changes was evaluated after a follow-up period that ranged from 2 to 4 years (mean 3 years). Total knee arthroplasty was not undertaken by that time and will be delayed as long as the use of nonoperative methods is considered satisfactory. The 3 cases are reported below in details.\n\n【7】Case 1. A man, aged 55 years, complained of peripatellar aching and pain on the medial aspect of the joint, which increased on walking in both knees.  \nOn palpation, patellar crepitation was noted with flexion and extension. Tenderness was present on the medial side of the joint over the medial collateral ligament and under the patella in both knees.  \nAnteroposterior and lateral standing radiographs of the long axis of both legs showed normal hip-knee-ankle alignment, no patellofemoral involvement, narrowing of the medial compartment space more pronounced on the left knee and synostosis of the proximal TFJ on the right knee . The fibula had normal length and shape and the position of the proximal TFJ was normal on both sides. The synostosis was considered to be complete and bony by a CT scan  and an MRI . At 4-year follow-up the degenerative changes exhibit similar progression on both knees . By that time, a severely reduced internal rotation of the right hip joint was diagnosed on clinical examination. Radiograph of the hips indicated narrowing of the joint space, subchondral sclerosis, cyst formation and osteophytes on the right side. No evidence of ankle arthritis was found.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | AP radiograph of both knees (a), CT (b), and MRI (c) examination, in a 55-year-old man, indicating synostosis of the proximal TFJ of the right knee initially, and 4 years later (d). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】Case 2. A 60-year-old woman was referred for pain on the medial aspect of both knees on walking. She had only slight pain going up and down stairs.  \nOn palpation, tenderness was located on the medial side of the joints and over the insertion of the semimembranosus tendon in both knees.  \nAnteroposterior and lateral standing radiographs of the long axis of both legs showed normal hip-knee-ankle alignment, no patellofemoral involvement, mild narrowing of the medial compartment space more pronounced on the right knee and synostosis of the right proximal TFJ . The fibula had normal length and shape and the position of the proximal TFJ was normal on both sides. The synostosis was confirmed to be complete and bony by a CT  and a 3D scan .  \nTwo years later her x-rays showed symmetrical progression of the degenerative changes. There was no evidence of osteoarthritic changes to the hips or ankles.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | AP radiograph of both knees (a), CT (b) and 3D (c) examination, in a 60-year-old woman, showing synostosis of the proximal TFJ of the right knee. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | AP radiograph of both knees (a), and CT (b,c) examination in a 69-year-old woman, revealing ectopic calcification of the proximal TFJ of the right knee. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】Case 3. A 69-year-old woman was presented with an 8-year history of a depressed fracture of the lateral tibial plateau of the right knee that was treated with open reduction, internal fixation, and was grafted with synthetic bone material. She complained of pain on walking in the right knee. She had also pain going up and down stairs.  \nOn palpation severe tenderness was present on the medial side of the right knee, especially at the femoral insertion of the medial collateral ligament.  \nAnteroposterior and lateral standing radiographs of the long axis of both legs showed normal hip-knee-ankle alignment, no patellofemoral involvement, narrowing of the medial compartment space and a calcium deposit of the medial collateral ligament at its femoral insertion of the right knee (Pellegrini-Stieda disease). The fibula had normal length and shape and the position of the proximal TFJ was normal on both sides. A synostosis of the proximal TFJ on the right knee was also evident . A CT scan confirmed partial synostosis that was characterized by the appearance of a large radiopaque mass in the area of the previously reduced and grafted fracture of the tibial plateau .  \nAt 3-year follow-up there was slight progression of the clinical findings and the radiographic degenerative changes. There was no evidence of hip or ankle osteoarthritis.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Tibiofibular synostosis has occasionally been described in the literature. It may be evident in one of the three joints that the tibia and fibula share.\n\n【15】Synostosis of the distal (inferior) TFJ is usually acquired-secondary to ankle fractures. It usually causes few symptoms and does not require any treatment in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, while in children the fibular growth may be altered leading to valgus alignment of the ankle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Synostosis of the middle TFJ (formed by the interosseous membrane) may be located at the level of the junction of the proximal and middle third of the tibia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> or at the middle and distal third of the tibia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Both cases that have been reported in the literature received surgical treatment.\n\n【16】Synostosis of the proximal TFJ has been reported in both children and adults. Whenever the synostosis is present from birth or occurs before the closure of the proximal tibial growth plate, it is usually symptomatic and may be associated with other growth deformities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Predisposing factors may include the syndrome of multiple hereditary exostoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 10\\]</u>, generalized syndromes, like the 49, XXXXY karotype, while the role of knee valgus is unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The absence of any growth abnormalities indicates that the synostosis occurred after physeal closure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Only 3 such patients have previously been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8, 9\\]</u>. On the other hand, synostosis of the proximal TFJ in adults is rarely associated with complaints and may, therefore, be easily missed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Two cases of symptomatic idiopathic synostosis of the proximal TFJ have been previously reported. One of them was a 24-year-old volley-ball player 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and the other one was a 45-year-old man with intermittent peroneal neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The only known reported case of asymptomatic secondary synostosis was a 14-year-old girl 5 years following tibial nailing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【19】All our patients had normal or near normal function and range of motion of the knees and also had no complaints due to the synostosis. The incidence of primary synostosis of the proximal TFJ in our series was 0.1% that is: 2 knees among 1029 patients (2058 knees). In our idiopathic cases (patients 1 and 2), the fibula had a normal length and shape, and the position of the proximal TFJ was normal. These findings indicated that the synostosis developed after the closure of the growth plates in adult life. The inclination of the TFJ surface in both these cases was of the oblique-type articulation, with an inclination of approximately 45 degrees. It is suggested that in the oblique-type articulation the load per surface area of the joint is increased resulting in higher pressure on cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This type of joint could also be more prone to degenerative changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. However, it is questionable whether the appearance of synostosis may, in any way, be affected by the inclination of the proximal TFJ.\n\n【20】The radiological appearance of the synostosis was complete and bony, and was similar in the idiopathic patients (cases 1 and 2), but was partial and appeared as a large radiopaque mass, compatible with ectopic calcification rather than ossification, in the acquired case (patient 3). The pathogenesis of this iatrogenic synostosis might be due to injury of the soft tissues and hemorrhage during surgery, or to the evacuation of a quantity of the synthetic bone graft.\n\n【21】We found no evidence that the synostosis was in any way associated with the onset or progression of osteoarthritic changes to the ipsilateral knee. Furthermore, the radiological assessment of both knees indicated more severe degenerative changes on the ipsilateral knee on two cases (patients 2 and 3) and on the contralateral healthy side in another one (case 1). No osteoarthritic changes were found radiologically in the hips in two patients (cases 2 and 3), while there were severe changes of the ipsilateral hip in one patient (case 1). There was no evidence of ankle arthritis in our patients.\n\n【22】In conclusion, the onset as well as the clinical and radiological progression of the degenerative changes of the knees, in all our 3 patients, was not, in any way, related to the unilateral proximal TFJ synostosis.\n\n【23】#### Conflict of Interest Statement\n\n【24】The author certifies that he has no commercial associations (such as consultancies, stock ownership, equity interest, patent/licensing arrangements, etc.) that might pose a conflict of interest in connection with the submitted article.

In addition to clinical cues, noninvasive modalities can play an important role in characterization of these masses and therefore their diagnosis and management planning.

Introduction\n\n【3】Cardiac masses were traditionally identified only during autopsy findings; however, with the advent of widely available noninvasive imaging techniques, their diagnosis has become easier and their management a reality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Advancements in these imaging modalities have led to tissue characterization and differentiation between different types of pathologies prior to their histological examination. In this case report, we describe the use of multimodality imaging techniques to differentiate between various forms of cardiac masses and how these helped in the diagnosis of the mass from the right ventricle.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A female patient in her 60s with a medical history of hypertension followed up with her primary care physician for an annual physical examination. Upon evaluation, the patient denied any complaints, and a review of the system was negative for any symptoms. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic murmur best heard at the apex. The rest of her examination and vitals were normal. The electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was ordered to evaluate the etiology of the systolic murmur which demonstrated moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and ejection fraction. A mobile, pedunculated mass was seen extending from the undersurface of the tricuspid annulus and traversing the pulmonic valve into the main pulmonary artery with mild right ventricular (RV) dilatation and hypokinesia . A gated computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest confirmed the RV mass with no evidence of pulmonary embolism or extra-cardiac extension . Patient was admitted for further evaluation and underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), which redemonstrated a large mobile and pedunculated mass measuring 8 by 3 cm in the RV protruding into the pulmonary artery (PA) during systole. The trans-gastric views demonstrated the attachment of the mass to the undersurface of the tricuspid annulus adjacent to the anterior tricuspid leaflet via a narrow stalk measuring 1.4 cm and extending 3-4 cm into the main pulmonary artery . The mass appeared lobulated with partial enhancement on injection of commercial echo contrast, thus helping us to exclude a thrombus. On cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), the mass was hypointense on the T1 sequence, had poor uptake on first-pass perfusion, and a heterogeneous uptake was on late gadolinium enhancement, which reflective of a benign tumor like myxoma . Given the large size, likely benign nature, and location of the tumor, the patient underwent surgical resection of the mass. Intraoperatively, the tumor was found to be soft and friable, extending into the PA, requiring dissection of the main PA to ensure complete retrieval of the mass into the right atrium . A partial tricuspid valve (TV) repair with an annuloplasty was also done. She had an uneventful course postoperatively. Patient has remained asymptomatic with no recurrence on follow-up echocardiogram 18 months after surgery.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Transthoracic echocardiogram showing RV mass.

Discussion\n\n【15】Cardiac masses are rare and may include tumors, thrombi, vegetations, or calcific lesions which unlike other organs can have severe hemodynamic consequences due to obstruction, embolism, electrical, or mechanical dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Cardiac myxomas are the most common benign primary cardiac neoplasm seen in adults. The majority arise from the left atrium attached to the interatrial septum with less than 5% ventricular in origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition to clinical cues, noninvasive cardiac imaging plays a major role in identification and diagnosis of cardiac masses. Basic measures such as TTE and TEE can help in the assessment of size, location, and mobility of a mass, and the added feature of 3-dimensional echocardiography can provide more accurate anatomical relationships. The addition of contrast agents can help assess the perfusion of the mass and differentiate between a thrombus (avascular) and a tumor (vascular) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In our patient the partially contrast-enhancing nature of the heterogeneous mass helped differentiate it as a tumor from a thrombus. TEE also helped in delineating anatomical relationships and guiding surgical access planning for retrieval of the mass.\n\n【16】Cardiac MRI with its tissue characterization and ability to provide information about extracardiac structures can help in assessing cardiac masses. First-pass perfusion to assess vascularity (high for vascular structures) and late gadolinium enhancement (absent in thrombus) can help to differentiate tumors from thrombus. T1 and T2 mapping along with other features can also help to differentiate between types of tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Cardiac CT can be used for more precise assessment of anatomical relations including extra-cardiac involvement but may not be required if other noninvasive measures are available. In our patient, heterogeneous late gadolinium enhancement, low first pass perfusion, and partial enhancement on injection of commercial echo contrast helped to exclude thrombus and identify the mass as a likely benign tumor as compared to a highly vascular lesion which has high first pass perfusion.\n\n【17】This case therefore not only describes a rare case of an incidental myxoma from the right ventricle but also shows how multimodality noninvasive imaging can be used to differentiate masses, aid in the management of these patients, and provide excellent correlation with histological diagnosis.\n\n【18】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】The imaging techniques guide in preoperative diagnosis and management of patients with an unidentified cardiac mass. Tissue characterization through multimodality imaging may provide an excellent correlation to the pathological diagnosis of a mass.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:01", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:08", "cost": 6.769}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:01"}

Glandular differentiation within these tumors is rare, occurring in approximately 3% of all cardiac myxomas. Its presence can complicate the diagnostic process. A 43-year-old Saudi male was referred with a two-month history of progressively increasing shortness of breath. Cardiovascular examination demonstrated a soft first heart sound with a plopping sound in the mitral area and a mid-diastolic murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large mass attached to the interatrial septum. A diagnosis of cardiac myxoma was made, and the patient underwent en bloc resection of the mass. Microscopic evaluation of the resected mass showed a neoplastic lesion with two components: first, a typical myxoma consisting of stellate and spindle cells in a myxomatous/hemorrhagic background; second, a glandular component consisting of separate, fused, and cribriform acini embedded within the myxomatous component. The acini were lined by a single row of columnar epithelial cells with basal nuclei and apical mucin. Occasional goblet cells were also identified. The postoperative period was uneventful, and on his recent follow-up in the clinic (nine months after the surgery), the patient is doing well with no complications. Herein, we emphasize the importance of accurately diagnosing such an entity, as it can be easily confused for a metastatic adenocarcinoma, especially in patients with a history of malignancy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Although a common entity among cardiac neoplasms, different histological presentations may hinder the diagnostic process. Among these is the presence of glandular differentiation in rare cardiac myxomas.

Herein, we report a case of left atrial myxoma with glandular differentiation, emphasizing its distinction from metastatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 43-year-old Saudi male was referred to the cardiology clinic with a two-month history of progressively increasing shortness of breath. On physical examination, he was anxious and relatively comfortable at rest. The chest was clear. Cardiovascular examination demonstrated a soft first heart sound with a plopping sound in the mitral area and a mid-diastolic murmur.\n\n【6】A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large mass attached to the interatrial septum .

Discussion\n\n【18】Cardiac myxoma, a primary heart tumor, is the most common benign cardiac tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It usually occurs in the atria (especially the left atrium) and presents with variable signs and symptoms ranging from an asymptomatic incidentally found lesion to shortness of breath, systemic embolization, syncope, or even death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–7\\]</u>. These different presentations can be explained by the tumor hemodynamic impact dictated by its location and proximity to heart valves and its propensity to embolize as determined by the texture of the tumor (solid and smooth-surfaced vs. irregular and friable).\n\n【19】Under the microscope, cardiac myxomas with glandular differentiation are composed of two components: first, the typical myxoma, which includes polygonal, spindle, and stellate cells in a myxomatous background; second, acini that are lined by columnar cells with or without pseudostratification; goblets cells could also be identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. The immunohistochemical profile of these acini in the presented case is quite intriguing. It is almost identical to the upper GIT epithelium, showing immunoreactivity for PAN-CK and CK7 while being negative for CK20 and CDX2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Glandular differentiation in cardiac myxoma is well documented in the literature, with fewer than fifty reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9–12\\]</u>. Up to our knowledge, including the presented case, forty-eight cases of glandular cardiac myxoma were reported in the English literature. Actually, glandular tissue is one of the different forms of tissues that can occur in cardiac myxomas, such as hematopoietic tissue, metaplastic bone, or thymic rests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 5, 7\\]</u>. Glandular differentiation, however, is rare in this commonly diagnosed cardiac lesion, encountered in approximately 3% of all cardiac myxomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In a large series studied by Chopra et al. out of 104 cases of cardiac myxoma, only three cases showed a glandular component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Identifying glandular elements in a cardiac myxoma as an integral component of the tumor is of paramount significance due to the resemblance of such elements to gastrointestinal (GIT) epithelium, being composed of acini lined by columnar cells and goblet cells capable of producing mucin just like colonic epithelium. Not only that but also the immunohistochemistry of these acini is almost identical to GIT epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 8\\]</u>. Consequently, the presence of such glandular elements in a location outside the GIT, such as the heart, can lead to misinterpretation of the lesion as a metastatic adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【22】As described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>, the primary differential diagnosis included metastatic adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma arising within cardiac myxoma. The patient was a 43-years-old man with a history of smoking; however, several elements favor the benign nature of glandular elements in this tumor. First, no previous history of malignancy and no evidence of occult tumor was found by radiology (CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis) and negative workup for other primary malignancies (for example, PSA and TTF-1 for carcinomas from prostate and lung, respectively). Second, the gross appearance of the lesion combined with the presence of typical myxoma cells in the background with the absence of necrosis, anaplastic features, mitosis, desmoplasia, and low mitotic index (Ki67 < 10%) of the glands. Third, the immunohistochemical profile is similar to the reported cases of glandular cardiac myxoma in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 8\\]</u>. All of these elements favor the benign nature of the lesion.\n\n【23】Indeed, occurrence in an old patient, a previous history of malignancy, a history of weight loss and anemia (which can occur due to the cardiac myxoma itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>), or the fact that the tumor can be fragile and embolize to different organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> are all factors that may blur the vision of the pathologist about the origin and nature of such a lesion and lead to an erroneous diagnosis of malignancy, especially if the patient had a previous history of adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Acknowledging the difficulty of differentiating glandular elements in cardiac myxoma from metastasis as outlined above, with careful gross and microscopic examination of the lesion, with thorough clinical and radiological workup to exclude malignancy elsewhere, can help to distinguish it from malignancy. The soft, gelatinous gross appearance, along with the absence of significant nuclear atypia, necrosis, mitosis, and desmoplasia, along with the presence of the typical myxoma component, all stand against the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】We report a case of a 43-year-old male diagnosed with cardiac myxoma with glandular differentiation. Up to our knowledge, this is the first case to be reported from Saudi Arabia. Due to the rarity of such a lesion, we emphasize to the pathologist the importance of accurately diagnosing this entity, which can be confused for metastatic adenocarcinoma, especially in patients with a history of malignancy.\n\n【27】#### Abbreviations\n\n| CDX2: | Caudal-type homeobox 2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| CEA: | Carcinoembryonic antigen |\n| CK 7: | Cytokeratin 7 |\n| CK 5/6: | Cytokeratin 5/6 |\n| CK 19: | Cytokeratin 19 |\n| CK 20: | Cytokeratin 20 |\n| CT: | Computerized tomography |\n| EMA: | Epithelial membrane antigen |\n| GIT: | Gastrointestinal |\n| H&E: | Hematoxylin and eosin |\n| PAS: | Periodic acid–Schiff |\n| PSA: | Prostate-specific antigen |\n| TTF-1: | Thyroid transcription factor 1. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:05:56", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:06:11", "cost": 15.115}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:06:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:05:55"}

Inflammatory pseudo-tumors (IPT) of the liver are rare and difficult to diagnose, because mimicking malignant tumors. Aim. We report a case of IPT of the liver wich diagnosis was made on clinical, radiological and evolutif features. Observation. A 15-year-old man had a 4-month history of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant with fever and cought. Two successives ultrasonographies revealed a hypoechoic lesion occuping the segment VIII with 8 cm of diametre. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory investigation showed normal blood counts, liver function test and tumoral markers. Another ultrasonography was interpretated as normal. Tomodensitometry had showon a 3-cm lesion wich enhanced later after contrast injection. A second tomodensitometry done one mounth later described a 2-cm sub capsular heaptic lesion. Discussion. On routine activiy, pre operative diagnosis of IPT of the liver is difficut, and rarely made with certitude because mimicking a malignant tumor. In our cae report here, the analysis of previous history, of clinical, biological and radiological presentation, had permittes us to pose the diagnosis of PTI of the liver and this despite the absence of histological confirmation by percutaneous biopsy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver (IPLs) are fibroblastic proliferations more or less fibrous, infiltrated by polymorphic inflammatory cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. They are not so rare since the literature showed many edifying examples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Their better characterization with the morphological examinations had permitted us these last years to make the diagnosis more often. This stresses, especially in face of the great progress realized in the field of surgery of malignant hepatic tumors, the great importance to pay attention to IPLs which the evolution is benign and does not necessitate any intervention. Thus, it is crucial to put on the right diagnosis and prevent unnecessary hepatic resection.\n\n【4】Hereby we present another case of spontaneous regression of IPL in which we recall diagnostic and evolutionary modalities.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】We report a case of 15-year-old young man otherwise healthy who complains for 4 months of right upper quadrant pain accompanied with high fever and productive cough. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of the right diaphragmatic dome . Abdominal ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic and heterogeneous mass, measuring 8 cm in diameter, localized in the hepatic dome . At his admission, the physical examination was normal. White blood cell count was 7500; c-reactive protein was normal too. Hepatic function test and tumor markers were within normal range (AFP and CEA).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Elevation of the right diaphragmatic dome. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Hypoechoic and heterogeneous mass, localized in the hepatic dome. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】Abdominal tomography revealed a subcapsular lesion occupying segments VII and VIII and measuring 4 cm in diameter spontaneously hypodense and having slight peripheral enhancement at delayed stage .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | CT scan showing subcapsular lesion occupying segment VII and VIII and measuring 4 cm in diameter spontaneously low attenuated and having slight peripheral enhancement at delayed stage. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】A second tomography done one month later described the same lesion with the same characteristics but with a dramatic decrease in size which is evaluated to be 2 cm in diameter . This spontaneous regression in size associated with radiological characteristics of a partially fibrous lesion permitted us to make the diagnosis of IPL and to abstain from any therapeutics. The patient is doing well and another radiologic control is foreseen in 6 months.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | CT scan showing a decrease in tumor size which is evaluated to be 2 cm. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】The pathogenesis of IPL remains uncertain. It would be in relation with an exaggerated or inadequate inflammatory response of an existing microorganism in the portal circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Abbey-Toby et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> distinguished two clinicopathological entities which have different clinical and radiological forms: the first one consists of both fusiform cells and inflammatory polymorphic cells associated with adjacent fibrous portal endophlebitis and accompanied besides that by an inflammatory syndrome. In return, the second form which is encapsulated has abundant central necrosis and it is always clinically asymptomatic. It would be the result of a chronic inflammatory processes and this corresponds to the healing version of IPL. This evolutionary form explains the diminution in size lesion observed in our patient. This evoked several reported cases in literature where regression of IPL either spontaneously or by an anti-inflammatory or antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5–11\\]</u> is reported.\n\n【15】Since the IPL are known as benign lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and that its natural history progresses towards regression, it is essential to make the exact diagnosis and to not consider it as a malignant tumor that may lead to unnecessary resection. However, diagnosis is not easy due to the absence of specific radiological signs and to the variability of the radiologic aspects which are related to the evolutionary stage of IPL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In the current case, the main characteristic that helped to make the diagnosis is the regression of the tumor size on two successive CT scan. The diagnosis should be discussed also when a liver mass has the characteristics of a lesion with a fibrous component with late contrast or necrotic. Indeed, the IPL is hypoechoic on US and has well-defined borders. On noncontrast CT study, the lesion reveals low attenuation and a moderate enhancement following contrast administration in the periphery and in late stage. On MRI, IPL is frequently hypointense in T1-weighted images, hyperintense in T2-weighted images, and of heterogenic uptake after gadolinium injection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However, these features are variable and the diagnosis is often evoked in the absence of signs for common benign and malignant liver lesions .\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Imaging features of common hepatic lesions.</u>\n\n【17】In terms of radiologic analysis, the diagnosis of IPL should be evoked every time that we are faced with partially fibrous hepatic mass with late uptake of contrast material and in absence of signs for specific hepatic tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In this stage the diagnosis may be put on by the presence of regression in size of the hepatic mass as it was the case for our patient and two other cases reported by Yamaguchi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In total, the combination of radiologic suggestive signs on CT scan with a regression of tumor size on successive morphological examinations eliminates all differential diagnoses and can retain the diagnosis of IPT. Otherwise, in the absence of one of these criteria, percutaneous needle biopsy of the tumor is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The pathologic diagnosis is based on the presence of densely hyalinized collagenous tissue with an inflammatory infiltrate of predominantly plasma cells. Some portions of the stroma show fibroblasts in interlacing laminated or whorled patterns. Typical changes are seen in large and medium-sized veins with inflammation involving the vessel walls and filling of the lumen with connective tissue containing capillaries and inflammatory cells. Many veins show complete obliteration of the lumen. In contrast, arteries show no major alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【18】It has not been established whether steroid administration accelerates resolution of IPL but it may reduce the systemic symptoms of the inflammatory syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Most often the tumor regresses spontaneously and only a radiological monitoring should be introduced until complete healing of the lesion.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】The IPL are benign lesions which show spontaneous regression. The preoperative diagnosis is difficult since the radiological presentation is taken for a malignant tumor. Attention should always be paid in case of partially fibrous hepatic mass with late contrast uptake and without any specific sign in order to avoid any unnecessary surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:46", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:16:54", "cost": 367.491}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:16:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:45"}

Due to the high fatal potential of the disease complications, the radiologist should distinguish necrotizing fasciitis from the most common soft tissue infections, in order to permit a prompt surgical and medical treatment. We present a case of a wide necrotizing fasciitis who presented at our emergency department and we also provide the basic tools, through a review of the literature, for the general radiologist to distinguish, with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, necrotizing fasciitis from the most common infections that could present during our routine practice.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Necrotizing infectious fasciitis (NIF) is a rare disease; incidence of necrotizing fasciitis has been reported to be between 500 and 1500 cases per year in the United States. It is a rare infection of the deeper layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues, easily spreading across the fascial plane within the subcutaneous tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The increase in the modern society of favouring factors such as diabetes and primary and secondary immunological disorders made the disease a reality that should be known both from the radiologist and from the clinician.\n\n【4】#### 2\\.

Follow-Up\n\n【27】After the surgery clinical conditions of the patient suddenly improved; antibiotics were administrated for two weeks and no other radiological exams were performed.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【29】##### 3.1. Etiology and Demographics\n\n【30】Necrotizing infectious fasciitis (NIF) is a rare disease; incidence of necrotizing fasciitis has been reported to be between 500 and 1500 cases per year in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【31】NIF is a life-threatening, soft-tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading inflammation and necrosis of the skin, involving the subcutaneous tissues and fascia due to the spread of the bacteria among and inside the skin surface. When necrosis is present, it is called NIF; otherwise in all other cases where inflammation of the deep fascia and subcutaneous tissue is present, but there was not a demonstrable necrosis, it is called non-NIF. To distinguish NIF from non-NIF is a fundamental key point due to the different treatment strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【32】NIF was first described by Joseph Jons, an American army surgeon during the American Civil War, and was popularized in the lay media during the 1980s after an increase in prevalence was said to be caused by “flesh-eating bacteria.” The clinical disease is expressed when infective organisms spread through the tissue along the deep fascia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【33】The disease may occur if the right set of conditions are present; these include an opening in the skin that allows bacteria to enter the body such as surgical wounds, bite of animals, scratches, burns, puncture needles, and skin open trauma.\n\n【34】Risk factors for the disease are diabetes, chronic disease, immunosuppressive drugs, malnutrition, age > 60 years, intravenous drug misuse, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, primary and secondary immunological disorders, and underlying malignancy and obesity.\n\n【35】Microbiologically, NIF has been classified as either type I (polymicrobial), type II (monomicrobial), or type III (gas gangrene) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Polymicrobial infections are more common, with cultures yielding a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. The etiologic isolates consist of Gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. pyogenes, and enterococci; Gram-negative aerobes such as Escherichia Coli and Pseudomonas species; and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides or Clostridium species. Type 1 NIF occurs in immunocompromised individuals. Monomicrobial infections are less common than the polymicrobial variety.\n\n【37】The mortality rate may be high as 30%–70% with death being due to sepsis, respiratory failure, kidney failure, or multiorgan system failure.\n\n【38】Studies have shown that only 15% to 34% of patients with NIF have an accurate admitting diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【39】##### 3.2. Clinical and Imaging Findings\n\n【40】###### 3.2.1. Clinical\n\n【41】Patients with NIF can present with constitutional symptoms of sepsis alone or with evidence of skin inflammation, which makes diagnosis a little more straightforward.\n\n【42】The most common signs of skin inflammation in NIF are skin localized pain, skin edema, and erythema with a patchy discoloration of the skin. The skin usually appeared swollen and mottled and a sense of crackling snow suggestive for the presence of subcutaneous gas could be present.\n\n【43】Progression of NIF is marked with the development of tense edema, a grayish-brown discharge, vesicles bullae, necrosis, and crepitus that are clear signs of the skin necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Hemorrhagic bullae and crepitus are sinister signs, with the likelihood of underlying fascia and muscle being compromised.\n\n【45】The physical examination should include all parts of the body to investigate for skin inflammation.\n\n【46】With the spread of the disease among the tissues constitutional symptoms occur such as fever, tachycardia, altered mental state, and diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n【47】Leukocytosis with neutrophilia, acidosis, altered coagulation profile, impaired renal function, raised creatine kinase levels, and raised inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein levels, are helpful if viewed within the whole of the clinical context. We should also remember that clinical scores like the indicator for NIF (LRINEC score) are available to help diagnosis of NIF and differentiate it from other skin and soft tissue infections. Blood cultures and tissue cultures should be performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【48】###### 3.2.2. Imaging Findings\n\n【49】X-rays films do not play a fundamental role in the diagnosis and management of NIF because they could just reveal the presence of subcutaneous gas; thus they could be helpful in the follow-up of the patients in order to monitor the evolution of subcutaneous gas.\n\n【50】CT imaging is a helpful tool in distinguishing NIF from the most common infections of the soft tissues such as cellulitis, nonnecrotizing fasciitis, soft tissues abscess, infectious myositis, and osteomyelitis where there is an involvement of the bone adjacent to the infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【51】Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermis and of the subcutaneous tissues and usually does not involve the fascia. CT demonstrates skin thickening, septation of the subcutaneous fat, and thickening of the underlying superficial fascia. On MRI these alterations of the dermis and of subcutaneous tissues could be detected as linear streaks or as focal areas of alteration of signal, hyperintense on T2-WI and hypointense in T1-WI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Usually in cellulitis there is a thickening of subcutaneous tissues with fluid collections in the subcutaneous fat layer detected as areas of hyperintensity on T2-WI; the deeper fascia is not involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【52】In complicated cellulitis the deeper structures and the fascia could be involved and necrotizing fasciitis should be suspected.\n\n【53】The imaging findings in necrotizing fasciitis are similar to those in cellulitis but are more severe and the involvement of the fascia and of the deeper muscular structures is always present, while in cellulitis it is not a common finding.\n\n【54】One specific distinguishing sign of necrotizing fasciitis is the presence of gas in the subcutaneous tissues caused by gas-forming anaerobic organisms. In a study written by Yu and Habib, it is reported that the presence of gas in the subcutaneous tissues caused by gas-forming anaerobic organisms is a specific sign of NIF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【55】CT enables excellent and fast visualization of the subcutaneous gas and in the evaluation of this finding it is dramatically superior compared with MRI. On MRI gas collections result in focal foci of signal void both in T1-WI and T2-WI and it could be difficult to detect them.\n\n【56】Other CT findings in NIF include thickening of the affected fascia, fluid collections along the deep fascial sheaths, and extension of edema into the intramuscular septa and the muscles, findings that were present in the case we presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>.\n\n【57】To determine if necrosis is present the administration of contrast medium could be a helpful tool that helps to distinguish the necrotic fascial tissue from the nonnecrotic one. The literature shows evidences that when necrosis is present, on CECT in the delayed phase, a lack of the enhancement of the fascia could be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. In our case we performed an early venous phase, so we could not express any definitive consideration about the enhancement of the fascia.\n\n【58】Regarding the lack of enhancement of the fascia, we have also to say that it could not be considered as a certain predictor factor of necrosis. In fact in some studies, where the efficacy of the findings predictive of NIF was studied with MRI which is more contrast sensitive to CT, a lack of enhancement of the fascia was observed not just in the patients affected by NIF but also in some patients not affected by NIF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. So the lack of enhancement of the fascia, both on CECT and on MRI, could not be considered as a certain predictor factor of necrosis but should be considered as a suggestive predictive factor of necrosis according to the other radiological and clinical findings.\n\n【59】Soft tissue abscess presents a well-demarcated fluid collection with a peripheral pseudocapsule showing ring enhancement on CECT and due to these characteristics it could be easily distinguished from cellulitis and fasciitis.\n\n【60】On MRI soft tissue abscess shows low signal intensity (SI) on T1-WI and intermediate-high SI on T2-WI, sometimes with T2 hypointense lower SI layering debris. Thick peripheral rim enhancement, with or without a central hypointensity, in a case of abscess is present after contrast medium administration on T1-WI fat sat postcontrast sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Calcifications and gas collections could be also present in abscesses and the best technique to evaluate these two findings, as said before, is CT. MRI calcifications result in a signal loss in T2-WI and T1-WI but they are not easily and readily demonstrable as on CT. To evaluate the presence of edema, which could be present both in muscular infections and in abscesses, Short Time Inversion Recovery Sequences (STIR) should be performed. STIR sequences, which are T2-weighted sequences, reveal the presence of edema as an area with increased signal intensity compared to the normal tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【61】When there is an infectious myositis, on CT, there are enlargement and decreased attenuation of the affected muscle with effacement of surrounding planes. Involvement of a muscle group that is disproportionate to the involvement of subcutaneous tissue helps distinguish myositis from primary cellulitis. Intramuscular fluid collections can be also present in infectious myositis; the administration of contrast medium could help to differentiate necrotic from viable musculature and to demonstrate if a rim enhancing abscess is present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【62】On MRI in case of infectious pyomyositis, hyperintense focal lesions on T2-WI with massive perifocal edema resulting in a hyperintensity on the STIR sequences could be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【63】When there is an involvement of adjacent bone osteomyelitis can occur. A periosteal reaction, medullary low-attenuation areas, trabecular coarsening, and focal erosions are CT signs of osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【64】On CT, features of osteomyelitis include also soft tissue swelling, periosteal reaction, medullary low-attenuation areas or trabecular coarsening, and focal cortical erosions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【65】On MRI, in a case of acute osteomyelitis, sites of involved medullary bone appeared on T1-WI as areas of ill-defined homogenous, low to-intermediate signal intensity, and on T2-WI as areas of high signal intensity and as bright as or brighter than bone marrow. On T1-WI images there are accompanying areas of ill-defined intermediate signal intensity in the cortex and soft tissue and disruption on the normal high-intensity signal of the adjacent intramuscular septa and subcutaneous fat. These foci changed to high signal intensity on T2-WI images just as the lesions in the medullary canal had 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【66】Therefore the involvement and the thickening of the fascia, fluid collections, presence of subcutaneous gas, edema of the muscular septa, the involvement of the subcutaneous tissue, a nonenhancing fascia after contrast medium administration, and areas of low-attenuation in the muscles and among the soft tissues are all findings that together with the clinical history of the patient could suggest to the radiologist the presence of NIF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8–10\\]</u>. Other signs of systemic infection, such as pleural effusion or the hyperdensity of the fat mesenteric tissue, as seen in our case could be present in NIF when a systemic reaction is present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8–10\\]</u>.\n\n【67】In case of NIF, MRI imaging could be a useful tool in the evaluation of the precise extent of the infection and of its relations with the surrounding organs, to distinguish mild fascial or muscle involvement and to determine, with a higher sensibility compared to the CT scan, if necrosis and edema are present or not. Generally fat-suppressed T2-WI has been found to display inflammatory changes better than fat-suppressed gadolinium-enhanced T1-WI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. On MRI scan patients with NIF usually present thick (>3 mm) areas with abnormal high signal intensity on fat-suppressed T2-WI in the deep fascia, with a less frequency combined areas in superficial and deep fascia of low signal intensity on fat-sat T2-WI; a focal or diffuse nonenhancing portion in the area of the high abnormal signal intensity, in the deep fascia, in T1-WI fat sat postcontrast images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. Regarding the presence of a focal or diffuse nonenhancing portion after contrast medium administration on T1-WI fat-sat postcontrast images, it applies the considerations said above in the text.\n\n【68】MRI is a second stage exam that could be performed in all those doubt cases, after a first CECT evaluation, to distinguish NIF from non-NIF. MRI is dramatically inferior compared to CT in the evaluation of the presence of subcutaneous gas and calcifications. MRI is more contrast sensitive compared to CT; it permits a better evaluation of the precise extent of the disease and it offers an important diagnostic adjunct to the management of NIF and the potential to defer or limit extensive exposure of the deep fascia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. Nuclear imaging studies (99 mTC-Phosphate Complex and 67 Ga) are useful in those cases where a complication of osteomyelitis is suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【69】##### 3.3. Treatment and Prognosis\n\n【70】Once the diagnosis is made, treatment must begin on multiple fronts.\n\n【71】First, surgical consultation should be urgently requested with the intention of early wound debridement for collection of tissue cultures, excision of all nonviable and necrotic tissues should be done, and delineation of the extent of the disease tissues should be done. If the necrosis is present or strongly suspected, both with clinical examination and with the radiological findings, surgical debridement is mandatory.\n\n【72】In NIF a surgical debridement is mandatory; nonnecrotizing fasciitis does not require emergency surgery but affected patients should be monitored because of the potential necrosis.\n\n【73】Until blood culture results are available, wide spectrum antibiotic coverage with intravenous administration should be started.\n\n【74】The antibiotic should cover pyogenes, aureus, and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes as clinically indicated.\n\n【75】Hyperbaric oxygen has also been used as an adjunct to surgery and antibiotics.\n\n【76】Mortality due to NIF is considerable. Without surgical interventions, mortality approaches 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. More recent data indicate a mortality of 16,4% for community-acquired necrotizing soft tissue infections and 36,3% for postprocedural necrotizing fasciitis infections. Mortality is higher in patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and in diabetic patients.\n\n【77】A delay to surgery of more than 24 hours was an independent risk factor for mortality. There is also considerable postoperative morbidity, sometimes from extensive debridement resulting in muscle or limb loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【78】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【79】In conclusion, even if the diagnosis of NIF is both clinical and radiological, in the literature there are specific CT and MRI signs that allow the radiologist to distinguish NIF from non-NIF and from the most common musculoskeletal infections in order to perform a prompt surgical intervention when NIF is suspected.\n\n【80】Both techniques, CT and MRI, as said before have their weak and strength points, and as a general consideration we can say that CECT should be performed as first stage exam following with MRI in the doubt cases.\n\n【81】Some predisposing factors such as diabetes, previous surgery, or wounds in the skins should alert the radiologist of the possible presence of deep muscular infections.\n\n【82】The main goal for the radiologist at the emergency department when a deep muscular infection is suspected is to distinguish NIF from nonnecrotizing fasciitis and from other musculoskeletal infections and to evaluate the extension of the disease, the presence of necrosis if it is possible, and the disease complications both local and systemic.\n\n【83】#### 5\\.

Typically, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) mediates this platelet clumping. PTCP has little clinical significance, but misdiagnosis may lead to unnecessary diagnostic tests and treatment. In this case report, we present a 65-year-old Caucasian female suffering from multiple complications during and after cardiac surgery. During her postoperative stay at the ICU, she was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia and an inadequate response to platelet supplementation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 65-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the General Hospital of Vienna with the diagnosis of a combined high-grade mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency, persisting atrial fibrillation, and a hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Surgical reconstruction of the mitral and tricuspid valve, as well as a left atrial appendage (LAA) resection, was indicated and performed. An intraoperative rupture of the left atrium led to two periods of cardiopulmonary bypass and the consecutive implantation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to impaired right ventricular function. After the surgical procedure, the patient was transferred to the ICU, where she required high doses of catecholamine support and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) due to acute renal failure. On postoperative day (POD) 7, ECMO weaning was successful, and the therapy was finally stopped. Initially, anticoagulation therapy consisted of unfractionated heparin and was switched to low-molecular-weight heparin after ECMO explantation. On POD 8, a complete blood count (CBC) showed a reduced platelet count of 39 G/L . 4Ts score for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was 5, which represented an intermediate probability of HIT. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIT was negative (Zymutest HIA IgG, Hyphen Biomed, Neuville sur Oise, France), and a viscoelastic test of a whole blood sample (rotational thromboelastometry, ROTEM) showed no abnormalities, moreover, a procoagulant state despite the low numeric platelet count . Physical examination did not reveal any signs of hemorrhagic diathesis. Platelet count could not be significantly increased by the transfusion of two units of platelet concentrates. The platelet count after the first transfusion was 28 G/L, and the platelet count after the second transfusion on the following day was 24 G/L. On POD 10, CBC was reevaluated by using sodium citrate tubes instead of EDTA tubes, revealing a platelet count of 216 G/L . Since PTCP was diagnosed two days after the first low platelet count and the patient was critically ill and on continuous ECMO therapy, other causes of thrombocytopenia such as immune thrombocytopenia were not evaluated further. During the patient’s stay at our ICU, platelet count was also checked with a specific blood collection tube (ThromboExact, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) confirming the results collected with the citrated blood tubes.\n\n【4】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Postoperative platelet count with different blood collection tubes (EDTA, Sodium Citrate, Magensium sulfate) as shown.</u>\n\n【5】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) showing a procoagulant state despite the low numeric platelet count.</u>\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【7】Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count lower than 150 G/L. A platelet count lower than 100 G/L is considered to imply medium to high bleeding risk, depending on the particular platelet count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The diagnosis of thrombocytopenia usually includes a repetition of the complete blood count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>, the white blood cell differential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, a peripheral blood smear, and the evaluation of possible hematological abnormalities. If none of these tests are indicative for a genuine thrombocytopenia or a malignant hematological disease, PTCP can be the cause for low platelet count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【8】PTCP is an analytical error in automated blood cell counting. Blood samples which contain autoantibodies against thrombocytes and are collected in EDTA-containing tubes can lead to platelet clumping. Agglutinated platelets are detected as larger cells by using automated counters and lead to false low results. This phenomenon was discovered early after the invention of laboratory medicine automation and was described precisely soon after 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【9】The incidence of severe thrombocytopenia (<100 G/L) among the population of critically ill patients is 7.8% and therefore a very likely diagnosis. This could mislead clinicians in cases of PTCP and result in overtreatment with the administration of platelet concentrates or even more invasive procedures such as splenectomy. Other rare causes of thrombocytopenia such as HIT were found to be 0.3% in this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, whereas the incidence of PTCP is suggested to range from 0.09 to 0.15% in routine clinical blood samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Unfortunately, data of PTCP in a critically ill population are lacking, but given the data, one can assume that the likelihood of other more clinically relevant causes of thrombocytopenia, even if it is still very small (HIT 0.3%), is higher than to suffer from PTCP. Therefore, clinicians are concerned with the diagnostics of the more severe forms of thrombocytopenia and are not aware about analytical errors since the repetition of the specimen often confirms the result.\n\n【10】As mentioned above, PTCP is induced by the cross-reaction of EDTA and platelet autoantibodies which cause the agglutination of platelets in the sample 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This phenomenon is not only restricted to EDTA but also present with other anticoagulants such as sodium oxalate, sodium citrate, and heparin, making it more difficult to diagnose PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Recently, there are increasing numbers of reports portraying this multi-anticoagulant PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. Additives mixed with EDTA specimens, i.e. aminoglycosides such as kanamycin and amikacin, can prevent the agglutination of platelets and dissociate platelet clumps if added after blood withdrawal and could therefore be a helping agent in diagnostics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. Unfortunately, there have been reports on the unreliability of these effects in certain cases of PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Another possible solution of the problem could be the utilization of magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) as an anticoagulant. Before laboratory medicine automation, MgSO<sub>4</sub> was widely used to prevent blood cell agglutination but was replaced by EDTA after the invention of automated cell counting because of the more convenient use as spray-dried coat in blood collection tubes. It is now suggested to reconsider MgSO<sub>4</sub> as an anticoagulant in diagnostics of multiple-anticoagulant PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. By now, blood collection tubes containing MgSO<sub>4</sub> as an anticoagulant additive are available commercially (ThromboExact, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) and were used in this presented case to confirm the results, which were collected in citrated blood tubes.\n\n【11】The induction of autoantibodies reacting with EDTA and platelets is not resolved but very likely induced over a period of medical treatment. An early work on the patient population (18 patients) presenting with PTCP found that, at hospital admission, 61% of all patients had a platelet count over 100 G/L, which then deteriorated over their hospital stay. Furthermore, they found that 55% of the study population were treated at an intensive care unit, 22% suffered from neoplastic diseases, and another 22% suffered from atherosclerosis-related conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. However, newer investigations could not reveal a correlation between these clinical characteristics and the development of PTCP, except for receiving medical treatment within a short period of time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The assumption of antibodies being the cause of this phenomenon was communicated early after the introduction of PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The detection of specific antibodies took place in the mid-90s. Platelet agglutination is induced by a variety of immunoglobulins including IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies, which bind to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the platelet surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【13】There are growing numbers of reported PTCP caused by a variety of therapies and diseases. In some cases, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors seems to be responsible for PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>, as well as direct glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists such as abciximab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Furthermore, there have been reports on PTCP in COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. It seems that multiple medical treatments, diseases, and infections can induce PTCP.\n\n【14】It is therefore important to raise awareness throughout the clinical and scientific societies to consider PTCP as differential diagnosis early after the onset of low platelet counts without clinical symptoms of hemorrhagic diathesis. With cases of multi-anticoagulant PTCP, it is getting more difficult to detect false low platelet counts, and appropriate diagnostic facilities (peripheral blood smear, ThromboExact blood tubes) need to be available for correct diagnosis. Considering these challenges, it can be difficult in clinical settings to thoroughly evaluate causes of thrombocytopenia, but one should consequently pursue the process of finding the right diagnosis since the clinical consequences of overtreatment can be dramatic, i.e. splenectomy. In this case report, the challenge of finding the right diagnosis was the complexity of the case. Thrombocytopenia is not uncommon after cardiac surgery and on ECMO therapy. A bleeding tendency is often present because of deranged coagulation factors and mass transfusions. Since our department is very skilled and trained in the management and diagnosis of bleeding disorders, our patient was diagnosed with PTCP shortly after the onset of severe thrombocytopenia (two days after first severe low platelet counts). Further invasive treatment could be averted from the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:26:40", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:27:40", "cost": 60.241}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:27:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:26:40"}

Peripheral blood smear examination is an invaluable laboratory test, which provides the complete hematologic and/or nonhematologic picture of a case. In addition to verifying the results of automated cell counters, it has the potential to identify some pathologic and morphologic changes that remain hidden using the cell counters alone. Case Presentation. A 40-year-old man with a three-year history of alcohol intake and marijuana abuse presented with severe lower extremities of the bone and abdominal pain. Physical examination showed high blood pressure, high pulse rate, and abdominal tenderness. He underwent extensive laboratory and imaging tests, and cholecystectomy and bone marrow studies were associated with no definite diagnosis. Right after all these invasive, expensive, and time-consuming investigations during a month, finding coarse basophilic stippling in the red blood cells in the peripheral blood smear by an expert led to the final diagnosis. Elevated blood lead level and the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow study confirmed the diagnosis of lead poisoning, and the patient responded well to chelator therapy in a short period. Conclusion. This case clearly showed the value of peripheral blood smear review and its impact on patient care. In order not to lose the cases, laboratories are recommended to design their own policy for peripheral blood smear review. The peripheral blood smear is the fastest, simplest, and most available screening test, which can prevent many misdiagnoses and malpractices. It provides rich morphological information, among which basophilic stippling is highly suggestive of lead poisoning.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】A manual blood smear review is defined as the thorough and careful microscopic analysis of a well-prepared and stained smear of peripheral blood, with the objective of seeking morphological changes relevant to the diagnosis and monitoring of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Laboratory-initiated examinations of blood smears for patients with anemia are usually the result of a laboratory policy, according to which a blood smear is ordered whenever the hemoglobin concentration is unexpectedly low. In these cases, despite the wealth of the captured information from modern automated cell counters, including red cell count, mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and red cell distribution width (RDW), there are still morphologic abnormalities that are critical in the differential diagnosis of anemia and can be determined only from a blood smear. The detection of variations in the cell shape and red cell inclusions, such as Howell–Jolly bodies, Pappenheimer bodies, and basophilic stippling or punctate basophilia, is highly important. The latter can be suggestive of lead poisoning according to the clinical data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 40-year-old man was transferred to our center at Abu Ali Sina Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, to be evaluated for severe bone pain and abdominal pain for a month, which was worsened one week ago. It was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and constipation. The patient was also complaining of severe weight loss (15 kg during a month). His past medical history was not significant, and he was not taking any medication. He was a fast-food worker with a history of excessive alcohol intake over three years, with no periods of abstinence. He was drinking 1-2 liters of homemade alcohol (using a traditional container for distillation) daily until few days prior to admission. Additionally, he reported a history of on and off synthetic marijuana abuse until three days prior to admission. The bone pain was mostly limited to the lower extremities, and the abdominal pain was severe with a colicky pattern and radiation to both scrotums. Physical examination was significant for high blood pressure (180/100 mmHg), tachycardia (108/min), low-grade fever (37.9°C), and pallor with abdominal and scrotal tenderness. There was no gingival hyperpigmentation, and all deep tendon reflexes were unremarkable.\n\n【6】Laboratory investigations at presentation showed moderate microcytic and hemolytic anemia in addition to significantly elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Abdominopelvic sonography and CT scan showed biliary sludge and small liver hemangioma, respectively. Other laboratory and imaging investigations (color Doppler sonography of the mesenteric artery and vein, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and colonoscopy) were unremarkable. He underwent cholecystectomy with the impression of acute cholecystitis, and the microscopic pathologic diagnosis was just chronic cholecystitis without cholelithiasis. Due to the presence of unexplained anemia and severe bone pain, a bone marrow study was done for him to rule out leukemia, which was in favor of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with 10% ring sideroblasts . The cytogenetic study was normal. Complete blood count (CBC) test with peripheral blood smear (PBS) checking (according to our policy in the hematology laboratory) was done for the patient several times at presentation and during hospitalization. Peripheral blood film examinations, stained by the Wright–Giemsa method, revealed mild to moderate anemia, microcytic hypochromic red blood cells with anisocytosis, polychromasia, and also frequent coarse basophilic stippling of the red cells ; the last one was missed at the first PBS review. Regarding the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow report, the possibility of lead poisoning was considered, and surprisingly, the blood lead level (measured on K2EDTA-whole blood by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) was markedly raised (151 µg/dL; reference range was 10 µg/dL). Since there was no occupational exposure, the traditional distillation dish (made of copper and lead) was traced as the possible source of lead.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bone marrow smear showing that about 10% of erythroid precursors are ring sideroblasts (arrow) (Perl’s Prussian blue stain, ×1000).</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a, b) Peripheral blood smear with basophilic stippling of red blood cells  (Wright–Giemsa, ×1000).</u>\n\n【9】The patient stopped drinking alcohol and marijuana abuse. Chelating therapy with succimer was initiated with a dose of 500 mg (5 capsules) daily, and after four weeks, the blood lead level declined to 25 µg/dl, and he had a weight gain of 6 kg. All signs and symptoms were removed, and all laboratory findings changed to normal condition. Additionally, no clinical or laboratory deficits were noted during the 6-month follow-up visits. Informed consent was requested and obtained from the patient for publishing the case report and the accompanying images. Although some reports are supporting the correlation between hypertension and lead poisoning, in our case, marijuana withdrawal could also be the cause of sympathetic overactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Table 1 shows the transition of laboratory data from the first presentation to recovery time.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 The initial and posttreatment results (after 4 weeks) of the laboratory tests.</u>\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】CBC is the most commonly ordered test in hospitalized patients. Modern automated blood cell counters produce a detailed report on the red cells, white cells, and platelets, with differential white blood cell counts. A drop of the remaining blood could then be smeared and stained 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Microscopic examination of this smear under the expert eye yields useful information and further details regarding all formed elements of blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. “More information can be gained from examining the blood smear than any other single hematologic procedure,” Jandl in 1987 said 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This shows the value of PBS review in medical management. Initiation of a PBS review depends on the laboratory policy.

Peripheral blood smear examination is an invaluable laboratory test, which provides the complete hematologic and/or nonhematologic picture of a case. In addition to verifying the results of automated cell counters, it has the potential to identify some pathologic and morphologic changes that remain hidden using the cell counters alone. Case Presentation. A 40-year-old man with a three-year history of alcohol intake and marijuana abuse presented with severe lower extremities of the bone and abdominal pain. Physical examination showed high blood pressure, high pulse rate, and abdominal tenderness. He underwent extensive laboratory and imaging tests, and cholecystectomy and bone marrow studies were associated with no definite diagnosis. Right after all these invasive, expensive, and time-consuming investigations during a month, finding coarse basophilic stippling in the red blood cells in the peripheral blood smear by an expert led to the final diagnosis. Elevated blood lead level and the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow study confirmed the diagnosis of lead poisoning, and the patient responded well to chelator therapy in a short period. Conclusion. This case clearly showed the value of peripheral blood smear review and its impact on patient care. In order not to lose the cases, laboratories are recommended to design their own policy for peripheral blood smear review. The peripheral blood smear is the fastest, simplest, and most available screening test, which can prevent many misdiagnoses and malpractices. It provides rich morphological information, among which basophilic stippling is highly suggestive of lead poisoning.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】A manual blood smear review is defined as the thorough and careful microscopic analysis of a well-prepared and stained smear of peripheral blood, with the objective of seeking morphological changes relevant to the diagnosis and monitoring of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Laboratory-initiated examinations of blood smears for patients with anemia are usually the result of a laboratory policy, according to which a blood smear is ordered whenever the hemoglobin concentration is unexpectedly low. In these cases, despite the wealth of the captured information from modern automated cell counters, including red cell count, mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and red cell distribution width (RDW), there are still morphologic abnormalities that are critical in the differential diagnosis of anemia and can be determined only from a blood smear. The detection of variations in the cell shape and red cell inclusions, such as Howell–Jolly bodies, Pappenheimer bodies, and basophilic stippling or punctate basophilia, is highly important. The latter can be suggestive of lead poisoning according to the clinical data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 40-year-old man was transferred to our center at Abu Ali Sina Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, to be evaluated for severe bone pain and abdominal pain for a month, which was worsened one week ago. It was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and constipation. The patient was also complaining of severe weight loss (15 kg during a month). His past medical history was not significant, and he was not taking any medication. He was a fast-food worker with a history of excessive alcohol intake over three years, with no periods of abstinence. He was drinking 1-2 liters of homemade alcohol (using a traditional container for distillation) daily until few days prior to admission. Additionally, he reported a history of on and off synthetic marijuana abuse until three days prior to admission. The bone pain was mostly limited to the lower extremities, and the abdominal pain was severe with a colicky pattern and radiation to both scrotums. Physical examination was significant for high blood pressure (180/100 mmHg), tachycardia (108/min), low-grade fever (37.9°C), and pallor with abdominal and scrotal tenderness. There was no gingival hyperpigmentation, and all deep tendon reflexes were unremarkable.\n\n【6】Laboratory investigations at presentation showed moderate microcytic and hemolytic anemia in addition to significantly elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Abdominopelvic sonography and CT scan showed biliary sludge and small liver hemangioma, respectively. Other laboratory and imaging investigations (color Doppler sonography of the mesenteric artery and vein, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and colonoscopy) were unremarkable. He underwent cholecystectomy with the impression of acute cholecystitis, and the microscopic pathologic diagnosis was just chronic cholecystitis without cholelithiasis. Due to the presence of unexplained anemia and severe bone pain, a bone marrow study was done for him to rule out leukemia, which was in favor of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with 10% ring sideroblasts . The cytogenetic study was normal. Complete blood count (CBC) test with peripheral blood smear (PBS) checking (according to our policy in the hematology laboratory) was done for the patient several times at presentation and during hospitalization. Peripheral blood film examinations, stained by the Wright–Giemsa method, revealed mild to moderate anemia, microcytic hypochromic red blood cells with anisocytosis, polychromasia, and also frequent coarse basophilic stippling of the red cells ; the last one was missed at the first PBS review. Regarding the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow report, the possibility of lead poisoning was considered, and surprisingly, the blood lead level (measured on K2EDTA-whole blood by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) was markedly raised (151 µg/dL; reference range was 10 µg/dL). Since there was no occupational exposure, the traditional distillation dish (made of copper and lead) was traced as the possible source of lead.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bone marrow smear showing that about 10% of erythroid precursors are ring sideroblasts (arrow) (Perl’s Prussian blue stain, ×1000).</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a, b) Peripheral blood smear with basophilic stippling of red blood cells  (Wright–Giemsa, ×1000).</u>\n\n【9】The patient stopped drinking alcohol and marijuana abuse. Chelating therapy with succimer was initiated with a dose of 500 mg (5 capsules) daily, and after four weeks, the blood lead level declined to 25 µg/dl, and he had a weight gain of 6 kg. All signs and symptoms were removed, and all laboratory findings changed to normal condition. Additionally, no clinical or laboratory deficits were noted during the 6-month follow-up visits. Informed consent was requested and obtained from the patient for publishing the case report and the accompanying images. Although some reports are supporting the correlation between hypertension and lead poisoning, in our case, marijuana withdrawal could also be the cause of sympathetic overactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

Discussion\n\n【12】CBC is the most commonly ordered test in hospitalized patients. Modern automated blood cell counters produce a detailed report on the red cells, white cells, and platelets, with differential white blood cell counts. A drop of the remaining blood could then be smeared and stained 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Microscopic examination of this smear under the expert eye yields useful information and further details regarding all formed elements of blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. “More information can be gained from examining the blood smear than any other single hematologic procedure,” Jandl in 1987 said 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This shows the value of PBS review in medical management. Initiation of a PBS review depends on the laboratory policy.

Case Report\n\n【6】A 44-year-old previously healthy male patient has presented with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea for 20 days. He was examined by a pulmonologist in the outpatients’ clinic who requested a chest radiography which was unremarkable. The patient’s symptoms were treated. Five days later, dyspnea and thoracic pain were worse and the patient returned to the pulmonologist who auscultated pericardial friction rub. The patient was refereed to hospital with the initial blood tests showing leukocytosis ( 1 9 . 4 × 1 0 9 /L) and an increase in the C-reactive protein 117.0 mg/L (reference value < 10.0 mg/L). Two blood cultures identified Oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed moderate pericardial effusion with mobile mass adhered on the right atrium. Treatment with Oxacillin was started improving fever and white blood cell count.\n\n【7】The thyroid-stimulating hormone and free-thyroxine levels were normal. Tests for hepatitis B and C and HIV were negative. The screening for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear factor, and anti-DNA was nonreactant. The Mantoux test was negative. Thoracic computed tomography did not show intrathoracic masses or thoracic or hilar adenomegaly.\n\n【8】After 10 days of antibiotic therapy, new echocardiography showed large loculated pericardial effusion with signs of diastolic restriction  and a 4 . 0 × 0 . 5  cm echogenic coronary sinus mass on the right atrium . There were no alterations of cardiac valves, and left ventricular ejection fraction was normal (LVEF 73%).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Transthoracic echocardiography: short axis view showing large pericardial effusion with septations (PE: Pericardial effusion; SP: septations; LV: left ventricle; RV: right ventricle). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Transthoracic echocardiography: apical four-chamber view showing large pericardial effusion and mass in the right atrium at the coronary sinus (RA: right atrium; LV: left ventricle; RV: right ventricle; CS: coronary sinus; PE: Pericardial effusion; M: mass). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】Due to persistent dyspnea and lack of echocardiographic improvement the patient underwent cardiac surgery by median sternotomy draining a large quantity of purulent pericardial effusion.

Discussion\n\n【15】Coronary sinus thrombosis is rare. Lesions associated with coronary sinus catheterization for retrograde cardioplegia during heart surgery with a cardiopulmonary bypass have been described in 0.095% of cases and are normally related to endothelial injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In procedures with access to the right atrium (including hemodynamic studies of the right heart chambers, central venous access, pacemakers, and cardiac resynchronization) which is necessary, the coronary sinus is more susceptible to accidental injury and subsequent thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Infectious processes of the coronary sinus are even rarer. In 1976, Dryer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> described the case of a young patient with a history of drug abuse who went to hospital with septic shock caused by mitral valve bacterial endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The necroscopic exam showed thrombophlebitis of the coronary sinus. Ross et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> described the case of a patient with occlusion of the coronary ostia of the four large epicardial vessels and of the coronary sinus caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and also found postmortem. Another case describes diagnosis and treatment of septic thrombophlebitis in a patient who had previously underwent heart surgery (which may explain an injury in the coronary sinus because of a central venous access orundergoingcatheterization of the pulmonary artery).Clinically, the patient had repeated furuncles, probably because of bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Pericardium spontaneous bacterial infection is also uncommon due to its association with endocarditis because there is no relationship between pericardium venous drainage and the coronary system. Bacterial pericarditis normally occurs due to trauma, including thoracic surgery, pericardial, drainage, and propagation of an intrathoracic, myocardial, or subdiaphragmatic focus or hematogenic dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The mortality rate of patients with bacterial pericarditis is high. It may be as high as 40% of patients diagnosed and treated, and it may be up to 85% of nontreated patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】What makes our case unusual is the fact that the patient, who had been healthy until that time, was under a clinical condition of acute pericarditis, severe pericardial effusion, and coronary sinus mass with intraoperative macroscopic vegetative aspect on the right atrium. However, the patient did not have cardiac valve compromise suggesting endocarditis. The patient had not been submitted to any previous procedures that could have led to trauma of the coronary sinus, predisposition to pericarditis or bacterial endocarditis. There were no signs of immunosuppression similar to those found in patients with neoplasias, autoimmune diseases, diseases of the conjunctive tissue, and infectious diseases like HIV.\n\n【19】Nevertheless, it is not possible to determine if the endocarditis of the coronary sinus allows hematogenic dissemination to the pericardium or vice versa.\n\n【20】This case represents the only description of a vegetative growth in the coronary sinus associated with spontaneous bacterial pericarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus without cardiac valve infection, underwent pericardial drainage, removal of the vegetation from the coronary sinus, and antibiotic treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:12:35", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:13:11", "cost": 35.79}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:13:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:12:34"}

Signs and symptoms depend on the tumor location and size. The intrapericardial lipoma we report has massive dimensions and mimics a pericardial effusion. A 38-year-old male complained of dyspnea and precordial pain. On physical examination, heart sounds were diminished. The patient had received extensive medication for a clinically suspected pericardial effusion due to heart failure. A voluminous mass resembling fat within the pericardial sac was revealed by transesophageal echocardiography and a computed tomography scan. The tumor was removed successfully by a subxiphoid surgical approach. The diagnosis of a 635 gram intrapericardial lipoma was confirmed by pathological examination. After surgery, the patient recovered well and was completely asymptomatic at a follow-up at 90 days. No medications were being taken since. The diagnosis of a pericardial effusion should be secured by imaging exams to avoid unnecessary medications. Cardiac lipomas can be readily recognized by their typical features on radiologic imaging. The surgical pathology examination confirms the diagnosis and rules out malignancy criteria.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primary heart neoplasms are rare diseases, and their incidence rate is up to 0.4% in necropsy series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Approximately 75% of these lesions are benign tumors, such as myxomas, rhabdomyomas, lipomas, fibromas, and teratomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. Lipomas represent approximately 10% of all primary cardiac tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–9\\]</u>. Additionally, about 25% of cardiac lipomas are intramyocardial, 25% are extracavitary with an epicardial origin, and 50% are intracavitary with a subendocardial origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 10, 11\\]</u>. They usually appear on the walls of the right atrium or left ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8, 11, 12\\]</u>. Typically, lipomas are found in adults by the fifth and sixth decades of life. However, they can occur at any age. Cardiac lipoma frequency is about equal in both genders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 11, 13–15\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Signs and symptoms vary according to the size and localization of the tumor. Cardiac lipomas can cause thoracic pain, fatigue, dyspnea, syncope, arrhythmias, or even sudden death. Nevertheless, most cases are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5, 8, 11, 16, 17\\]</u>. Imaging exams are essential for guiding the diagnosis, such as echocardiography, tomography, or magnetic resonance. To exclude a malignant neoplastic process, the surgical pathology examination is necessary. Encapsulated lesions constituted of typical and mature adipocytes favor a benign neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 11\\]</u>. In this article, we report the case of a young male patient with a large intrapericardial lipoma compressing the heart and mimicking a pericardial effusion.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 38-year-old male has complained of progressive dyspnea and sporadic precordial pain related to moderate effort for 5 months. Physical examination showed normal peripheral perfusion, and no edema was detected. On auscultation, no murmurs were heard; however, heart sounds were diminished. Clinically, a pericardial effusion due to heart failure was suspected and treated with pharmacologic drugs. The patient received digoxin, aspirin, furosemide, spironolactone, and carvedilol for 8 weeks until imaging exams were performed.\n\n【7】Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 79% ventricular ejection fraction and a hypoechoic mass within the pericardium attached to the free wall of the right ventricle and atria. A computed tomography scan showed an expansive mass in the anterior region of the pericardium with a homogeneously low density similar to fat. The tumor had a regular shape and measured 14.0 × 10.0 × 16.0 cm. The cardiac lesion extended from the upper to the lower thoracic region, displaced the heart backward, and reduced the right cardiac chambers .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Voluminous pericardial mass. Pericardium tumor with a density similar to fat on a computed tomography scan. Note that the tumor causes posterior displacement of the heart and signs of a reduction in the dimensions of the right heart chambers.</u>\n\n【9】The patient was submitted to a pericardial window via a subxiphoid surgical approach, in which a pedunculated epicardial tumor inserted in the right ventricle was resected. No cardiopulmonary bypass was needed. At gross examination, the tumor was split into two irregular fatty fragments measuring 22.5 × 9.0 × 4.0 cm and 21.0 × 15.0 × 2.0 cm and weighing 635 grams . The histological exam revealed an encapsulated neoplasm formed by mature adipocytes . No lipoblasts, cellular atypia, or mitosis were seen, and the diagnosis of lipoma was stated.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Voluminous intrapericardial lipoma. (a) Gross examination—fatty lobulated massive tumor covered by a fine fibrous capsule. (b) Microscopy—delicate fibrous capsule delineates the mass. (c) Mature adipocytes form the tumor. No atypia is observed.</u>\n\n【11】Ten days after surgery, the patient was discharged from the hospital without any medications. At a follow-up at 90 days, the patient was completely asymptomatic.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Most cardiac lipomas are asymptomatic. Therefore, the diagnosis of these benign neoplasms is frequently done on autopsies. Medical literature may underestimate their real prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Generally, they remain indolent for many years since clinical symptoms depend on the growth speed, position, and tumor size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The majority of cardiac lipomas is sessile or polypoid masses implanted in the subendocardium or epicardium. Only 25% of cardiac lipomas arise within the myocardium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 20\\]</u>. Often, lipomas arise from the epicardial fat and grow into the pericardial sac 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, there are case reports of distinct sites, such as the right atrium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, left atrium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>, tricuspid valve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>, mitral valve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>, right ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>, left ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 27\\]</u>, interventricular septum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 28\\]</u>, and inside the ventricular cavities themselves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Size ranges from 1 to 15 cm in diameter, and weight such as 2 kg is described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Symptoms occur when the mass compresses the cardiac chambers and causes hemodynamic changes. Sometimes, it may cause pericardial effusions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Intrapericardial lipomas can cause dyspnea by reducing the pulmonary volume or by elevating the ventricular filling pressures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Fatigue and thoracic pain, possibly by coronary artery compression, are less common clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 17\\]</u>. Intracavitary lipomas can lead to heart failure, syncope, and sudden death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Intramyocardial lipomas may result in conduction system disorders and arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 32–35\\]</u>. Our patient presented thoracic pain and dyspnea due to a voluminous intrapericardial lipomatous tumor compressing the cardiac chambers.\n\n【16】Chest radiography, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram, tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging play an important role in identifying the lipoma location and relationship to the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 36–38\\]</u>. On chest radiography, cardiac lipomas may mimic hilar neoplasia, diaphragmatic herniation, or mediastinal mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. An echocardiogram can usually define the position and size of the lipoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging establish the fatty differentiation of the tumor, define precisely its insertion and relationship to the cardiac structures, and give additional information to rule out malignant neoplasms, such as liposarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8, 11, 39\\]</u>. Coronary angiography can be useful in cases of coronary compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Imaging exams are important to evaluate the biological behavior of heart tumors. However, malignancy and the definitive diagnosis can be made by histopathological examination only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. On gross examination, lipomas are bright yellow fatty nodules with a delicate capsule. The cut surface is greasy with fine fibrous trabeculae. Under the microscope, lipomas are constituted by mature adipose tissue. There may be areas of steatonecrosis and calcification. Ruling out well-differentiated liposarcomas can be problematic in some cases. The latter contains a few lipoblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In our case, the histological exam excluded malignant criteria.\n\n【18】Although lipomas are benign and slow-growing tumors, the surgical approach is to prevent heart compression and hemodynamic changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 11\\]</u>. Surgery has satisfactory results and low mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 11, 40\\]</u>. The complete removal of the tumor pedicle is crucial to avoid relapses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 11, 16, 26, 41\\]</u>. Surgery scheduling depends upon many factors, especially on the tumor size and location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42, 43\\]</u>. Our patient underwent an elective surgery with no complications nor relapses at his follow-up.\n\n【19】Pericardial lipomas’ signs and symptoms are variable. Indeed, most of the patients are asymptomatic. Conversely, surgical removal is necessary to prevent cardiac compression and to exclude malignancy through the histopathological examination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:00:47", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:02:01", "cost": 73.522}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:02:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:00:47"}

One of the features of AVC involves compression of the left innominate vein with variability in luminal caliber on inspiration and expiration. Imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) examination can aid in initial diagnosis; however, venography can be utilized for confirmatory diagnosis due to its higher specificity during the inspiratory and expiratory phases. Through findings demonstrated during venography, we herein present two cases of confirmed AVC secondary to an aberrant right subclavian artery. Characteristic imaging features in the diagnosis of AVC and its etiology are discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Aortosternal venous compression (AVC) was first described by Wurtz et al. in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a rare venous compression syndrome that is commonly asymptomatic in otherwise healthy patients due to compensation by collateral vasculature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Scarcely reported symptoms in the literature include left upper extremity edema and intermittent instances of pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Although mediastinal masses can result in external compression of the underlying vasculature within the anterior or superior mediastinum, AVC is a diagnosis of exclusion. It can be caused by tortuous and/or ectatic great vessels resulting in associated compression on the underlying brachiocephalic vein in the setting of a diminished anterior-posterior chest diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 5\\]</u>. Three instances of an aberrant right subclavian artery have been reported in the literature as the causative agent of AVC; however, the prevalence of this etiology has yet to be established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We present two cases of AVC, in the setting of anatomical variation of aberrant right subclavian artery, wherein chest computed tomography (CT) and venography were utilized in establishing this rare diagnosis and its etiology.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 72-year-old female presented with ongoing paresthesia and “pulsations” of the right neck and scalp. Her medical history includes an asymptomatic congenital coronary to pulmonary artery fistula that was monitored without any surgical intervention. The patient denied any loss of consciousness, tinnitus, or slurred speech. Physical examination demonstrated a lack of neck or facial swelling, lack of skin discoloration, and absence of dysphagia. A focused upper extremity exam revealed intact sensations, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, normal muscle tone and motor strength 5/5, in addition to a steady gait. Laboratory investigations showed an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.0 and an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 29. Complete blood count (CBC), Vitamin B12, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were all within normal limits.\n\n【8】Due to the ongoing paresthesia, a contrast-enhanced CT head and neck was ordered. Initial imaging revealed an aberrant right subclavian artery with a course dorsal to the esophagus and an anteroposterior (AP) chest diameter of 6.4 cm . An ultrasound of the neck was ordered as part of the workup  which demonstrated no thrombus within either internal jugular vein (IJV) but did show the diffuse slow flow of the left IJV, with the near stagnant flow in the proximal left IJV. Findings were nonspecific; however, the layered appearance could be seen in the setting of underlying proximal compression/obstruction.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Axial contrast-enhanced CT images (CTA neck) demonstrate the anatomical variation of an aberrant right subclavian artery (yellow arrow) with its course posterior to the esophagus, resulting in an impression along the dorsal aspect of the esophagus.

Anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 8 cm on inspiratory phase. (b) Axial contrast-enhanced CT images (CTA neck): retrospective analysis demonstrates an anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 6.4 cm in the expiratory phase.

This layered appearance could be seen in the setting of underlying proximal compression/obstruction. Right IJV (A) was observed to be patent with the nonsluggish flow.</u>\n\n【11】The initial CT neck did not include the entire mediastinum within the field of view and thus additional imaging with a chest CT was ordered to rule out mediastinal mass as an etiology of proximal compression. The subsequent imaging did not reveal a mediastinal mass or aortic arch aneurysm, however, did demonstrate a left-sided aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery without a diverticulum of Kommerell. However, as the CT chest examination was performed during the expiratory phase, findings of brachiocephalic venous compression were noted. A comparison was made to the prior CT angiography (CTA) neck, with interval difference in the brachiocephalic venous caliber. Thus, an inspiratory phase of the chest CT was also performed in the same setting to further evaluate the change in luminal caliber of the brachiocephalic vein. Findings of the chest CT (with inspiration and expiration) revealed the left brachiocephalic vein to become severely stenotic on expiration with an AP chest diameter of 5.6 cm. Comparatively, during inspiration, the chest CT revelated a patent left brachiocephalic vein with an AP chest diameter of 8 cm . Findings were suspicious for AVC, and thus venography was ordered. The venogram was obtained through a left upper extremity venous catheter during both expiration and inspiration. The venogram demonstrated severe stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein during expiration with multiple venous collaterals around the site of obstruction . The venogram during inspiration demonstrated prompt flow of contrast across the left brachiocephalic vein with no evidence of obstruction. Previous exclusion of other aforementioned etiologies of venous compression, and the venographic findings mentioned above, led to a diagnosis of AVC in the setting of anatomical variation of an aberrant right subclavian artery.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 (a) Axial noncontrast CT obtained in full inspiration demonstrates patent left brachiocephalic vein (purple arrow).

The patient opted out of having any surgical intervention. The patient has since been lost to follow-up.\n\n【15】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【16】A 34-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of dysphagia and headaches accompanied by left orbital pain with visualization of occasional “squiggly lines” in the left eye. Additionally, she complained of a warm sensation overlying the left forehead and ipsilateral ear. She denied any pulsatile tinnitus, facial droop, or paresthesia. The medical history of the patient included tonsillectomy, with a family history of intracranial aneurysms, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, colorectal cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【17】On physical examination, she was alert and oriented to person, time, and place. No cranial or carotid bruits were observed. Normal ocular vision with no pathological nystagmus, proptosis, or diplopia was noted. The facial sensation was intact, and the muscles of facial expression were normal and symmetric. Motor examination revealed normal bulk, tone, power, and coordination in all 4 limbs with no pathological reflexes. The sensation was grossly normal. Romberg's testing was negative. Physical examination demonstrated a prominent left frontal superficial scallop vein that became prominent when a patient was placed in a left lateral decubitus position. The left frontal superficial scallop vein did not demonstrate prominence during spine flexion, right lateral decubitus, or upright positioning.\n\n【18】Due to the ongoing headaches and the prominent left frontal superficial vein, investigation with MRI of the brain and MR angiography (MRA) was performed. Findings of the MRA demonstrated no evidence of dural arteriovenous fistula, vascular thrombosis, arteriovenous (AV) shunting, or vascular malformation.\n\n【19】Further investigation with a CTA chest (inspiratory phase) was conducted to rule out a mediastinal mass resulting in venous compression. CTA chest demonstrated no evidence of a mediastinal mass; however, incidentally, an aberrant right subclavian artery was noted . Furthermore, there was mild compression of the brachiocephalic vein during this initial inspiratory phase, which warranted further investigation to rule out aortosternal venous compression . CTA in an expiratory phase was subsequently performed, demonstrating findings of severe stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein . Thus, a venogram was ordered as part of the workup in order to confirm the diagnosis of AVC. Findings of the venogram demonstrated a patent left subclavian and superior vena cava (SVC) with no significant stenosis with respect to the left brachiocephalic vein in the inspiratory phase . The subsequent expiratory phase  demonstrated severe stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein, with cephalad reflux of contrast in the left IJV. Additionally, collateral supply arising from the left IJV and communicating with the right brachiocephalic vein was observed during the expiratory phase. The above findings were utilized to confirm the diagnosis of AVC with a component of cranial venous congestion.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 (a) Axial contrast-enhanced CT images (CTA neck) demonstrate the anatomical variation of an aberrant right subclavian artery (yellow arrow) with its course posterior to the esophagus.

Based on the last follow-up visit the patient is doing well with decreased severity of symptoms.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】##### 3.1. Symptoms and Presentation\n\n【26】Extrinsic venous compression can be observed in the setting of mediastinal mass compression given the rather confined anatomic space within the superior and anterior mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. AVC, characteristically regarded as brachiocephalic vein compression, is a rare form of extrinsic venous compression, first reported in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Tortuous and/or ectatic great vessels can act as another factor resulting in extrinsic compression of the brachiocephalic vein, particularly in patients with a diminished anteroposterior chest diameter. An aberrant right subclavian artery has also been associated with AVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. The prevalence of AVC has not been well characterized due to its rarity. A study in hemodialysis patients undergoing fistulograms identified some degree of extrinsic compression of the brachiocephalic vein in 44% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【27】AVC is often asymptomatic, due to adequate compensation by collateral vasculature; however, cases in the literature have described instances of pain and swelling in the supraclavicular region and left upper extremity, as well as morning headaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>. One case reported symptoms of paresthesia, thus, a similar symptomatic presentation to the first case presented in this case series. Even though rare, symptoms of paresthesia combined with pulsation, can lead the referring clinician to consider AVC as part of the differential workup 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Furthermore, the presence of an anatomical variant such as an aberrant right subclavian artery resulting in esophageal compression due to its dorsal course can result in dysphagia lusoria, which potentially accounts for the dysphagia observed in the second case presented above 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the atypical presentation of AVC and the variable etiology of this syndrome highlight the necessity of combining imaging modalities in confirming a diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【28】##### 3.2. Imaging Features\n\n【29】Few imaging modalities are employed in the diagnosis of venous compression syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Contrast-enhanced chest CT and diagnostic venography are imaging modalities that can be utilized to diagnose AVC. Initial imaging with ultrasound may demonstrate sluggish flow and/or intraluminal thrombus in the left subclavian, brachiocephalic, or left IJV, however, these findings are nonspecific as they primarily relate to proximal stenosis or obstruction, and thus further investigation into AVC or brachiocephalic vein compression is warranted with cross-sectional imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Based on a retrospective review of the literature, the importance of cross-sectional imaging for the evaluation of anatomical variation and in establishing the etiology of venous compression has been established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8, 9\\]</u>. Therefore, in the appropriate clinical setting, chest CT (with inspiratory and expiratory phase) can be utilized as the initial imaging modality to exclude an extrinsic venous compression etiology such as a mediastinal mass, aortic aneurysmal dilation, or compression secondary to the aortic arch anomaly. Even though the rare association of AVC with the aberrant right subclavian artery is noted in the literature, such a finding can be visualized on contrast-enhanced CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Once the brachiocephalic vein compression is suspected on CT, the next step of performing a diagnostic venogram can aid in real-time fluoroscopic evaluation, again in the setting of the inspiratory and expiratory phase, with the latter demonstrating venous compression. Secondary findings on the venogram, demonstrated by underlying collateral vascularity establish the chronicity of the diagnosis. The venogram can be performed via cannulating the basilic, cephalic or brachial veins, followed by advancing an angled catheter and a 0.035 Glidewire to access the distal left subclavian or axillary vein (proximal to the region of the stenosis). Alternatively, the catheter can also be advanced into the ipsilateral jugular vein. The angled catheter can be exchanged for a multipurpose side-hole catheter, through which a contrast injection can be performed in the inspiratory and expiratory phases. The patency within the left subclavian vein, LIJ, and left brachiocephalic vein during inspiration excludes an underlying acute or chronic thrombus as an etiology, thus highlighting the importance of a biphasic exam 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Therefore, the ability to visualize flow dynamics in venography can aid in establishing a firm AVC diagnosis, and thus venography could potentially be established as a gold standard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Moreover, during cross-sectional imaging, the AP diameter (dorsal aspect of the manubrium to the ventral aspect of the vertebral body) can be measured, at the level of the brachiocephalic vein in both inspiratory and expiratory phases of the examination. Upon expiration, the AP diameter diminishes, with a confined mediastinal anatomic space. Even though there are no established AP diameter parameters, a significant decrease in expiratory phase diameter should prompt further investigation into AVC or brachiocephalic vein compression. Furthermore, aberrant right subclavian arteries, which are the most common embryologic abnormality of the aortic arch, result as an additive feature to the already confined anatomic space in the mediastinum which further predisposes patients to brachiocephalic vein compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 12\\]</u>. Therefore, upon findings of an aberrant right subclavian artery with the appropriate abovementioned clinical symptoms, the patient could be assessed for AVC as a potential etiology once other differentials have been excluded. Nevertheless, standard variations in AP diameters on inspiration versus expiration, and the incidence of aberrant right subclavian arteries as the cause of AVC have yet to be established, drawing attention to the need for future studies on this topic.\n\n【31】#### 4\\. Treatment and Discussion\n\n【32】Conservative management remains the mainstay in AVC and includes arm elevation at night as well as avoidance of the left lateral decubitus position to reduce pressure on the brachiocephalic vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In our institution, conservative management has proven to be sufficient in managing the symptoms and complaints of AVC. However, surgical management may be required for symptomatic cases of compression in the setting of conservative management failure. Yet, surgery is an invasive option that carries risks and thus is not recommended as a first-line approach. Therefore, conservative management is the advisable treatment option in symptomatic venous compression patients as a first-line approach. In patients who fail conservative management, angioplasty and self-expanding stents are treatment methods of choice in common venous compression syndromes such as Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS), nutcracker syndrome, and May–Thurner syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. A literature review also demonstrated that self-expanding stents can successfully treat symptomatic stenosis of the brachiocephalic vein, particularly in hemodialysis patients where dialysis access may be threatened 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, due to the extrinsic nature of compression, stents are not recommended in AVC patients due to limited patency and allowable volume changes of the vascular space during respiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 14\\]</u>. In the setting of the patient not being a surgical candidate and failing conservative management, the stenosis could potentially be treated with self-expandable stents. Notably, balloon expandable stents should also be avoided in AVC management as they can be crushed and can migrate secondary to external compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In severe cases of venous compression syndromes, operative decompression of the thoracic inlet including manubrioplasty has been employed as a radical approach to address the underlying anatomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the long-term prognosis is unknown due to limited cases in the literature.\n\n【33】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【34】AVC is a rare extrinsic venous compression syndrome.

However, most esophageal lymphangiomas that are larger than 2 cm in diameter reported in the literature can be removed only through open surgery. Thus far, we know of no reported cases of endoscopic resection as a treatment for this case.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Lymphangioma of the esophagus is a benign cystic tumor, which is characterized by the presence of chylous or serous fluid within an irregularly dilated lymphatic channel. To date, it has been a rare clinical entity. Most esophageal lymphangiomas reported in the literature are smaller than 2 cm in diameter and can be removed using endoscopy. The present report describes a patient with lymphangioma of the esophagus. Endoscopy after admission revealed a 60 × 10 mm mass in the esophagus, which was then treated by endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection (EPMR).\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 41-year-old man was admitted to the neighborhood hospital because of dysphagia when eating for the past three months. The gastroscopy showed a submucosal mass in the distal esophagus. He was then transferred to our hospital on August 4, 2011, for further examination and treatment. The personal medical and family histories were unremarkable. There was no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, or weight loss, and the physical examination and standard laboratory tests were within normal limits.\n\n【6】The endoscopy after admission revealed a large, whitish-yellow, translucent mass with a lustrous surface in the mid and distal esophagus located 32 to 38 cm from the incisors . The mucosa was normal in appearance upon visualization. A later endoscopic biopsy specimen showed mild to moderate dysplasia of the lesion mucosa. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) demonstrated that there was a honeycomb-like hypoechoic structure measuring 60 × 10 mm located in the submucosa with a heterogeneous echo pattern and revealed that the muscularis propria was intact .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Endoscopic finding.

The esophageal mass was resected by EPMR on August 5, 2011. We used a needle and inserted it into the tumor body for suction, but there was no outflow of liquid. Then, the esophageal mass was removed using snare electrocautery after injecting the base of the mass with a mixed solution of saline and indigo carmine. The specimen was a cellular-like cystic structure, composed of jelly-like material. The superficial layers of the esophageal wall were clean and contained no significant bleeding . The postendoscopic resection course was uneventful, and the patient was well 8 months after the endoscopic resection. Histology of the resected specimen showed cystically dilated lymphatics in the surface squamous epithelium and the submucosa, focally in the muscularis propria with lymphoid fluid in the lumen, and lymphoid aggregates in the stroma between the vessel walls, consistent with lymphangioma . No cysts or stromal tumors were identified. Gastroscopy after eight months showed the original excision wound formed a scar, and rebiopsy confirmed no lesion recurrence. Currently, the patient is still in follow-up.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Lymphangiomas are benign cystic tumors. They are characterized by the presence of chylous or serous fluid within an irregularly dilated lymphatic channel. Lymphangiomas may appear in any organ except the brain, although they commonly develop in the head and neck region, and only 1% are found in the GI tract. Of those that arise in the gut, the majority are found in the colon, followed in order of frequency by the stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The etiology of these tumors is not completely understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. They are thought to be a malformation or sequestration of lymphatic tissue that fails to communicate normally with the lymphatic system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Lymphangioma of the esophagus is a rare clinical entity. It was first reported by Watson-Williams in 1934 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, and Brady and Milligan were the first persons to diagnose it by endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Only 16 cases have been reported in the literature to date. The most common presenting symptoms are dysphagia, heartburn, postprandial vomiting, and epigastric pain. It can also present without any symptoms. Endoscopic Ultrasonography is the most important means of diagnosing. Submucosal tumors with multicystic echo pattern within the third layer or submucosa are considered characteristic of lymphangioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There are generally no difficulties in regard to the pathological diagnosis. Esophageal lymphangioma patients have a good prognosis. Asymptomatic patients do not necessarily need to have the tumor removed, but intervention should be considered when difficulty in swallowing develops or when a mass is suspected to be malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Common treatments include surgical resection, endoscopic resection, and carbon dioxide laser treatment. It was reported that treatment with a subcutaneous injection of interferon-2a resulted in a slight improvement in the dysphagia. Although it has side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>, the tumor size decreased, and good results were achieved because of its antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effect.\n\n【11】No cases of malignant transformation have been described because lymphangioma is a benign tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and gastrointestinal lymphangioma of malignant transformation has rarely been reported. Endoscopic resection was applied to the lesions involving the muscularis mucosa and submucosa. However, when the tumor involves the muscularis propria or if a malignant lesion is suspected, thoracic surgery should be performed. For the patient in the present study, preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated that the tumor was located in the submucosa, and endoscopic resection achieved good results. Thus, the choice of endoscopic ultrasound has an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal lymphangioma.\n\n【12】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【13】Our treatment has demonstrated that it is feasible and safe to enucleate lymphangioma even for large lesions. To the best of our knowledge, the endoscopic resection has the advantages of a short operation time, fewer injuries, and a rapid recovery. We believe that EPMR is a safe and sufficient method of therapy for esophageal lymphangioma lesions less than 5 cm in diameter and those located in the mucosa and submucosa.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:53:39", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:04", "cost": 24.695}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:53:39"}

Case Report\n\n【6】A 37-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology with the chief complain of swelling on the right buccal mucosa from last one year. On clinical examination a well circumscribed red to purple lesion in color approximating 2 × 2 cm on the right buccal mucosa was noted . The swelling was firm in consistency and nontender on palpation. The mucosa overlying the swelling was normal in color with absence of any ulceration. There was no history of chronic cheek biting and irritation was reported. Association of any extra oral swelling was not evident. On the basis of clinical features provisional diagnosis of mucocele was made. Aspiration was performed by 25-gauge needle under topical anesthesia . A collection of frank blood was obtained which was subjected to cytological examination. Cytological examination ruled out the possibility of mucocele. Ultrasound reports confirmed that the lesion was not associated with any feeder vessel which is the characteristic feature of hemangioma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Purple lesion of buccal mucosa. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Aspiration consists of blood. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】After the correlation of clinical, cytological, and ultrasound finding, treatment was planned for surgical excision under local anesthesia .

Such lesions represent a variety of clinical entities, ranging from physiologic changes to manifestation of systemic illness and malignant neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Hemangioma and mucocele are commonly encountered in oral cavity as pigmented swelling with the color ranging from red to purple. However clinical tests such as diascopy and laboratory investigations such as blood test are useful to reach the definitive diagnosis of hemangioma; on the other hand mucocele is usually associated with a traumatic injury and commonly occurs on the lower lip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Angiofibromas are rare benign mesenchymal tumor characterized clinically by red to purplish swelling and microscopically by bland spindle shaped cells arranged without any pattern in a stroma with wispy collagen and numerous small and medium-sized thick-walled vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The present case also exhibited a purple swelling clinically resembling hemangioma or mucocele as the ultrasound reports did not show any feeder vessel so the hemangioma was excluded and aspiration cytology did not yield the mucin so mucocele could also be excluded from the final diagnosis. The microscopic differential diagnosis for CAF includes angiomyolipoma, angiomyofibroblastoma, juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, solitary fibrous tumor, and spindle cell lipoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> .\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Differential diagnosis of angiofibroma and specific features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.</u>\n\n【20】Besides the different location, typical clinical characteristics of extranasopharyngeal angiofibromas, such as, symptoms, age, and sex, do not conform to a great extent with that of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. This fact has led to doubt as to whether extranasopharyngeal angiofibromas, though structurally similar, should be considered as being different from nasopharyngeal angiofibroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Angiofibromas are histologically composed of a proliferating vascular component set in a fibrous stroma. The former is characterized by blood vessels of different size and smooth muscle content.

Although pregnancy-associated pyogenic sacroiliitis rarely occurs, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A timely diagnosis of the disease is challenging due to its nonspecific clinical symptoms. We reviewed a case that experienced an acute illness during pregnancy. The illness was manifested by localized pain in the hips or buttocks, sacroiliac joint tenderness, and debilitating hip pain during ambulation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed little joint involvement, and the patient was treated with antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and glucocorticoids. The patient responded well to the therapy with marked improvement in her ambulation. Septic sacroiliitis should be considered in peripartum patients presenting with increased inflammatory markers and severe localized pain. Medical management is usually curative and without an adverse effect on pregnancy. Although we could not perform a biopsy to verify the cause of the disease, the patient’s excellent response to the treatment confirmed our diagnosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hip and low back pain (LBP) frequently occur during pregnancy with a prevalence ranging from 30% to 78% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Pain may originate from the lumbar region, hip, or sacroiliac joint (SIJ). LBP or buttocks usually has a nonspecific etiology and a self-limited course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The risk factors for LBP include pelvic trauma, low age, multiparous, chronic LBP, and history of LBP in the previous pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】However, certain conditions complicate the diagnosis, such as transient hip osteoporosis, hip avascular necrosis, sacral stress fracture, and sacroiliitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The sacroiliac joint disease usually presents with LBP that increases with ambulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although most cases represent nonspecific arthritis, the sacroiliac joint can be seeded after bacteremia, resulting in a pyogenic course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】This complication is prevalent in injection drug users, although it may develop after any bacteremia. If the disease develops during pregnancy, it may pose a diagnostic challenge, as pain in the low back and buttocks is common and often nonspecific during pregnancy and the postpartum period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The incidence of pregnancy-associated sacroiliitis is low, with less than 20 cases reported in the literature occurring during pregnancy, during the puerperium, or after an abortion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The pathophysiology of pregnancy-associated sacroiliitis may involve relaxation of pelvic ligaments during pregnancy, resulting in increases in pelvic movements and thus microtrauma to the joint surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Therefore, the physician may be susceptible to any transient bacteremia occurring in the context of pregnancy-induced immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Here, we reported a case of pregnancy-associated inflammatory sacroiliitis, which is rare and often underrecognized in daily clinical practice.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 24-year-old pregnant woman with a gestational age of about 35 weeks herself referred to an orthopedic emergency department. The patient suffered from sharp severe hip joint pain for a week. She was referred to a maternity hospital with a diagnosis of septic arthritis. After admission, the pain developed suddenly and radiated down to her right thigh. The pain was worsening over time. She regularly used local dairy products and did not take any specific medications. She had a successful vaginal delivery previously. A day after hospitalization, the labor pain began, and the vaginal delivery was conducted in the first hours of admission in the labor ward due to spontaneous labor pain. She suffered from pelvic pain and motion limitation of the hip, especially during the second stage of the delivery. The vaginal delivery had no dystocia regardless of the mother’s pelvic pain. The newborn had a normal Apgar score (9/10). She was unable to ambulate postpartum due to excruciating hip pain. She had anorexia, chill and malaise, low-grade fever, and mild respiratory issues. She was hemodynamically stable in a normal range.\n\n【10】Urine and blood were collected and revealed an infective bladder, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), negative rheumatoid factor (RF), negative 2-mercaptoethanol test (2 ME), negative blood culture (B/C), negative HIV, negative viral hepatitis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 通用删除7(英):<u>(135)</u>. A chest X-ray was performed, and it was normal. A hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperlaxity of muscles around the right hip joint without evidence of bone damage. Mild collection of hematoma was noted, and the right sacroiliac joint showed fluid collection measuring 14 × 14 mm. The hips, femoral heads, and acetabulums were intact and showed normal congruency.\n\n【11】Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast revealed normal lumbar spines. A pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and demonstrated an abnormal right sacroiliac joint signal sacroiliac joint (SIJ). SIG enhancement was revealed, which is in favor of arthritis. Empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy was administered to cover urinary tract infection (UTI), which was presumed to be the infection source. She was transferred to the rheumatology department for further treatment. The follow-up with her treating specialist revealed that she had improved significantly and regained her ability to function normally. She was discharged for a further follow-up of 10–20 days. An examination under anesthesia revealed no evidence of a perinatal abscess. On day 6 postpartum, blood cultures and a perinatal wound swab had grown group A Streptococcus (pyogenic); thus, her antibiotic regimen was rationalized to intravenous benzylpenicillin. However, she continued to have a fever and debilitating hip pain during ambulation.\n\n【12】Furthermore, cultures of urine, blood, and perinatal swabs were negative, and a color Doppler ultrasound excluded pelvic deep venous thrombosis. On day 12 postpartum, she underwent a pelvic MRI scan, which revealed bilateral sacroiliitis with a right-sided sacroiliac joint collection . It was subsequently drained under computed tomography (CT) guidance, yielding 1 mL of purulent fluid and dramatically improving the patient’s symptoms. She was discharged home on day 15 on a four-week intravenous benzylpenicillin course, followed by a six-week oral amoxicillin course.\n\n【13】After discharge, she was followed up and her gait and pain reduced day by day, and by the fourth week, her pain completely faded away.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a)-(b) Bilateral sacroiliitis with the right sacroiliac joint collection.</u>\n\n【15】An internal medicine physician observed her for two months after discharge from the hospital and prescribed her nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) (ibuprofen 200 mg three times a day) and pregabalin (75 mg twice a day) for 4 weeks after discharging from the hospital. She showed full recovery and was found to ambulate freely with no sign of discomfort in her sacroiliac joint. The laboratory findings during admission and cure are given in Table 1.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 The diagnosis test and inflammatory markers.</u>\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】The sacroiliac joint is a nonweight-bearing joint with a small range of motion that has to endure extra burden during pregnancy due to biomechanical changes, leading to pubic instability, inflammation, bone edema, and stress fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The latter can quickly occur if there is insufficient bone mass due to osteopenia or vitaminD deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】This case had severe pain, and her CRP was very high, leading us to include pyogenic sacroiliitis in the entry diagnosis. Pyogenic sacroiliitis may be accompanied by a history of intravenous drug abuse, infective endocarditis, urinary tract infection, abortion, or delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 11\\]</u>. However, infections play an important role in this disease. The primary causative organisms are groups A and B Streptococci and Staphylococcus species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is particularly important due to its mortality rate of 20–25%, a consequence of the toxic shock-like syndrome triggered by its exotoxin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. GAS can also cause rapid bone and joint destruction, resulting in chronic disability for survivors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Although the timely diagnosis of pyogenic sacroiliitis is critical, it presents a diagnostic challenge. Moreover, one-third of patients with pyogenic sacroiliitis have a normal white cell count and are afebrile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The most valuable investigations to establish this diagnosis are inflammatory markers, including almost universally elevated ESR and CRP levels, occasionally positive blood and urine cultures, and pelvic MRI. Bone edema, sclerosis, and erosions in SIJ are typical radiological changes similar to those in postpartum sacroiliitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Moreover, our case had a sign of upper tract infection. There were high ESR and CRP in her laboratory findings, which are in line with our diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Empiric antibiotic regimens include vancomycin in combination with a third or fourth-generation cephalosporin (such as ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or cefepime) and metronidazole. An alternative regimen consisting of vancomycin in combination with a 6 carbapenem is useful for coverage of staphylococci, Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. Most patients remit completely in five months, but about 10% of them may experience more chronic persistent arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【21】#### 4\\.

After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed in lateral decubitus and the left arm was placed over a bolster. A midline posterior incision was used to expose the proximal ulna. An osteotomy was performed at the level of the depressed articular surface to mobilize and elevate the depressed fragments in an attempt to realign the articular surfaces of the ulnohumeral joint. Reduction of the malunited intra-articular fragments was not possible because the fracture fragments were sclerotic. Shortening of the olecranon due to axial impaction—which was worsened by the tension-band construct—prohibited good alignment. An iliac-crest bone graft, 6 mm by 15 mm in size, was interposed to widen and reconstruct the trochlear notch. After lengthening of the proximal olecranon, the humerus could be easily reduced to restore ulnohumeral congruency. Stable fixation was achieved with 2 lag screws secured with a 4-hole LCP plate . It was noted that the posterior capsule was contracted. However, at this point it was chosen not to perform a posterior capsular release to preserve the surrounding soft tissues of the olecranon tip to protect vascular blood supply. Postoperatively, the patient was immobilized in a long arm cast and continuous passive motion was initiated 24 hours after surgery and therapy was started.

Simple transverse fractures only benefit from figure-of-eight tension band wiring with predictable outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 8\\]</u>. The goal of this technique is to convert the extensor force of the triceps to a dynamic compression force along the articular surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. This compressive force results in shortening of the trochlear notch if the fracture is comminuted as is illustrated in this case.\n\n【17】Postoperative immobilization further impaired a functional result in this case. Internal fixation must restore articular congruency and must be stable enough to allow for early mobilization. In this case the patient was immobilized for 10 days without continuous passive motion directly postoperative which resulted in only 65 degrees of ulnohumeral motion. However, impingement due to the depressed articular surface was the main reason for dysfunctional range of motion.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】An osteotomy with interposition of iliac crest bone graft and lengthening of the proximal olecranon can be used to restore the trochlear notch and ulnohumeral congruency.

Diagnostic criteria and classification of this challenging medical entity changed over time. Elevated absolute eosinophil count with extensive tissue infiltration and signs of organ damage of unknown origin is termed idiopathic HES. Hypereosinophilia is a highly hypercoagulable state; thus, a variety of thromboembolic complications may occur. Only a few reports of idiopathic HES patients with different forms of thrombosis are being published. We document a case of a young male presented with persistent abdominal pain with two eosinophilic colon tumors. The patient suffered from phlegmasia cerulea dolens and portal vein thrombosis, followed by pulmonary embolism and overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Corticosteroids successfully reduced and controlled eosinophil level while skilled anticoagulation and supportive management overcome DIC-associated complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is an extremely rare condition characterized by persistent peripheral eosinophilia and end-organ damage. The incidence ranges from 0.04 to 0.17 per 100,000 person-years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>, and medical knowledge is based mainly on case series reports. Eosinophilic infiltration of the heart, central nervous system, skin, and respiratory tract can occur; thus, clinical manifestation is variable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The precise etiology of HES is unknown, and the diagnosis is made by excluding eosinophilia secondary to allergies, medications, parasites, or viruses (e.g. HIV) and malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Historically, this unusual disease was first described by Hardy and Anderson 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, but diagnostic criteria were established in 1975 by Chusid et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, namely, absolute eosinophil count (AEC) >1.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL that lasted for at least 6 months, as well as signs or symptoms of organ injury. Currently, neither the duration nor the AEC criterion endured. Lower eosinophilia with significant tissue infiltration or AEC elevated >1.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL found twice on different occasions should be sufficient for HES diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Generally, asymptomatic hypereosinophilia should not be recognized as HES. In addition, a broader understanding of molecular pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of HES resulted in the development of the classification of HES subtypes. The HES main categories are: myeloproliferative (M-HES), lymphocytic (L-HES), familial, overlapping (organ-restricted eosinophilia), associated (present medical condition generating eosinophilia, for example, mastocytosis, inflammatory bowel disease, HIV infection and others) and idiopathic HES 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The WHO endorses a different approach to the categorization of eosinophilic syndromes, but with a common idiopathic HES entity as an exclusion diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Some of the M-HES patients lack defined myeloid neoplasm, but still present myeloproliferative disease-associated signs, such as hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Quite often, these patients are found to have a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene producing a highly active tyrosine kinase, which results in stem cell transformation and peripheral eosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This mutation warrants imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to be an effective treatment option for this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In L-HES cases, eosinophilia is a consequence of abnormal production of hematopioetins, especially interleukin-5 (IL-5), by an aberrant T-cell population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Several common subsets of activated T lymphocytes were characterized, including CD3<sup>−</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>−</sup> CD8<sup>−</sup>, CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> CD7<sup>−</sup>. L-HES patients usually present with a dermatological manifestation and should be closely monitored for progression to lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a progressive and deceitful disorder often accompanied by a variety of complications. Cardiac involvement, usually endocardial fibrosis, could lead to fully symptomatic heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. On the other hand, large-scale eosinophilic tissue infiltration and degranulation may result in massive venous and arterial thrombosis. Eosinophil peroxidase and major basic protein were found to promote platelet activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and thrombus formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. In numerous studies, HES was found to be associated with different presentations of thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14–18\\]</u>, which, when uncontrolled, can lead to consumptive coagulopathy. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters, including platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, and D-dimers, and could result in fatal bleeding complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The most commonly used medications used in HES are corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, interferon-α, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immunosuppressants, and recently, anti-IL-5 antibodies, mepolizumab, and reslizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy in most HES patients with a complete remission rate of over 80% within 1 month of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. However, in some HES cases, the corticosteroid response may vary.\n\n【5】In this paper, we present a unique case of a patient with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome who originally presented with acute abdominal pain and eosinophilic tumors within the colon wall found during laparotomy, complicated by a catastrophic thromboembolic event and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient signed an informed, written consent for the publication of his medical information and images.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】The 35-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department due to persistent abdominal pain, fever, and emesis. Abdominal ultrasound revealed fluid in the right iliac fossa and widened intestinal loops. Laboratory results showed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC 19.43 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL), 10.5% eosinophils (AEC 2.05 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL), hemoglobin (Hgb) 14.8 g/dL, platelets (PLT) 232.8 g/dL, and CRP 300.6 mg/L. Initial coagulation tests were normal. The patient was admitted to the surgery department and on day one underwent exploratory laparotomy which revealed two tumors involving the ascending and transverse colon, as well as the greater curvature of the stomach . A biopsy was performed and the histopathological results demonstrated extensive eosinophilic infiltration. In the following days, the patient reported persistent abdominal pain and new extensive swelling and cyanosis of the lower extremities (bilateral phlegmasia cerulea dolens). Laboratory parameters changed significantly: WBC 52.72 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL, 63.77% eosinophils (AEC 33.62 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL), Hgb 10.5 g/dL, PLT 7.97 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL, D-dimers markedly elevated and fibrinogen level significantly decreased (146 mg/dl). Doppler ultrasound examination confirmed massive deep vein thrombosis and computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed portal vein thrombosis—unfractionated heparin was immediately introduced intravenously. Shortly, the patient developed hemodynamic and respiratory instability. Emergency chest CTA revealed saddle pulmonary embolism . The patient was transferred to the intensive unit of the cardiology department for treatment and monitoring. Supportive treatment along with corticosteroids and hydroxyurea for eosinophilia lowering therapy was used. Thrombocytopenia (10 × 103/μL), elevated fibrin-related marker, e.g. D-dimer (13054 ug/L, ref. 0–278 ug/L), decreased fibrinogen level (70 mg/dl, ref. 200–472 mg/dl), and prolonged prothrombin time (16 sec. INR 1.46) were observed fulfilling the DIC criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The patient required multiple packed red blood cells, platelet concentrate, and plasma transfusion during the overt DIC phase of the disease. A diagnostic workup of extreme eosinophilia was performed. The stool and serologic studies were negative for parasitic infections. The total IgE concentration was >2500 IU/ml (ref. 0–200 IU/ml). Genetic studies investigated the presence of FLIP1L1-PDGFRA translocation, CHIC2 deletion, JAK2 V617F mutation, and BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. All results were negative. Bone marrow aspirate cytometry did not show increased blast count or signs of clonal proliferation. Immunological tests showed the absence of ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), EMA (antiendomysial antibodies), and anti-DGP antibodies (antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides). Therefore, there was no evidence of any ongoing autoimmune disease. The diagnosis of idiopathic HES was established.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Timeline showing laboratory results changes, significant clinical events, and treatment.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Chest angiotomography showing saddle pulmonary embolism.</u>\n\n【10】The clinical course of the patient was further complicated by headache and neurological symptoms: right amblyopia and left hemiplegia. A head CT scan was immediately performed and showed a cerebral infarct zone in the left occipital and right frontal lobes with secondary hemorrhagic transformation . TTE and TEE did not find signs of intracardiac thrombus. Protamine sulfate was administered to reverse the therapeutic effect of heparin. Fortunately, several days later, the neurological symptoms gradually improved and subcutaneous heparin was introduced. The eosinophil peripheral level was normalized after several days of corticosteroid therapy; however, the maintenance dose was prolonged. Laboratory signs of DIC resolved after 30 days of hospitalization. The prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin was prolonged. The patient was discharged on the 40th day of hospitalization in a good integrated condition. After 5 years of follow-up, the patient remains in good health with no hematological or thrombotic sequels.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Head tomography showing cerebral infarction with secondary hemorrhagic transformation.</u>\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】In this article, we report a case of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome that led to DIC with tremendous thromboembolic complications. Physiologically, eosinophils with their cytoplasmic granules containing catalytic enzymes are responsible for nonspecific inflammatory and allergic reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The gastrointestinal tract and pulmonary system are their primary residence areas, and the blood absolute eosinophil count only reflects tissue and organ concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Eosinophilia can be of primary, clonal origin, or secondary to defined medical disorders. Eosinophilia is defined as an increased number of eosinophils over 600 cells per microliter of blood, while in the case of hypereosinophilia the value exceeds 1,500 cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Hypereosinophilia of unknown background accompanied by organ damage is an idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our patient initially presented moderate hypereosinophilia at a level of AEC 2.0 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL; however, during his clinical course, the eosinophil count increased significantly to more than 33.0 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL (over 66% of WBC). Data suggest that highly abundant eosinophils in the circulation provoke thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–12, 22–24\\]</u>. Wallace et al. in a retrospective analysis found that thrombosis affects about 20% HES patients, but rarely is it a presenting symptom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The average AEC at the time of the thrombotic event was 15,000 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL. What is interesting is that in most cases analyzed, eosinophilia was untreated before thrombosis occurred. Probably, an early introduction of corticosteroids could effectively prevent life-threatening incidents.\n\n【14】HES-induced hypercoagulable state may eventually lead to overt DIC. However, scarce reports of such challenging cases are being published. In 1998, Yamada et al. described a young man who presented with abdominal pain, was diagnosed with HES and subsequently suffered a hemorrhagic stroke due to coagulation disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Uemura et al. reported a very interesting postmortem HES case of a man treated adequately with steroids but who suddenly died 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. An autopsy revealed massive pulmonary emboli but also two solid eosinophilic tumors of the ascending and transverse colon walls. Our patient was primarily diagnosed with eosinophilic tumors at the same locations, and similarly, we observed massive pulmonary embolism with visible thrombus origin site in deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities. Interestingly, we have also observed local vein thrombosis in the portal vein system, probably a direct effect of the presence of intra-abdominal mass. Uemura et al. have not reported signs of portal system vein thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. The authors suggested that large intestine tumors were responsible for the development of obstructive ileus, which would explain our patient’s initial clinical presentation. Park et al. presented a case of idiopathic HES complicated by multiorgan infarctions and DIC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. This young female, similarly to our patient, suffered from two focal intracranial hemorrhages. The authors advocated for the continuation of anticoagulation therapy presuming thrombotic background of hemorrhage. We decided to temporarily stop anticoagulation. Surprisingly, both strategies produced favorable outcomes. In summary, we report a rare case of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome complicated by thromboembolism and DIC, which was successfully treated with corticosteroids alone, and during a 5-year follow-up, the patient remains completely symptom-free.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:28:36", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:34:58", "cost": 381.668}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:34:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:28:36"}

Single coronary artery (SCA) is a rare anomaly with a prevalence of 0.024–0.066%. Some anomalies are merely benign anatomical variants, whereas some can result in myocardial ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmia. Case Presentation. We described seven cases in which all three major coronaries emerged from the right sinus of Valsalva via a single ostium and supplied the vast majority of the myocardium. A smaller branch arising from the left sinus supplied a modest quantity of myocardium in some of those few cases. These SCA variations do not exactly fit into any existing classification. It is unclear whether we need to modify previous classification systems or newer classification systems. Conclusions. SCA is divided based on its anomalous course and is usually a benign condition but it may present with cardiovascular complications. Clinicians should be aware of this entity along with the role of CT angiogram in its diagnosis and management.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Coronary anomalies are usually incidentally diagnosed during coronary angiogram (CAG), CT coronary angiogram (CCTA), or autopsy studies and affect 0.3–5.6% of the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These anomalies differ in number, location, coronary origin, and ostium orientation. A single coronary artery (SCA) is defined as “an isolated coronary artery that arises from a single coronary ostium and provides blood supply to the entire myocardium” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. They may or may not be associated with structural heart disease. According to the published literature, the prevalence of SCA in the general population is very low, ranging from 0.024 to 0.066% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. The majority of SCA are asymptomatic. However, in some cases, severe life-threatening arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or sudden cardiac death may occur, requiring medical or surgical intervention or coronary revascularisation procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】##### 1.1. Case Presentation\n\n【5】We reviewed 28,148 coronary angiograms performed at the Department of Cardiology, Kasturba Medical College and Hospital in Southern Karnataka, from 2014 to 2020 and reported 7 cases of the single coronary artery from the right sinus, including its variant, implying a prevalence of 0.025 percent in our population. We described seven cases of a single coronary artery that originated from the right sinus of Valsalva via a common ostium and supplied the majority of the myocardium.\n\n【6】###### 1.1.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 59-year-old hypertensive and diabetic female presented with a history of exertional fatigue NYHA (New York Heart Association) class II and nonanginal chest pain for the last 2 years. The electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram were normal but her treadmill test (TMT) was positive at 8 METS (metabolic equivalents) without any symptoms. The right and left sinus of Valsalva were successfully cannulated on CAG using 5F TIG (Tiger) 110 cms—OPTITORQUE® Diagnostic Catheter (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). An angiogram showed a single coronary artery (SCA) originating from a single right coronary ostium from the right sinus of Valsalva. The right coronary artery (RCA), left circumflex artery (LCX), and left anterior descending (LAD) arteries all emerged from the right coronary sinus and shared a common ostium. The right dominant coronary arterial system was observed, with the RCA continuing as the posterior descending artery (PDA), and it was normal. The LAD, LCX, and RCA were all normal . A branch originating from the left sinus which continued laterally over the left ventricle—likely an obtuse marginal branch. The left main coronary artery (LMCA) was not visible . CCTA confirmed the LAD course below the right ventricular outflow tract (subpulmonic) and then through the septum to the anterior interventricular groove, corresponding to Lipton’s class R-III-S . Neither SCA nor its branches had a malignant interarterial course. She experienced nonanginal chest pain, for which she was optimally treated with a statin and antihypertensive medications. She was doing well at the one-year follow-up.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a): Coronary angiogram showing the origin of all 3 major coronaries from the right coronary sinus via common ostium.

Case 2\n\n【10】A 61-year-old diabetic male presented with anginal pain and sweating for 6 hours. The ECG revealed an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction. The systemic examination was unremarkable. Troponin was elevated. CAG revealed an abnormal origin of all three major coronaries, LAD, LCX, and RCA, from the right sinus of Valsalva via a common ostium. The dominant RCA had complete thrombotic occlusion, whereas the LCX ostial and midportion had 90% stenosis. The LAD was normal . He underwent an emergency angioplasty. Following thrombus aspiration, the RCA lesion was stented with a (3 × 23 mm) everolimus-eluting stent (EES) . Balloon angioplasty was performed to the LCX lesion with a (2 × 15 mm) predilatation balloon. TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction)—3 flow was achieved, hence LCX was not stented . CCTA revealed that all 3 major coronaries originated from the right sinus via a common ostium with an interarterial course of the LAD, corresponding to Lipton’s class R-III-B . This course was considered malignant as compression between the aorta and pulmonary artery would lead to sudden cardiac death during vigorous exercise. He was optimally treated with dual antiplatelets, statin, and antianginal drugs. On 1 year follow-up, he was doing well.\n\n【11】###### 1.1.3. Case 3\n\n【12】A 71-year-old hypertensive female presented with a one-day history of chest pain. Baseline ECG showed T inversion in inferior and precordial leads. An echocardiogram showed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, mild concentric hypertrophy, and normal biventricular systolic function. Troponin was elevated. CAG revealed that all three major coronaries originated from the right sinus of Valsalva. Dominant RCA had 80–90% long tubular stenosis in the mid to distal part, and proximal PDA had 80% stenosis . The LMCA originated from the right sinus via a common ostium with the RCA and coursed retroaortically before splitting into the LAD and LCX, corresponding to Lipton’s class R-II-P. The LAD had a long segment calcific 80% stenosis, while the LCX was distally diseased . She had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the RCA, with two EES stents placed in the proximal and distal RCA.

Case 4\n\n【15】A 60-year-old hypertensive man presented with sudden onset of breathlessness for 1 day. There was a history of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND). A physical examination revealed a pulse rate of 140/min and a blood pressure of 190/100 mm Hg. On examination, bilateral crepitation was present. The ECG showed ST-T changes and troponin was elevated (0.331 ng/ml). An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function, trivial mitral regurgitation, and mild left ventricular hypertrophy. He was mechanically ventilated. CAG showed single-vessel disease with all 3 major coronaries originating from the right sinus via a common ostium. LAD had mild plaque . LCX ran retroaortic with ostioproximal 95% thrombotic occlusion . The dominant RCA had 60% stenosis in the midpart . He successfully underwent primary PCI to LCX with EES using a 6F Amplatz Right 1 guide. Postprocedure TIMI-3 flow was noted in LCX. CCTA revealed a prepulmonary course of the LAD, corresponding to Lipton’s class R-III-A. He was discharged on the third post-op day after being treated with dual antiplatelets, a statin, and diuretics. On 1 year follow-up, he was asymptomatic and doing well.\n\n【16】###### 1.1.5. Case 5\n\n【17】A 62-year-old asymptomatic diabetic male came for gall bladder surgery clearance and his TMT was positive at 7 METS. CAG was performed, which showed all 3 major coronaries LAD, LCX, and RCA arising from the right sinus via the common trunk. The dominant RCA showed 90% stenosis in the midpart. He successfully underwent PCI to the mid-RCA with a sirolimus-eluting stent. A CCTA was performed, which revealed a common trunk originating from the right coronary sinus and from which the LAD, LCX, and RCA originated . The LAD had an interarterial course between the pulmonary trunk and the aortic root with no stenosis, corresponding to Lipton’s class R-III-B . The LCX ran posteriorly between the aortic root and the left atrium—a retroaortic course with normal contrast opacification . The dominant RCA showed a patent RCA stent with its normal course. He was discharged on dual antiplatelets, statin, and antidiabetic medications, and he was doing well at the 1-year follow-up.\n\n【18】###### 1.1.6. Case 6\n\n【19】A 46-year-old hypertensive and hyperthyroid female presented with a history of one episode of giddiness but no syncopal attacks. She denied any other cardiac symptoms. Physical and cardiac examinations were both normal. The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy with a strain pattern and the echocardiogram showed apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without outflow obstruction with normal ejection fraction. Troponin T level was within normal limits. CAG showed an anomalous origin of the LMCA from the right sinus along with the RCA via a common ostium. The left main coronary artery crossed the aorta retroaortically and divided into the LAD and LCX branches, which supplied the respective territory . The angiographic findings were confirmed by CCTA and classified as Lipton’s class R-II-P. The RCA entered the right atrioventricular groove and continued distally as PDA in its normal course. All of the major epicardial coronaries were normal. However, smaller diagonal branch originating from the left sinus was also normal . She was advised of medical management and was doing well after a one-year follow-up.\n\n【20】###### 1.1.7. Case 7\n\n【21】A 68-year-old hypertensive male presented with complaints of weakness in the left upper limb of 1-month duration. Physical and cardiac examinations were both normal. The ECG and echocardiogram were both normal. MRI revealed a subacute infarct in the right precentral gyrus, as well as a subacute infarct in the right centrum semiovale and corona radiata. Carotid doppler showed an echogenic thrombus for a length of 2 cm in the right proximal internal carotid artery (ICA), causing near-complete occlusion. A carotid angiogram revealed 100% thrombotic occlusion of the right proximal ICA. CAG revealed that all 3 major coronaries (LAD, LCX, and RCA) originated from the right coronary cusp via a common ostium , and CCTA revealed Lipton’s class R-III-A. The LAD emerged from the right sinus, traversed the left side, and entered the anterior interventricular groove. The LAD was normal, but its diagonal branch showed 70% stenosis. The LCX emerged from the right sinus, travelled retroaortically, and then continued distally in the posterior atrioventricular groove. The dominant RCA arose from the right sinus and continued in its normal anatomical course. He was asymptomatic for his cardiac condition, so he was prescribed single antiplatelet, statin, and antihypertensive medications.\n\n【22】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【23】Coronary anomalies are rare and usually diagnosed incidentally during coronary angiography, CT coronary angiography, or autopsy studies. Its prevalence is approximately 0.3–5.6% in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Among these, the single coronary artery is a very rare condition, with an estimated prevalence of 0.024–0.066% based on a published literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. SCA is defined as “an isolated coronary artery that arises from a single coronary ostium and provides blood supply to the entire myocardium” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It may not be associated with other congenital heart diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Several classification systems for SCA had been described. The classification for SCA was introduced by Smith, Ogden and Goodyear, Lipton et al. and Shirani and Roberts, to describe the origin and course of SCA. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u> None of these classification systems are complete, but they do aid in the classification of various types of SCA. However, Lipton et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> classification system is widely used, and it was later modified by Yamanaka and Hobbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> in 1990, based on anatomical distribution, ostial location, and the course of the transverse trunk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【25】We described 7 cases of SCA (∼0.025% prevalence) in which all three major coronaries originated from the right sinus of Valsalva via a common ostium and supplied the majority of the myocardium. This type of anatomy corresponds to the R-II or R-III type of Lipton’s classification. Out of 7 cases, two cases had a branch originating from the left sinus supplying the smaller area of the myocardium. Even though there were two coronary ostia in our patient, the entire heart was essentially supplied by the right coronary system. Because these cases did not exactly correspond to any of the aforementioned classification systems, we have considered them as a variant of SCA. Except for the aberrant small branch, this anatomy correlates with Lipton’s type R-II or R-III. Even in the literature, it is unclear whether such cases should be classified as single coronary systems or not. A similar type of case was reported by Subban et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> where the RCA and LAD arose from the right sinus and the RCA continued as the LCX distally, along with a small diminutive diagonal branch from the left sinus. They had described such a case as a single coronary system as the majority of the heart was supplied by the right coronary system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. We need further data to update these classification systems to include such cases.\n\n【26】A coronary angiogram can clearly identify anomalies in 53% of cases only. CT angiography can precisely delineate anatomic abnormality, acute angle take-off, the number of Ostia, the course of the coronaries, and their relationship to the great arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. A 64-slice CT angiogram has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 96% for detecting coronary stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The majority of individuals with SCA are asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms; nevertheless, certain variants of SCA can cause angina, myocardial ischemia, syncope, and severe life-threatening arrhythmias. Sudden cardiac death can be a presenting feature if SCA courses between the pulmonary artery and the aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our 2 cases had such type of interarterial course of LAD. According to Shirani and Roberts, 15 percent of SCA cases develop angina and ischemia as a result of aberrant coronary anatomy rather than coronary artery diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Anomalous LAD originating from the right sinus can take one of four paths: septal, anterior free wall, retroaortic, or interarterial. The septal course is mostly benign and no cases of sudden cardiac death have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Although anomalous coronaries are rare, they continue to be at risk for CAD and should be treated in the same way as native coronaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Hutchins et al. showed that the abnormal tortuous course of the proximal part of anomalous coronaries is susceptible to lipid accumulation, predisposing them to increased atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Anomalous LCX from the right sinus has a higher risk of stenosis compared to normal origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Considering the wide range of anatomical presentations of SCA, a comprehensive strategy involving cardiologists and cardiac surgeons should be considered while selecting the most appropriate treatment. A severe symptomatic patient with CAD requires angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, whereas minimally symptomatic patients with no significant CAD require medical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Patients who present with syncope of unknown origin, malignant arrhythmia, or resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest due to an abnormal interarterial course are usually advised to undergo surgical management via aortocoronary bypass, coronary reimplantation, or unroofing of an intramural coronary segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Surgery is recommended if there is evidence of myocardial ischemia, even in asymptomatic patients with an interarterial course; it is also recommended for patients under 30–35 years of age, even if the stress test is negative. The risk of sudden cardiac death in elderly people declines with age and is exceedingly low, possibly due to the hardening of the aortic wall in the elderly population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In our series, 4 out of 7 patients who underwent coronary artery stenting had no symptoms on follow-up. The other 3 patients had no coronary artery disease and were followed up periodically as they were asymptomatic.\n\n【31】#### 3\\. Conclusions\n\n【32】SCA is one of the rarest coronary anomalies. It is classified based on its anomalous course. SCA is usually a benign condition but it may present with myocardial ischemia, life-threatening arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death. Clinicians and surgeons should be aware of this entity along with the role of CT angiogram in its diagnosis and management.\n\n【33】#### Abbreviations\n\n| SCA: | Single coronary artery |\n| --- | --- |\n| CTCA: | Coronary computed tomography angiography |\n| CAG: | Coronary angiogram |\n| NYHA: | New York Heart Association |\n| METS: | Metabolic equivalents |\n| TIMI: | Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction |\n| LAD: | Left anterior descending artery |\n| RCA: | Right coronary artery |\n| LCx: | Left circumflex artery |\n| LMCA: | Left main coronary artery |\n| EES: | Everolimus-eluting stent |\n| TMT: | Treadmill test |\n| ICA: | Internal carotid artery |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:08:23", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:08:41", "cost": 17.691}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:08:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:08:23"}

Ultrasound (US) evaluation of the gallbladder is usually sufficient to diagnose MSG although other modalities such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) have been described to establish the diagnosis.

Kounis syndrome is the concurrence of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) caused by coronary vasospasms, acute myocardial infarctions, or stent thromboses in case of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions. Kounis syndrome is mediated by mast cells that interact with macrophages and T-lymphocytes, causing degranulation and inflammation with cytokine release. It is a life-threatening condition that has many trigger factors and is most commonly caused by medicines. Case Presentation. A 71-year-old male was admitted with a fever of five days’ duration associated with cellulitis, for which he had been treated with clindamycin and flucloxacillin before admission. He was a diagnosed patient with hypertension and dyslipidemia five years ago. After taking the antibiotics, he had developed generalized itching followed by urticaria suggesting an allergic reaction. Therefore, he was admitted to the hospital. After admission, he developed an ischaemic-type chest pain associated with autonomic symptoms and shortness of breath. An immediate ECG was taken that showed ST-segment depressions in the chest leads V4–V6, confirmed by a repeat ECG. Troponin I was 8 ng/mL. Acute management of ACS was started, and prednisolone 10 mg daily dose was given. After complete recovery, the patient was discharged with aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, losartan, isosorbide mononitrate, and nicorandil. Prednisolone 10 mg daily dose was given for five days after discharge. Conclusion. In immediate hypersensitivity, with persistent cardiovascular instability, Kounis syndrome should be considered, and an electrocardiogram and other appropriate assessments and treatments should be initiated. Prompt management of the allergic reaction and the ACS is vital for a better outcome of Kounis syndrome.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cardiovascular manifestations associated with allergy, hypersensitivity, and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions began to emerge seven decades ago in the medical literature. However, the clinical condition of allergic angina syndrome, which progresses to allergic acute myocardial infarction, was not described until 1991 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Allergic angina syndrome and allergic myocardial infarction are ubiquitous diseases that affect patients of any age. They cover a broad spectrum of mast cell-activation disorders that are referred to as Kounis syndrome. The definition of this syndrome is the concurrence of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the setting of allergic or hypersensitivity and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid insults. These cases of ACS may occur due to coronary spasms, acute myocardial infarctions, or stent thromboses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The primary inflammatory cells involved in the development of Kounis syndrome are mast cells that interact with macrophages and T-lymphocytes. It causes mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, neutral proteases chymase, tryptase, heparin, and cathepsin-D, with increased production of leukotrienes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Medicines represent the most common trigger for Kounis syndrome in clinical practice. The most commonly reported medicines include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. ibuprofen), antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, and anticancer drugs (e.g. fluorouracil) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Kounis syndrome is a complex situation involving two severe circumstances, an acute allergic reaction and an acute coronary event. Thus, the prognosis of Kounis syndrome is relatively poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore, the management should address both prior given concerns that envisage the complexity of the management. Herein, we report a case of Kounis syndrome possibly triggered by antibiotics administered due to cellulitis of the right lower limb.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 71-year-old male was admitted with a fever of five days’ duration and a reddish swollen right lower limb that had occurred following a wound caused by a leech bite. He had initially consulted a general practitioner before admission who had diagnosed cellulitis, and the patient had been prescribed clindamycin and flucloxacillin on day 2 of the fever. After taking the antibiotics, he had developed generalized itching followed by urticaria. However, there had not been any shortness of breath. Then, antibiotics had been changed on day 4 of fever by the general practitioner due to the possibility of an allergic reaction. Then, he was given cephalexin. However, the allergic symptoms were persisting, and the wound condition had not been improved. Therefore, he was admitted to the local hospital on day 5 of fever. After being admitted to the hospital, he developed ischaemic-type chest pain associated with autonomic symptoms and shortness of breath. The pain was slightly reduced by a glyceryl trinitrate sublingual tablet given. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was taken immediately, showing ST-segment depressions in the chest leads, V4–V6 . A repeat ECG confirmed similar findings .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Electrocardiogram taken immediately after admission, showing ST-segment depression in the chest leads, V4–V6.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Repeat electrocardiogram taken after admission, showing ST-segment depression in the chest leads, V4–V6.</u>\n\n【9】The acute management of ACS was carried out at the local hospital, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary-care center for further management. At the tertiary-care center, the antiplatelets and statins were continued. Enoxaparin 60 mg, six doses, and prednisolone 10 mg daily dose were given. ECGs  taken at the tertiary-care center showed normal findings. Troponin I level was initially 8 ng/mL and then reduced to 0.28 ng/mL four days after the onset of chest pain.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Electrocardiogram taken at the tertiary-care center after treatment showing normal findings.</u>\n\n【11】He was a patient diagnosed with hypertension and dyslipidemia for five years without any hypertensive complications. He had also taken treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease for seven years. Nevertheless, he did not have any previous history of diabetes mellitus, transient ischaemic attacks, or cerebrovascular accidents. He had a significant history of allergies to tetracycline, amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, clindamycin, and mushrooms. He did not have any family history of ischaemic heart disease. He was a heavy smoker who had consumed 40 pack-years of cigarettes and was an alcoholic who had taken four to five bottles of toddy per day for thirty years which amounted to 15 units per day; however, he claimed abstinence for five years.\n\n【12】After full recovery, he was discharged with aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, losartan, isosorbide mononitrate, and nicorandil. Prednisolone 10 mg daily dose was prescribed for five days.\n\n【13】He was next followed up at the cardiac rehabilitation clinic. Six months after the initial presentation, he presented again with stable angina, and the exercise ECG showed stage II inferolateral ischemia. A 2D echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 59% with normal left ventricular systolic dysfunction. We calculated his TIMI score, which was 6 out of 7. Although a coronary angiogram was planned, the patient defaulted follow-up.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Kounis syndrome was defined in 1991 as “the coincidental occurrence of chest pain and allergic reactions accompanied by clinical and laboratory findings of classic angina pectoris caused by inflammatory mediators released during the allergic insult” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It comprises the whole clinical spectrum of acute myocardial ischemia, from stable angina to acute myocardial infarction, which coincides with “allergic” (hypersensitivity, anaphylactic, or anaphylactoid) reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Three variants of Kounis syndrome have been described. The type I variant includes normal or nearly normal coronary arteries without risk factors for coronary artery disease. The type II variant includes the culprit but quiescent preexisting atheromatous disease. The type III variant includes coronary artery stent thrombosis in which aspirated thrombus specimens are stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa that demonstrate the presence of eosinophils and mast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Type III variant has two subtypes; subtype a includes patients with coronary stent thrombosis, and subtype b includes patients with stent restenosis due to allergic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Recently, a new variant IV of Kounis syndrome has been proposed, not scientifically established yet 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Involvement of the cardiovascular system in anaphylaxis occurs in two-thirds of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the incidence of Kounis syndrome during acute allergic reactions has not been precisely established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In a prospective study performed at an emergency department, 27 out of 793 patients consulting for allergic reactions were diagnosed with Kounis syndrome, rendering an incidence of 3.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Myocardial injury detected by elevation of troponin I was diagnosed in 22 cases (7.3%) in another retrospective study reviewing 300 cases of anaphylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Although anaphylactic reactions associated with cardiovascular alterations are frequent and transient, in some cases, they may result in extensive and life-threatening myocardial damage. In such incidence, many mast cells have been found in the tunica media and the adventitia of large coronary vessels and small intramural coronary arteries. During anaphylaxis, coronary hypoperfusion caused by systemic vasodilation, plasma leakage, volume loss due to increased vascular permeability, and reduced venous return can contribute to cardiac output suppression, leading to further myocardial damage and ventricular dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The primary inflammatory cells involved in the development of Kounis syndrome are mast cells that interact with macrophages and T-lymphocytes via multidirectional stimuli. During allergy, hypersensitivity, and anaphylaxis, mast cell degranulation occurs, and various stored and newly formed inflammatory mediators are released locally and to the systemic circulation. These inflammatory mediators include biogenic amines such as histamine, chemokines, enzymes such as the neutral proteases chymase and tryptase, cathepsin-D, peptides, proteoglycans, cytokines, growth factors, and arachidonic acid products such as leukotrienes, thromboxane, prostacyclin, PAF, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is shown that mast cells in human coronary atheromas contain TNF-α 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Mast cells can be typically activated via several pathways, which may contribute to Kounis syndrome. One is through allergen cross linking with allergen-specific IgE bound to high-affinity Fc epsilon receptor. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation can also occur via the anaphylatoxins, including complement C1q, C3a C4, C5a, and Factor B. This complement pathway activation involves IL-5 and tryptase, more commonly recognized in patients who develop renal failure or fatal cerebral events. Mast cells can also be activated via low-affinity Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2), which activates mast cells via non-Fcε receptors. Another possible pathway is through neuropeptides, including corticotropin-releasing hormone, neurotensin (NT), and substance P (SP) via high-affinity receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Risk factors of Kounis syndrome include a history of previous allergy, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Various causes have been found to trigger Kounis syndrome, and more triggers are being identified. The most common trigger of Kounis syndrome is antibiotics (27.4%), followed by insect bites. Other causes include foods, latex, and dialysate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Medicines that may trigger Kounis syndrome include analgesics, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticancer drugs.\n\n【21】Regarding Kounis syndrome triggered by antibiotics, cases have been reported on amoxicillin, amikacin, cefuroxime, penicillin, sulbactam/cefoperazone, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Clinical studies indicate that allergic patients who are simultaneously exposed to several allergens have more symptoms than monosensitized individuals. The more medicines an atopic patient is exposed to, the easier and quicker anaphylaxis and Kounis syndrome can occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Our patient was previously allergic to amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, clindamycin, and tetracycline. Nevertheless, the general practitioner had put on flucloxacillin and clindamycin without taking a proper allergic history. After identifying the allergic reaction, the antibiotics were changed to cephalexin, and the patient developed Kounis syndrome. Thus, there is a possibility that this patient was exposed to three possible allergens, which would have easily triggered Kounis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【22】A case of clindamycin-triggered Kounis syndrome has been reported in a 17-year-old boy who has taken treatment for acute tonsillitis and subsequently developing acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Our patient was treated with clindamycin and flucloxacillin, which might be the possible triggers of Kounis syndrome, manifested as acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with ST-segment depression in V4–V6 leads. However, it is difficult to determine which caused the symptoms since the patient claimed to be allergic to both antibiotics. There are no reported cases of Kounis syndrome secondary to flucloxacillin.\n\n【23】The diagnosis of Kounis syndrome is based on clinical symptoms and signs and laboratory, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and angiographic evidence. A variety of these findings might accompany allergic symptomatology that helps to establish the correct diagnosis. The symptoms include acute chest pain, chest discomfort, dyspnea, faintness, headache, nausea, pruritus, and skin itching. Therefore, entertaining a high index of paramount suspicion is important. Patients with systemic allergic reactions associated with clinical, electrocardiographic, and laboratory findings of acute myocardial ischemia should be suspected of having Kounis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Newer diagnostic techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and myocardial scintigraphy can help to confirm the diagnosis. Increased serum tryptase, histamine, cardiac biomarkers, and cardiac troponins are beneficial findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In this case, the patient developed an ischaemic-type chest pain, and the immediately taken electrocardiogram showed ischaemic changes. He had an elevated troponin I level with symptoms of hypersensitivity, and the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome was made.\n\n【24】Management of Kounis syndrome is a complex task that requires rapid treatment decisions aimed at myocardium revascularisation and treating the concomitant allergic reaction. Currently, guidelines for the treatment of Kounis syndrome are lacking. Most of the evidence on the efficacy of the treatment is based on individual case reports or case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. A recent review conducted by Kounis himself recommends different management approaches for the multiple kinds of variants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The two main aspects of management include cardiological evaluation and treatment of ACS and emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions. As initial steps for managing ACS, nitroglycerine infusion or tablets can be given, and calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or diltiazem can be considered. Intramuscular epinephrine, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, glucocorticoid, and H1-blockers can be given to manage the allergic reaction after removing the tentative allergen. Next, continuous monitoring is indicated for the type I variant, and dual antiplatelet therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention can be performed for type II and type III variants. It is also essential to evaluate the ejection fraction and hemodynamic instability. Timely referrals for the CCU or ICU should be done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This patient was managed initially with nitroglycerin sublingual tablet and next with dual antiplatelet therapy. Six doses of subcutaneous enoxaparin and prednisolone to control the allergic reaction were also given. He was discharged with nitrates, dual antiplatelets, and antihypertensives, considering his chronic medical conditions. According to the literature, although metoprolol was given to this patient, it is contraindicated in Kounis syndrome. Beta-blockers can aggravate coronary vasospasms in patients with type II Kounis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【26】So far, there are only seven cases of Kounis syndrome reported in Sri Lanka. Among them, five cases have depicted ST-elevation myocardial infarctions. One case has reported amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-induced Kounis syndrome with widespread ST elevations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In another case, the patient has presented with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia without any obvious trigger of hypersensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Two other cases of Kounis syndrome have been reported following snake bites, one following a hump-nosed pit viper bite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> and another a cobra bite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Another case has been reported following a hornet sting causing widespread T inversions in the electrocardiogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. In two cases, the patients have succumbed following Kounis syndrome, one following ceftazidime injection where postmortem found myocardial necrosis with elevated tryptase level suspecting the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The other fatal case of Kounis syndrome was an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction following anaphylaxis after ingestion of prawns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Therefore, we report the second case of Kounis syndrome with non-ST-elevation of myocardial infarction and the first one with ST-segment depression in Sri Lanka.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【28】This case emphasizes that physicians should be aware of allergic angina syndrome, also known as Kounis syndrome, when a patient simultaneously develops symptoms of ACS and hypersensitivity features. In such cases, other supportive investigations such as electrocardiograms and cardiac biomarkers should be conducted to support the diagnosis, and the management should be initiated promptly. Peripheral blood eosinophilia also supports the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome even in the absence of other features of hypersensitivity.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 71-year-old man was presented with severe back pain to the orthopedic department, Kanto Rosai Hospital. Bone metastasis to Th1 of unknown origin was confirmed by CT scan, MRI, and bone scintigraphy. As his prostate specific antigen level was very high (387 ng/ml), he was referred to the urologic department. Digital rectal examination showed locally advanced prostate cancer. Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy and bilateral orchiectomy were performed on the same day in February, 2010. A smooth stone of 11 mm in diameter was incidentally found moving freely in the right hydrocele space . Bilateral testes (right 24 g, left 24 g) and epididymis were anatomically unremarkable, not indicating previous infection or trauma, but a little amount of serous liquid was drained from the space between the tunicae lining the scrotum and the testicles tunica vaginalis.

WE due to peptic ulcer disease in previous reports was substantially associated with thiamine deficiency due to recurrent vomiting or surgical procedures.

Introduction\n\n【3】Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by nystagmus and ophthalmoplegia, ataxia of gait, and mental confusion. It results from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency and is observed mainly in alcoholics. Here, we describe a case of non-alcoholic WE in peptic ulcer disease. WE due to peptic ulcer disease in previous reports was substantially associated with thiamine deficiency due to recurrent vomiting or surgical procedures; the mechanisms of thiamine deficiency after surgical procedures include the occurrence of recurrent vomiting, poor compliance with an adequate dietary intake, and the reduced area of the gastrointestinal mucosa for absorbing thiamine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In our case, however, there was no history of vomiting or gastrointestinal surgery. We consider that peptic ulcer disease itself provoked thiamine deficiency due to malabsorption.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with subacute progression of diplopia, gait disturbance, and mental status change. He began to notice slight diplopia three months before admission, but he could work as a carpenter until several weeks before admission. According to his family members, he ate a balanced diet regularly and had not consumed alcohol in recent years. His past medical history was hemorrhagic gastric ulcer managed without surgery two years earlier, and then intake of lansoprazole was started. There was no history of vomiting lately. His family history was unremarkable. On admission, he exhibited mental sluggishness, disorientation, and anterograde amnesia. Neurological examination showed ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and ataxia. Blood tests demonstrated a low thiamine concentration (12.7 ng/mL; normal range 21.3–81.9 ng/mL). Results of other blood tests, including vitamins B2, B6, B12, folic acid, nicotinic acid, complete blood count, kidney and thyroid function, magnesium concentration, CEA, CA19-9, and IgG anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody, were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed symmetrical high-intensity lesions in the medial thalami, hypothalami, periaqueductal grey matter, and the floor of the fourth ventricle on T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images . Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was unremarkable. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrated gastric ulcer scars accompanied by marked deformity . The duodenum and other parts of the gut were normal.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | MRI-FLAIR images of the brain showed symmetrical high-intensity lesions  in the floor of the fourth ventricle (a), periaqueductal grey matter (b), hypothalami (b), and medial thalami (c). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Marked deformity and shortening of the gastric angle (arrowhead) and lesser curvature (arrow), and insufficient distention of the pyloric antrum on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (a) and gastric fluoroscopy (b). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】Intravenous thiamine (up to 1500 mg per day) was immediately administered for suspected WE on admission, and his consciousness, ocular manifestation and gait disturbance were markedly improved. However, disorientation and anterograde amnesia remained, and over the next several weeks he developed confabulation suggesting Korsakoff’s syndrome. Multiple and repetitive biopsies of the gastric mucosa over the next two years showed chronic gastritis without evidence of malignancy.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】The present patient was diagnosed as having WE based on the low serum thiamine concentration, response of neurological signs to parenteral thiamine administration, and typical brain MRI findings. Clinical settings related to WE described in previous reports were thoroughly ruled out: chronic alcohol abuse and malnutrition; history of gastrointestinal surgical procedures; unbalanced nutrition including staple diet of polished rice; recurrent vomiting or chronic diarrhea; cancer; systemic diseases such as renal disease, hyperthyroidism, and chronic infectious febrile diseases; magnesium depletion; the use of drugs causing WE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In general, thiamine is known to be absorbed in the duodenum. However, SLC19A2, one of the high-affinity thiamine transporters, was reported to show greater expression in the stomach more than in the duodenum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This finding suggests that the stomach plays a more important role in thiamine absorption than previously thought. Thus, we consider that thiamine deficiency in this patient was due to thiamine malabsorption in the stomach involved with severe gastric mucosal lesions.\n\n【12】Patients with peptic ulcer disease often receive a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs have been recognized to induce hypomagnesemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, which can provoke WE by suboptimum thiamine phosphorylation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although the use of PPIs should receive attention as a cause of WE, we do not consider in this respect that the PPI therapy was related to WE in our patient because the serum magnesium level was normal. Meanwhile, the mechanism of thiamine absorption in gastrointestinal lumen involves hydrogen cations, and the regular use of antacids may interfere with the absorption of thiamine though there has been no direct evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Accordingly, we cannot completely deny the possibility that the long-term PPI use induced thiamine deficiency in this patient.\n\n【13】Since not every individual with a similar degree of thiamine deficiency develops WE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, genetic factors may also be likely to contribute disease expression in our patient. Some studies have shown that variations in genes coding for transketolase and the high-affinity thiamine transporters are implicated in the pathophysiology of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–11\\]</u>. In WKS, several genetic defects might combine with environmental factors to produce clinical manifestations when thiamine storage declines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【14】WE due to peptic ulcer disease in previous reports was substantially associated with thiamine deficiency due to recurrent vomiting or surgical procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. This case is different in that respect, and there is the possibility that peptic ulcer disease itself provoked thiamine deficiency due to malabsorption. Indeed, it is unclear why only this case developed WE despite the large number of patients with peptic ulcer disease. However, clinicians should keep in mind that WE can occur as a rare complication of peptic ulcer disease because WE is a serious and preventable disease. We wish to emphasize that occasional measurement of blood thiamine levels is desirable in patients with severe gastric mucosal lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:08", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:14", "cost": 5.883}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:06"}

It is an uncommon situation that may lead to several neurological complications. We report varicella zoster virus (VZV) meningitis in a 14-year-old healthy boy with no antecedent of rash. On his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, VZV DNA was detected. The rapid HIV test was negative. The treatment using acyclovir (20 mg/kg/8h) was effective, and the child’s clinical condition rapidly improved.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella zoster virus. It causes severe complications in adults and adolescents. Immunodeficient people are particularly at a higher risk of developing primary multisystemic infection with pulmonary, neurological, and/or hepatic complications. Reinfection is probably more common than previously thought, but its management is similar to primary infection. Reactivation, commonly known as shingles, may also manifest in the form of meningitis, vasculopathy, and disseminated shingles in immunodeficient patients.\n\n【4】We report a case of a healthy child with viral meningitis due to VZV reactivation. The rare isolation of VZV in CSF in immunocompetent children and the absence of skin rash make this case interesting.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 14-year-old healthy boy presented with a headache, vomiting, and a fever for over 5 days. He also had neck stiffness. He had no past history of skin rash and was neither recently vaccinated nor in contact with infected individuals. He had chickenpox at 18 months and had completed all his vaccines according to the Moroccan national vaccination program.\n\n【7】On physical examination, the patient was febrile at 38.1°C; he had nuchal rigidity, without any abnormal neurological signs or skin rash. The vital signs were as follows: pulse rate was 64 beats/minute, respiratory rate was 20 beats/minute, and SpO<sub>2</sub> was 99% on room air. Laboratory tests revealed normal white blood cells and platelet count (WBC: 9830/mm and PLT: 277.000/mm) and normal C-reactive protein (0.3 mg/L).\n\n【8】Due to the presence of the meningeal syndrome, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was drawn and analyzed. It contained 60/mm<sup>3</sup> of WBCs and 80% mononuclear; CSF protein was 27 mg/dl, and CSF glucose was 77 mg/dl (serum glucose: 115 mg/dl). He was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone awaiting bacterial culture.\n\n【9】On the second day of evolution, the child still had the headache. Results of bacterial culture came out negative, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the CSF for bacterial and viral identification revealed varicella zoster virus (VZV). The intravenous ceftriaxone was stopped, and acyclovir was started at a dose of 20 mg/kg every 8 hours for a duration of 10 days.\n\n【10】On the 3rd day of treatment with acyclovir, the patient became apyretic and asymptomatic. A rapid HIV test was requested in view of the PCR results; it also came out negative.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】The varicella zoster virus (VZV) belongs to the family of Herpesviridae, a double-stranded DNA virus enclosed in a cubic symmetry nucleocapsid surrounded by a seed coat and an envelope. Being a fragile virus, it is quickly degraded by heat and loses its infectious power after a freeze-thaw cycle. It is fundamentally dermotropic; the virus has neurotropism like the herpes simplex virus (HSV), and it can also remain latent in sensory ganglia. The reactivation of the virus leads to clinical manifestations of shingles and sometimes to a disseminated disease in immunocompromised children.\n\n【13】Children who are in contact with varicella in the first year of life may have zoster during childhood, but there are no publications to support this and further demonstrate that these children are at a higher risk for VZV associated with central nervous system (CNS) manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The CNS manifestations, especially in meningitis caused by VZV, might be as a result of both primary and reactivated disease or might be the cause of vaccine strain reactivation in immunocompetent children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Meningitis in varicella zoster is rare. A report by Galil et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> showed that, in a series of 859 adults, only 0.5% presented with herpes zoster infection. Pahud et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported meningitis at 50% in a series of 26 patients presenting with VZV PCR-positive in cerebrospinal fluid in patients aged between 12 and 85 years (median, 46 years).\n\n【16】Other cases report that meningitis in children is usually associated with skin rash due to the past history of varicella primary infection or due to the reactivation of the VZV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5–7\\]</u>. Sometimes, the CNS manifestation may appear before the skin rash in varicella and in herpes zoster 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Aseptic meningitis due to VZV is usually associated with varicella in immunocompromised children. The absence of rash is uncommon in immunocompetent children according to a report from a hospital in southern Iran in which 2 cases out of 30 were positive for PCR of CSF: VZV was isolated from these samples which were collected from children aged between 2 months and 15 years presenting with aseptic meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In adults, only one case was reported in a woman presenting with aseptic meningitis with hypoglycorrhachia without skin rash 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The uniqueness of our case lies in the fact that this incident of aseptic meningitis which affected an immunocompetent child was due to VZV reactivation, but the child did not present any skin lesions. In pediatrics, it is rare that the PCR in cerebrospinal fluid can isolate VZV in case of unexplained aseptic meningitis.\n\n【19】We conclude that aseptic meningitis is one of the rare complications of VZV reactivation without skin rash and PCR is the first go to diagnostic test to identify the etiology of the viral meningitis.

Introduction\n\n【3】Graves’ disease is an autoimmune thyroid disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The disease is characterized by a hyperthyroid state secondary to autoantibodies that bind to and activate thyrotropin receptors, leading to an increase in thyroid hormone production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients of any age can be affected, however, the peak incidence is reported between the ages of 30 and 50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Common manifestations of Graves’ disease include weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, fatigue, tremors, and exophthalmos, occurring in more than 50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Rare manifestations such as localized dermatopathy and thyroid acropachy (i.e. clubbing) have been reported in less than 1% of cases. Men may present with decreased libido or erectile dysfunction, and women may present with irregular menses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In rare cases, findings may predominate in one organ system; isolated findings of diarrhea, anxiety, or gynecomastia (as in our case) may occur, distracting from the correct diagnosis. Gynecomastia is a common finding in hyperthyroidism, but it is rarely the presenting symptom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We present a case of Graves’ disease with a less common presentation of a unilateral breast mass.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 37-year-old Caucasian male presented to the primary care clinic with the chief complaint of a tender right-sided breast mass. The patient also reported decreased appetite and a forty-pound weight loss over the preceding five months. The breast mass had been present for about six weeks and was not associated with galactorrhea. The patient denied any fevers or night sweats and denied taking any hormonal or nutritional supplements. There was no reported family history of breast cancer or endocrine disorder. During a physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits, and the patient was noted to be thin, with a BMI of 21.6. Breast examination revealed a one-centimeter-by-one-centimeter, tender, right-sided mass without nipple discharge. The thyroid gland was nonpalpable, and there was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.\n\n【6】Laboratory evaluation revealed TSH of 0.01 mIU/L (reference range 0.40–4.5 mIU/L) with free T4 3.3 ng/dL (reference 0.93–1.7 ng/dL) and total T3 335 ng/dL (reference 80–200 ng/dL). The thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin level was noted to be >500 (normal <122%). Prolactin was found to be 7.2 ng/mL (reference range 4.0–15.2 ng/mL), and testosterone was noted to be 624 ng/dL (reference range 800–1080 ng/dL). A bilateral diagnostic mammogram revealed bilateral gynecomastia, right greater than left . A nuclear medicine thyroid uptake scan was subsequently ordered, which showed the diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with homogenous increased uptake throughout, consistent with Graves’ disease.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the (a) right breast and (b) left breast showing flame-shaped subareolar densities consistent with gynecomastia.</u>\n\n【8】On initial presentation, there was a high index of suspicion for breast cancer due to presenting symptoms of the right-sided breast mass associated with significant weight loss. The bilateral diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound were ordered for further workup of possible malignancy. Hyperthyroidism was also considered due to weight loss and palpitations; however, it was initially lower on differential diagnoses.\n\n【9】The patient was started on atenolol 25 mg daily upon laboratory diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. After confirmation of Graves’ disease on the thyroid uptake scan, the patient was referred to endocrinology. He was subsequently prescribed methimazole 10 mg twice daily.\n\n【10】After two months of treatment with twice daily methimazole, repeat bloodwork showed TSH 0.45 mIU/L (within normal limits), free T4 0.39 ng/dL (normal 0.93–1.7 ng/dL), and total T3 58 (normal 80–200). On repeat evaluation, the breast mass was no longer palpable, and the patient reported significantly improved energy levels and decreased palpitations. The weight of the patient, however, was unchanged. Over the last five years, multiple attempts at tapering off methimazole have been unsuccessful. He has been maintained on 5 mg methimazole daily with stable thyroid function labs. He has declined definitive therapy with radioactive iodine ablation.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Gynecomastia is defined as an enlargement in glandular tissue of the breast, which may present as unilateral or bilateral breast enlargement. This condition is commonly seen in patients with chronic liver disease and as a result of certain drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although it is rare, gynecomastia has been described as a common finding in hyperthyroid states, specifically in Graves’ disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. As a cutaneous feature of thyrotoxicosis, gynecomastia can be seen in 10–40% of cases; however, it is rarely seen as the presenting feature of the disease. It has been reported as a presenting feature of hyperthyroidism in less than ten cases to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The development of gynecomastia involves an imbalance between free estrogen and free androgen actions in breast tissue. Breast tissue enlargement occurs when there is a relative increase in estrogen production. In hyperthyroid states, the increase in concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin binds testosterone more avidly than estrogen, leading to an increase in the concentration of bioavailable estrogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Treatment of hyperthyroidism with control of thyrotoxicosis results in resolution of gynecomastia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our patient presented with the chief complaint of a unilateral breast mass associated with forty-pound weight loss. This presentation was initially concerning to the patient and physician for breast cancer due to the predominant involvement of only one organ system. On further investigation with diagnostic mammogram, the patient was found to have bilateral gynecomastia. Laboratory work and thyroid uptake scan confirmed diagnosis of Graves’ disease.\n\n【15】It is important to keep a high index of suspicion for thyroid disease as hyperthyroid states may be deceiving in presenting with single organ system involvement.

Gastric variceal bleeding is a life-threatening complication of splenic vein thrombosis, resulting from increased blood flow to short gastric vein. Traditionally, splenectomy is considered the treatment of choice. However, surgery in necrotizing pancreatitis is dangerous, because of severe inflammation, adhesion, and bleeding tendency. In the Warshaw operation, gastric variceal bleeding is rare, even though splenic vein is resected. Because the splenic artery is also resected, blood flow to short gastric vein is not increased problematically. Herein, we report a case of gastric variceal bleeding secondary to splenic vein thrombosis complicated by necrotizing pancreatitis successfully treated with splenic artery embolization. Splenic artery embolization could be the best treatment option for gastric variceal bleeding when splenectomy is difficult such as in case associated with severe acute pancreatitis or associated with severe adhesion or in patients with high operation risk.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) is present in 10~20% of patients with acute pancreatitis. NP should be managed as conservatively as possible because of a high operative mortality. A step-up approach with less invasive management is widely accepted nowadays for management of NP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Bleeding from gastric varices (GVs) secondary to splenic vein thrombosis (SVT) can be life-threatening. GVs secondary to SVT are caused by the imbalance between splenic inflow and outflow. In the setting of SVT, splenic arterial flow is patent, but splenic vein is occluded. Therefore, SVT leads to the increase in splenic outflow via the short gastric and gastroepiploic veins, known as left-sided or sinistral portal hypertension. The increased pressure within the short gastric vein causes submucosal venous dilatation in gastric fundus. It has a potential risk of massive hemorrhage from gastric varices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Traditionally, a splenectomy is considered as a treatment of choice for bleeding GVs secondary to SVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, it is sometimes very difficult and dangerous in the patients with NP because of inflammation, adhesion, and bleeding tendency. In the Warshaw operation—a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with splenic vein resection—the splenic artery and vein are resected with the distal pancreas. The splenic blood flow is preserved through the short gastric vessels and gastroepiploic vessels. In the report about the operative outcome of the Warshaw operation for 23 years, it has been reported that there were no clinical consequences of perigastric varices in 158 patients who underwent the Warshaw operation during a follow-up period of up to 21 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although the splenic vein is resected in this procedure, pressure in short gastric and gastroepiploic vein is not increased problematically, because the splenic artery is also resected. No patient who underwent this procedure needed splenectomy due to bleeding GVs. Therefore, the Warshaw operation is considered safe and feasible. This theory can be applicable to treat gastric varices secondary to SVT.\n\n【5】Some authors have reported that splenic artery embolization (SAE) is an effective alternative to splenectomy for the treatment of gastric variceal bleeding with left-sided portal hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Herein, we report a case of bleeding GVs secondary to SVT in NP, successfully managed by SAE without splenectomy.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【8】A 42-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of a necrotizing pancreatitis. He had no history of medication or alcohol consumption. Laboratory studies revealed white blood cell count 20,200/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin 17.4 g/dL, platelet count 25,8000/mm<sup>3</sup>, serum total bilirubin 2.17 mg/dL, AST 266 U/L, ALT 196 U/L, amylase 1670 U/L, and lipase 2673 U/L. An abdominal CT scan showed acute necrotizing pancreatitis with large amount of peripancreatic necrotic fluid collections . He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and protease inhibitor and empirical antibiotics treatment was initiated. He presented a cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 20 minutes, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and mechanical ventilation were needed for combined multiorgan failure. An abdominal CT scan following 4 weeks of medical treatment in ICU demonstrated a huge pseudocyst . Despite endoscopic transgastric internal drainage and percutaneous drainage, fever and abdominal pain were not subsided. A follow-up abdominal CT scan after 8 weeks from admission revealed the decreased but still remaining large amount of necrotic collections  and SVT with engorgement of perigastric veins . An emergency operation for necrosectomy and external drainage was performed. On operative field, severe adhesion and bleeding tendency was noted. On postoperative day 13, hematemesis occurred. Blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg and hemoglobin decreased from 11.2 g/dL to 7.6 g/dL. An abdominal CT scan revealed extravasation of contrast media at gastric cardia and fundus . After initial resuscitation, an emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. It showed a huge clot in the stomach, and active bleeding from gastric fundus was suspected. However, the focus of bleeding could not be identified exactly due to the presence of large clot and ongoing active bleeding . He was referred to intervention unit and underwent an emergency angiography. Celiac and splenic arteriography revealed no active bleeding from arterial system . Under suspicion of bleeding GVs, SAE was performed using vascular plug . The vascular plug was placed at distal splenic artery just proximal to branching in splenic hilum. After SAE, splenic flow was remarkably decreased . During the procedure, his systolic blood pressure was 70~80 mmHg and heart rate was 140~150 beats per minute. Four packs of PRCs were transfused after SAE. After the procedure, bleeding stopped immediately, and no more episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was observed. An abdominal CT scan 2 days following the SAE showed no more bleeding. A small splenic infarction was seen, but the infarcted volume was less than 10% of total splenic volume . Any treatment for splenic infarction was not needed. At present, 4 months following the SAE, no more episode of variceal bleeding was observed and no infarcted area of spleen was seen on a follow-up abdominal CT scan .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Abdominal CT scan showed severe necrotizing pancreatitis.

Discussion\n\n【14】It is known that incidence of pancreatitis-induced SVT is 14%, and risk of GI bleeding in these patients is 12% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Thrombosed splenic vein with intact splenic artery induces hypertensive short gastric veins that can develop into varices in the gastric fundal submucosa. These varices are a potential source of significant upper GI bleeding . Traditionally, splenectomy is considered as a treatment of choice for GV bleeding secondary to SVT. The cause of bleeding is the imbalance between inflow and outflow of spleen, not a splenic pathology. Therefore, in this setting, rationale for splenectomy is to interrupt the arterial supply feeding the collateral draining veins and the gastric fundus varices, thus reducing the pressure of the system and consequently the risk of rebleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> . The spleen resection should be forced to interrupt the short gastric vessels, because no more blood outflow is present in spleen after ligation of short gastric veins. Therefore, if we can decrease pressure within short gastric veins and no more bleeding is present, splenectomy is not necessary.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 (a) Normal anatomy. The splenic inflows and outflows are balanced. (b) Thrombosed splenic vein and intact splenic artery induces hypertensive short gastric veins. It is a potential source of massive bleeding from gastric varices. (c) The rationale of splenectomy in the setting of gastric variceal bleeding is the complete interruption of blood flow in short gastric veins from spleen.

So, many pancreatic surgeons try to preserve spleen during distal pancreatectomy. The Warshaw operation, spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (SPDP) with splenic vessels resection, is one of options for distal pancreatectomy. In this procedure, the splenic blood flow is preserved by short gastric vessels and left gastroepiploic vessels. Although the splenic vein is resected in this procedure, pressure in short gastric and gastroepiploic vein is not increased problematically, because the splenic artery is also resected . This procedure has a theoretical risk of splenic infarction and perigastric varices. However, many pancreatic surgeons have reported the safety of the Warshaw operation. Warshaw group have reported that none of 158 patients who underwent the Warshaw operation developed GI bleeding and only 3 (1.9%) patients required a reoperation because of splenic infarction during a follow-up period of up to 21 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Kim et al. also have reported no clinical significant splenic infarctions or gastric varices in any case after the Warshaw operation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our center, we performed 19 cases of laparoscopic Warshaw operation from 2014. Splenic infarction was observed in 11 patients; however the infarcted volume was less than 10% in all patients, and no specific treatment was needed. No episode of GI bleeding was observed in all patients.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 (a) After the Warshaw operation, spleen is supplied by short gastric arteries and left gastroepiploic artery and drained by short gastric veins and left gastroepiploic vein. No gastric variceal bleeding was observed after the operation over 20 years of observation period. (b) After splenic artery embolization, pressure within short gastric veins is decreased. The blood flow of spleen is maintained similar to postoperative circumstance of the Warshaw operation. PV, portal vein; SMV, superior mesenteric vein; CV, coronary vein; IMV, inferior mesenteric vein; SA, splenic artery; SV, splenic vein; LGEA, left gastroepiploic artery; LGEV, left gastroepiploic vein; SGA, short gastric artery; SGV, short gastric vein; GVB, gastric variceal bleeding.</u>\n\n【18】On the basis of these clinical results after the Warshaw operation, SAE can be a treatment option for GV bleeding induced by SVT. After SAE, blood pressure in short gastric veins is decreased because the blood inflow to spleen is decreased. In addition, spleen can be preserved via short gastric and gastroepiploic blood supply similar to postoperative circumstance of the Warshaw operation . In our case, after SAE, drainage of fresh blood via nasogastric tube was stopped, and hypovolemic shock and anemia are recovered gradually. And very small region of spleen was infarcted, but no specific treatment was needed. Even though gastric and perigastric varices are still observed on abdominal CT scan, no episode of GI bleeding developed during the 4 months of follow-up period.\n\n【19】Any upper abdominal surgery in the patient with severe acute pancreatitis is very dangerous because of sever adhesion, inflammation, obscure anatomy, friable tissue, and bleeding tendency. Especially in necrotizing pancreatitis, a conservative or less invasive treatment is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Therefore, SAE could be the best treatment modality rather than splenectomy in GVs bleeding secondary to SVT in the patients with NP.\n\n【20】Nonselective SAE, embolization of main trunk of splenic artery, seemed more ideal than selective SAE, embolization of each branch of splenic artery, to preserve left gastroepiploic artery. Stone et al. reported 20~30% volume splenic infarction after nonselective SAE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. By contrast, Sankararaman et al. planned to embolize 80~90% of the spleen. After selective SAE, huge area of spleen was infarcted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In our case, we performed nonselective SAE; then only small portion of spleen was infarcted.\n\n【21】In conclusion, splenic artery embolization is a safe and feasible modality to manage bleeding gastric varices secondary to splenic vein thrombosis. Especially in necrotizing pancreatitis, it could be the best treatment modality in aspect of “step-up” approach. However, more studies are needed with long-term outcome to clarify the necessity of splenectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:59:20", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:03:13", "cost": 232.551}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:03:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:59:20"}

To show the long-term results of intravitreal ranibizumab combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Methods. We analyzed the progress of two patients for 36 and 58 months, respectively. We only used PDT for the treatment in the area of the active PCV or “hot spot” evident on the indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). The spot size was chosen so as to cover only the active neovascular lesion. We combined intravitreal ranibizumab with PDT when PCV remained active without visible polyps in ICGA or without a response to PDT. Conclusion. Administration, as required, of verteporfin photodynamic therapy combined with intravitreal ranibizumab is an effective treatment for symptomatic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. These data need to be confirmed in large, prospective, and controlled clinical trials which are randomized and carried out over a long period.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of visual loss in the elderly population in industrial countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Exudative AMD is subcategorized into three phenotypes: typical AMD, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and retinal angiomatous proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> but doubt still exists as to whether PVC is a distinct entity or a variant of neovascular AMD and other neovascularized maculopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】PCV is characterized by choroidal vascular networks with polyp-like aneurysmal dilations which are most clearly identified by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are useful diagnostic tools 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In OCT, PCV is characterized by a higher incidence of retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED), subretinal fluid, and less intraretinal fluid than eyes with exudative AMD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. PCV lesions appear as occult or minimally classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with FA, while ICGA clearly demonstrates the poly-like vascular network within the choroid. ICGA is the gold standard for the ultimate confirmation of PCV and it shows that the abnormal vasculature consists of a branching vascular network (BVN) and polypoidal lesions. Therefore, ICGA is the best way to diagnose PCV and to identify active components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The visual prognosis of PVC has been reported to be better than that of exudative AMD, and a conservative approach is recommended, unless the lesion is associated with persistent or progressive exudative change that threatens central vision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, subretinal fibrosis and RPE atrophy can cause significant and permanent vision loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Moreover, the incidence of sub-RPE hemorrhage or subretinal hemorrhage in patients with PVC is high (30%–64%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Controversy continues over the best way to manage active forms.\n\n【6】Among the currently available treatment modalities for PCV, verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems the most promising 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, with complete regression of polyps in 73% to 99% of the patients and stabilizing or improving visual acuity (81%–100%) with typically fewer than 3 treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. After PDT, the polyps are occluded, and exudative lesions are resolved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. Numerous reports describe the effectiveness of PDT for occluding polypoidal lesions and resolving the associated exudative changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. However, PDT does not occlude the BVN. Future recurrence is inevitable as new polyps form from the remaining BVN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Furthermore, a persistent BVN may leak in some cases, or PDT may induce the evolution of the BVN into CNV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14–16\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The polyps tend to recur, requiring frequent retreatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>, and in these patients, PDT can cause serious complications, including massive macular hemorrhage, ischemia, or atrophy. Choroidal ischemia consecutively induces a secondary angiogenic response with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Anti-VEGF therapy is another treatment modality that is being investigated in PCV. Data available so far has indicated that anti-VEGF agents alone may not be effective for complete regression of polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Compared with choroidal neovascularization seen in AMD, the vascular changes associated with PCV are more structured and mature, and this might explain their limited response to standard anti-VEGF therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【10】To achieve complete regression of the polypoidal lesions, while maximizing the visual outcome, combination therapy using PDT and anti-VEGF agents may be useful, rather than performing anti-VEGF monotherapy alone, as the former can combine the actions of angioocclusion and antiangiogenesis.\n\n【11】Ranibizumab is a humanized, antigen-binding fragment (Fab) with low molecular weight (48 kDa) that targets all VEGF-A isoforms and their biologically active degradation products 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Ranibizumab has a lower molecular weight and increased binding affinity for all forms of VEGF compared with bevacizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16, 19\\]</u>. Therefore, it is assumed to be more effective for treating PCV than is bevacizumab. Our choice of ranibizumab for intravitreal therapy was motivated by the fact that it is a relatively small molecule, which is more likely to reach the subretinal space where the polyps are located.\n\n【12】We analyzed the long-term results in two patients with PVC who underwent PDT and intravitreal ranibizumab. We reviewed the visual acuity, OCT, FA, and ICGA changes.\n\n【13】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【14】A retrospective review was performed to examine the medical records and angiographic data of 2 patients who were diagnosed with active PVC at the Gomez-Ulla Institute of Ophthalmology and the Department of Ophthalmology, Santiago de Compostela University Hospital. These patients were treated, as required, with PDT and intravitreal ranibizumab injections during 36 and 58 months of followup, respectively. The risk and benefits of PDT using verteporfin and alternative methods of treatment were described to the patients, who gave their consent to treatment.\n\n【15】Pertinent history, including age, sex, race, medical history, and previous treatments as well as clinical parameters (diagnosis, duration of macular exudation), was recorded.\n\n【16】The diagnosis of PCV was based on the finding of characteristic poly-like choroidal vessel dilation, with or without a BVN, on ICGA using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retina Angiograph 2 (HRA2); Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) or Topcon-IMAGEnet (Topcon corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), funduscopy, OCT, fundus photography, FA, and ICGA were performed on each patient before treatment. At each visit, the patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination including BCVA, intraocular pressure measurement, indirect ophthalmoscopy, slip-lamp biomicroscopy with a contact lens, fundus photography, and OCT. Additional angiographies were performed as necessary.\n\n【17】BCVA was measured using Snellen charts. Firstly we used the stratus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc. Dublin, CA), and then cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc. Dublin, CA) was used at the baseline examination and at the follow-up visits. FA and fundus photography were performed on each patient using a Heidelberg Retinal Angiograph-2 (HRA-2; Heidelberg Engineering GmBH, Dossenheim, Germany) or a Topcon IMAGEnet (Topcon corporation, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n【18】The intravitreal administration of 0.5 mgr/0.05 mL of ranibizumab (Lucentis; Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) was performed 3 times at 1-month intervals, and a standard PDT was performed using 689 nm diode laser system (Coherent Inc. Santa Clara, CA) after intravenous injection of verteporfin (Visudyne; Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland). PDT with verteporfin was applied using the same parameters as for the treatment of neovascular AMD in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration with photodynamic therapy study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Greatest linear dimension (GLD) was calculated based on ICGA, covering dilated polyps. Only the area of the active PCV or “hot spot” evident on the angiogram was treated. A spot size which would cover the active neovascular lesion was chosen. Retreatment was performed when ICGA showed active polypoidal lesions. The intravitreal administration of ranibizumab was considered when OCT showed persistent or new exudative change, including intraretinal edema or subretinal fluid in PVC with polyp lesions which were unresponsive to the treatments, or without polyps using ICGA, or when the polypoidal lesions persisted after treatments.\n\n【20】The treatment end point was achieved when there was a complete absence of exudative change on OCT.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Case Reports\n\n【22】##### 3.1. Case  1\n\n【23】A 54-year-old man attended a consultation regarding reduction of visual acuity (VA) in the left eye. He had received treatment with PDT for the same eye three years previously and had been stable up to the time of the consultation. At baseline, the BCVA was 20/50. FA showed occult CNV, and stratus OCT displayed subretinal fluid and changes to the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) in the level of the fovea . The patient was treated with three monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Six months later, the BCVA was 20/40, and the FA showed an occult NVC and persistent changes in the OCT. An ICGA was performed and it revealed characteristics of typical subfoveal polypoidal lesions, and so it was decided to start treatment with PDT .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Stratus OCT shows a subretinal lesion with steep dome-like elevation suggestive of an active polyp with associated subfoveal neurosensory detachment (subretinal fluid).

Three months later, the BCVA was 20/20, and OCT did not show any exudative changes in the macula . The patient remained stable for 42 months with a BCVA of 20/20 and without fluid in the stratus OCT . Forty-five months after the onset of symptoms, the patient reported a loss of visual acuity (20/30) and he presented a neurosensory detachment of the fovea in the OCT, and it was therefore decided to repeat the FA and the ICGA. No polyps were observed in the ICGA, and so in view of the loss of VA and evidence of fluid in the cirrus HD-OCT , treatment of 3 monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab was carried out. However, visual acuity decreased to 20/50 in spite of the injections, and changes in the cirrus HD-OCT worsened rather than disappeared. Six months after the unsuccessful treatment, a further angiography confirmed a recurrence of polypoidal lesions in the eye , indicating the need for another PDT session on the polyps. Then, 3 months after the second PDT, the polyps on the ICGA disappeared. In contrast, the exudative changes to the pigmentary epithelium of the retina in cirrus HD-OCT continued and suggested the persistence of NVC . The AV was maintained at 20/40, and it was decided to monitor the patient progress given his poor response to the antiangiogenic treatment.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Three months later of the PDT treatment, the BCVA improved to 20/20 and stratus OCT did not show any exudative changes in the macula. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | The patient remained stable for 42 months with a BCVA of 20/20 and without fluid in the stratus OCT. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | Forty-five months after the onset of symptoms, the patient reported a loss of visual acuity (20/30) and he presented a neurosensory detachment of the fovea in the cirrus HD-OCT (a), and it was therefore decided to repeat the FA and the ICGA.

Case  2\n\n【35】A 65-year-old woman comes to urgencies for unilateral visual impairment and metamorphopsia in the right eye, dating from a month prior to her visit. The BCVA was 20/40, and at the fundus eye, a hemorrhagic detachment was observed with hard exudates at the macular level. She was referred to the Medical Retina Unit with a suspected diagnosis of PVC.\n\n【36】FA showed a pigment epithelial detachment (PED) with a subretinal hemorrhage. Stratus OCT confirmed PED, and only a single juxtapapilary polypoidal lesion was observed with ICGA . We decided to perform a PDT session on the polyp (spot size 1100 microns). Three months later, the BCVA was 20/80, and although the condition of the fundus eye had improved, there was a great PED with persistence of the polypoid lesion in the ICGA, which led to a new PDT session on the polyp (spot size 1500 microns) .

Results and Discussion\n\n【44】Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy is a clinical entity that is being diagnosed with increasing frequency because of improved imaging devices such as ICG angiography and OCT. Controversy continues over the way to manage active forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【45】Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin has been the treatment of choice, especially in PVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 14, 21–24\\]</u>. Visual acuity is maintained or improved in 80% to 95% of patients. Some studies suggest that PDT resolves PCV lesions in less than 3 treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>, but last studies with a long followup describes frequent recurrences after PDT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 25\\]</u>. There is evidence that the PDT occludes the polyps but sometimes its tends to recur. The one major concern regarding the efficacy of PDT for PCV is the recurrence or the development of a new polypoidal lesion with longer followup. In some cases, the PDT cannot occlude the polyp properly but in other cases, the persistent branching vessels in the network may be origins of new active polypoidal lesions.\n\n【46】Periodical ICGA would be needed to detect abnormal choroidal vascular changes during long-term followup after PDT and in order to determine whether persistent or recurrent lesions are associated with polyps or BVN.\n\n【47】Although recurrence and retreatment do not seem to decrease BCVA further, some authors of previous reports agree on the need for studies with longer follow-up times to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PDT treatment of PCV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. PDT may alter the natural progression of the polypoidal CNV as a result of ischemia and increased VEGF expression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. After the introduction of anti-VEGF agents, several studies reported the efficacy of PDT with anti-VEGF treatment for PVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27–29\\]</u>as well as reporting on the way to minimize the complications related to the use of PDT and the need to use selective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> or reduced fluence PDT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【48】Some studies suggest that high fluences could produce ischemia and stimulate VEGF production. Therefore, we speculate that the smaller spot or half the dose of fluence could be better because of reduced size. It is important because PDT may alter the natural progression of PCV in narrow sense, causing enlargement or a change to polypoidal CNV as a result of ischemia and increased VEGF expression.\n\n【49】In our study, the first patient did not initially respond well to ranibizumab on its own, but there appears to be a consensus that, in contrast to neovascular age-related macular degeneration, anti-VEGF monotherapy has shown limited effectiveness in patients with PVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy has been shown to stabilize vision for a short period, reducing exudative changes, but it has shown little effect on choroidal vascular abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31, 32\\]</u>. With a single PDT treatment, after the 3 intravitreal ranibizumab injections, the patient was stable for 42 months, with a BCVA of 20/20 and without fluid in the OCT image. We do not know if the antiangiogenic treatment associated with the PDT could have contributed to the positive results in the long-term followup in this case. The Everest Study showed that the disappearance rate of polypoidal lesions on ICGA was significantly better with PDT alone, and PDT plus ranibizumab, than with ranibizumab monotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【50】It appears that the PDT on its own produces better results as regards occlusion of polypoid lesions. However, PDT plus ranibizumab could be useful for cases such as incomplete closure of active polypoid lesions, as in case 2, persistent exudative phenomena, or a finer branching vascular network. In these situations, the combination proved to be effective in preventing further visual deterioration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Our patients maintained very good levels of visual acuity during a relatively long followup. We believe that the use of smaller spots could minimize the risks and side effects of PDT, and attempts to minimize these risks include a modified PDT protocol characterized by focusing the spot only on the polyps visible in ICGA, as if the PDT is not going to have an effect on the BVN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26, 33\\]</u>. Moreover, the reduced number of PDTs might have been one of the reasons for the good visual outcome.When there are no visible polyps, the only option is treatment with anti-VEGF therapy, but if the patient does not respond, continuing does not appear to be justified. This was the case with patient 1, who appears to have a certain amount of resistance to ranibizumab.\n\n【51】We speculate that administration of VEGF antagonist for PVC, in conjunction with PDT, might minimize the adverse effects of PDT, as well as decrease the number of PDT treatments required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. During the long-term followup of our patients, we found a good visual acuity, perhaps due to the fact that the small size of the spot might produce less foveal atrophy and also due to the associated benefits of the anti VEGF treatment.\n\n【52】The combination of PDT and ranibizumab appears to be beneficial in prolonging the period before recurrence of polyps, as well as in maintaining good visual acuity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. The controversy continues, however, as we do not know the best way in which to combine them. Perhaps we need an individualized treatment, which will allow us to decide on the best choice to use them in each case. In our opinion, identification of PCV susceptibility genes represents a fundamental step to personalized therapy for this disease.\n\n【53】The use of combined PDT and intravitreal ranibizumab injections should be further evaluated in longer-term studies in order to determine if their synergistic effects will be useful in improving the long-term treatment outcome for PVC.\n\n【54】Our study was limited by its retrospective nature and by the number of patients.\n\n【55】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【56】Administration, as required, of verteporfin photodynamic therapy combined with intravitreal ranibizumab is an effective treatment for symptomatic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.\n\n【57】These data need to be confirmed in large, prospective, and controlled clinical trials which are randomized and carried out over a long period.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:11:17", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:11:37", "cost": 20.59}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:11:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:11:16"}

The diagnosis is challenging due to the rarity, nonspecific symptoms, and absence of the alarmingly high blood glucose levels, and thus, it could be initially missed resulting in delayed treatment. This is particularly important for sedated patients, as the absence of typical clinical signs and symptoms can obscure the diagnosis. We present the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus on empagliflozin who developed EDKA while sedated after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) despite stopping the medication 24 hours prior to surgery. We also summarize the current literature on EDKA after CABG. Physicians must be aware and maintain a high index of suspicion for the illness, especially in patients with T2DM taking SGLT-2i and undergoing a major operation such as CABG. Emergent treatment and multidisciplinary follow-up are needed to improve patient outcomes and mitigate complications. Physicians should also consider identifying the optimal time to discontinue SGLT-2i before major surgeries and possible ketone studies in such patients, especially those sedated following the surgery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most serious complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). It is characterized by hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.3 and serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/L), and ketosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This complication typically develops in patients with type 1 DM and, to a lesser extent, type 2 DM (T2DM). It is commonly associated with stress, such as that associated with major surgery or infection. Rarely, these patients could present with a relatively lower blood glucose (BG) level (<250 mg/dL), which is referred to as “euglycemic” DKA (EDKA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although it is rare, this entity has been described in the literature. In fact, it was reported that approximately 2.6%–3.2% of all DKA admissions are euglycemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Among different associated factors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) (i.e. gliflozins) are believed to be linked to EDKA, with rates ranging from 0.16 to 0.76 events per 1000 patient-years in patients with T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. This rare variant of DKA poses a challenging diagnosis for physicians as patients with normal or near-normal BG levels may be initially overlooked resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can be fatal. EDKA related to SGLT-2i is important to consider in diabetic patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The use of SGLT-2i has become more common in this population after data suggesting a mortality benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. T2DM patients with cardiac diseases taking gliflozins are prone to experience many stressors, especially when complicated with an acute CVD event (e.g. myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbation, and cardiac surgeries), which can further increase their chances of getting gliflozin-induced EDKA. In the same context, we present a case of a T2DM patient on SGLT-2i who developed EDKA, while sedated, after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Moreover, we sought to conduct a literature search on EDKA after CABG to shed the light and attract the attention of the medical community to this rising issue.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 52-year-old male, with the past medical history significant for T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease (IHD), presented to the cardiology clinic complaining of recurrent chest pain. He has had chest pain for a long period of time, which was getting more severe one week prior to hospital admission. He denied any history of smoking, illicit drug use, or alcohol consumption. At that time, his physical examination was unremarkable. He was on vildagliptin-metformin (50/1000 mg), empagliflozin (10 mg), pioglitazone (30 mg), irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (300/12.5 mg), atorvastatin (20 mg), and aspirin; however, he was not compliant, which was associated with poorly controlled blood pressure and glucose levels. His laboratory results  were within normal limits, except for abnormal HbA1c (10.24%) and lipid profile. His ECG showed sinus tachycardia with no acute ischemic changes. Echocardiography showed an ejection fraction (EF) of >50% with no wall motion abnormalities. CT coronaries showed 70% stenosis at the left main coronary artery. Due to these findings, the patient was advised to undergo diagnostic coronary angiography which revealed triple vessel disease. After thorough discussion between the patient, cardiology, and cardiac surgery physicians, the decision was made to operate on the patient with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Owing to his critical lesions, the patient was admitted and closely monitored until the day of surgery. At that time, he was started on insulin sliding scale. Additionally, metformin-vildagliptin was held before coronary angiography, while the other medications, including empagliflozin, were continued until 24 hours prior to the surgery. His laboratory results were normal , except for high fasting glucose. He was fasting for a total of 8 hours before the surgery.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Blood tests of our patient at 5 different occasions.</u>\n\n【8】The patient underwent grafting of the diseased vessels. The patient tolerated the surgery well, came off the cardiopulmonary bypass without difficulties, and did not need inotropic support. He was shifted to the ICU in a stable condition. On the same day, the patient was sedated on mechanical ventilation. Initially, he was clinically and vitally stable on minimal noradrenaline dose with no oozing from drain sites. Six hours after leaving the OR, his arterial blood gases (ABG) showed anion gap metabolic acidosis, with high lactate (3.3 mmol/L), that was resistant to IV fluid boluses. At that time, although his random blood glucose measures were ranging between 145 and 188 mg/dL, he had a blood pH of 7.225, with markedly decreased HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> (14.60 mmol/L) and an anion gap of 17.40, consistent with moderate DKA. Urinalysis showed 3+ ketones . Therefore, the decision was made to follow the DKA protocol for management in addition to closely monitoring his electrolytes and blood glucose levels. As soon as DKA was detected, he was started on IV fluids and insulin infusion. For fluids, he was given 1000 cc bolus of Ringer’s Lactate followed by ½ Normal Saline (NS) at a rate of 150 cc/hour for one hour. Then, the patient was transitioned to Dextrose 5% ½ NS (150 cc/hour). After a few hours, the rate was decreased to 100 cc/hour. The next day, he was transitioned to 0.9% NS (70 cc/hour). The patient was kept on insulin for 12 hours from the time of EDKA diagnosis. Hours after treatment, the patient began to improve . His pH normalized, and his K+ level went down to 3.7 mmol/L. Urine ketones went from 3+ to 1+.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 ABG and urinalysis of our patient at 4 different occasions.</u>\n\n【10】On the following day, the patient was awake and oriented. He did not have any active complaints. He was clinically and vitally stable. He received two units of packed RBCs due to his low hemoglobin (7.40 g/dL). His ABG normalized with a blood pH of 7.418, K+ of 3.90 mmol/L and an HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> level of 23.3 mmol/L. At that time, his urinalysis was negative for ketone bodies. The next day, the patient was shifted to the cardiology floor with improving overall health status and hemoglobin level. He has had an uneventful hospital course for 8 days during which he was steadily improving. Subsequently, the patient was discharged home in a stable condition with appropriate follow-up appointments.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】The diagnosis of EDKA is challenging for several reasons. The fact that EDKA is rare, and more so in patients with T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, the nonspecific symptoms of the illness, and the absence of alarmingly high BG levels (i.e. >250) are all contributing factors that allow the diagnosis to be easily missed. The rarity of such an illness could be due to underdiagnosis, underreporting, and more likely, due to true rarity in occurrence. The recent possible role that SGLT-2i may play in the development of EDKA has encouraged physicians and researchers alike to uncover novel information regarding the incidence and underlying mechanism of the illness associated with these agents.\n\n【13】SGLT-2i are a new class of antidiabetic medications that lower BG levels by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules. It is suggested that SGLT-2i can lead to EDKA by decreasing BG levels, which leads to a reduction in insulin secretion and consequent rise in glucagon. In addition, SGLT-2i can directly stimulate glucagon production. As a result of low insulin and high glucagon levels, ketogenesis will be activated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. One study estimates a 7-fold increase in DKA in patients with T2DM due to SGLT-2 inhibitor use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, not all of these cases were euglycemic.\n\n【14】SGLT-2i have demonstrated cardioprotective effects and reduction in cardiovascular negative outcomes making them an excellent choice for patients with diabetes and CVD, such as our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The benefits of SGLT-2i in such patients must be outweighed against the risks of adverse effects, especially in times of stress (i.e. CABG), and the current recommendations suggest the omission of SGLT-2i dose one day before surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Nevertheless, there have been cases described of perioperative EDKA in patients who have had these medications omitted for up to 48 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In accordance with the current recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, empagliflozin was omitted 24 hours before our patient’s surgery, yet he still developed EDKA postoperatively. The time since the medication is held prior to surgery is an important factor to consider, due to two main reasons: the absence of the offending agent (i.e. gliflozin use) and the patient being put on insulin. Being on insulin for a greater period of time (e.g. >48 hours) is theoretically expected to decrease the chances of gliflozin-induced EDKA. The suggested hypothesis is related to low blood insulin levels and resultant switch of glucose to fat metabolism and subsequent development of ketosis and ketoacidosis. This is of important relevance in patients taking SGLT-2i, as they were most likely put on the medication due to its positive glycemic and cardioprotective effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Moreover, the fasting state prior to surgery presents its own added risk to developing EDKA, perhaps due to increased ketogenesis during periods of starvation, adding another factor that can possibly lead to, or exacerbate, this patient’s condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In addition to highlighting the relationship between the offending agent (SGLT-2i) and the population at risk, it is worth focusing on the parts of the story that made the diagnosis challenging. In our case, the diagnosis of EDKA was not easy since the patient was sedated after CABG; thus, the common clinical presentation of DKA (abdominal pain, polyuria, excessive thirst, nausea, and vomiting) could not be appreciated, unlike other cases wherein patients were awake, oriented, and had typical symptoms of DKA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 12\\]</u>. Additionally, his blood glucose levels postoperatively were well below 200 mg/dL; thus, it could have discouraged the caring physician to initiate continuous insulin infusion, which is the usual practice in most of the critically-ill or post-major surgery patients with diabetes. The ABG that showed anion gap metabolic acidosis that is resistant to IV fluids prompted further workup, wherein ketonuria was detected. Supplementary Figure 1 represents the connection between T2DM, SGLT-2I, and major stressors with EDKA development.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Review of the Literature\n\n【17】To better evaluate EDKA after CABG, we performed a literature search on PubMed (19 April 2021) using the following search string: ((Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis) AND (coronary artery bypass surgery)) without time restrictions, in addition to carefully assessing the references of certain EDKA articles for possible matches. Out of 67 PubMed articles, 5 articles were retrieved that reported on a total of 7 patients and were published between 2018 and 2021. Table 3 summarizes the reported cases of EDKA after CABG in the literature. Interestingly, our search string did not include any keywords related to SGLT-2i; however, all the retrieved articles had SGLT-2i use in common. The time since gliflozin was held preoperatively was reported to be within 1 day prior to surgery in most of the cases; however, it was still possible for patients to develop EDKA when withholding the medication was carried out 42 and 48 hours before CABG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 16\\]</u>. Moreover, most of the patients showed some signs and symptoms that usually accompany DKA, unlike our patient. Serum lactate was normal in the majority of cases, and even the patients who have had high serum lactate (e.g. 2.24, 2.8) did not reach to a clear cutoff level that is equivalent to lactic acidosis (serum lactate >5.0 mmol/L) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Moreover, the time between CABG and EDKA development can extend up to a few days, as Zhand and Tamilia reported about their patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Of note, one article reported on a patient with EDKA after CABG who was on SGLT-2i that was held for >24 hours prior to surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>; however, this article was not included in our table since it is in Japanese and, thus, could not be thoroughly analyzed.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 Reported cases of EDKA after CABG.</u>\n\n【19】Based on the current evidence, physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for EDKA when dealing with cardiac patients on SGLT-2i, especially when these patients are to experience periods of excessive stress. This may be due to the absence of the easy and quick screening measure of typical hyperglycemia and the absence of clinical symptoms, especially in sedated patients. Patients with EDKA need immediate referral for emergency evaluation and management. The treatment includes addressing the underlying etiology, correction of dehydration with intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and the use of insulin and dextrose infusions until the anion gap and bicarbonate levels normalize 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The correct diagnosis in our patient was made mainly through laboratory investigations; prompt EDKA treatment protocol ensued that resulted in improvement of our patient’s clinical status and outcome.\n\n【20】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【21】Patients with T2DM and CVD are recommended to be on SGLT-2i due to their positive CV benefits; however, these patients may also be considered having a higher risk for developing EDKA following an acute cardiac or other stressful event. Our case does not underestimate the importance of SGLT-2i use in cases where they are clearly indicated, but rather, it shows a potential side effect that can be avoided.\n\n【22】In conclusion, physicians should be aware and maintain a high index of suspicion for EDKA in patients taking SGLT-2i that have recently experienced high levels of stress (i.e. CABG). The diagnosis is challenging due to the rarity, nonspecific symptoms, and absence of high BG levels. Moreover, it is more challenging to make the diagnosis in sedated patients as the typical clinical presentation may be masked. Emergent treatment and multidisciplinary follow-up are needed to improve patient outcomes and mitigate complications. More studies on bigger scales are required to better understand the prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of this condition. Future guidelines should consider identifying the optimal time to discontinue SGLT-2i prior to a major surgery. In addition, we suggest routine urine ketone check in patients on SGLT-2i after CABG due to the seriousness of this condition, and the cost effectiveness of urine ketones makes them an excellent choice as a possible screening tool for such patients. An effort within the medical community must be put forth in future studies to merge and review similar cases to uncover more information that will help guide clinicians in EDKA prevention, detection, and treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:01:35", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:02:51", "cost": 75.095}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:02:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:01:35"}

Successful management of the disease is challenging especially if diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, but not impossible with the current therapeutic choices for the disease. A vast array of treatment modalities is available which can be employed in the treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis with varying success rates, but a definite guideline for the management is yet to be formulated. However, with the exponential rate of developments in periodontal research, regenerative therapy, tissue engineering, and genetic technologies, the future seems promising in regard to options at managing the disease. This paper attempts to describe the clinical and radiographic diagnostic features and the current treatment options along with a suggested protocol for comprehensive management of generalized aggressive periodontitis patients with case reports and a brief review.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Aggressive periodontitis, as the name implies is a type of periodontitis where there is rapid destruction of periodontal ligament and alveolar bone which occurs in otherwise systemically healthy individuals generally of a younger age group but patients may be older 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Although its prevalence has been reported to be much less than that of chronic periodontitis, it can result in early tooth loss in the affected individuals if not diagnosed in the early stages and treated appropriately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The disease is generally found to have a racial and sex predilection, with blacks and male teenagers having higher risk for the disease compared to whites and females, although reports vary between different ethnic groups and populations, with some populations showing prevalence as high as 28.8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Aggressive periodontitis, first described in 1923 as “diffuse atrophy of the alveolar bone” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, has undergone a series of terminology changes over the years to be finally named as “aggressive periodontitis” in 1999 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. The disease which includes both localized and generalized forms was previously known as “early onset periodontitis” which included the three categories of periodontitis—prepubertal, juvenile, and rapidly progressing periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. It is interesting that the first ever reported detailed description of a recognized disease in early hominid evolution is a case of prepubertal periodontitis in an 2.5–3-million-year-old fossil remains of a juvenile Australopithecus africanus specimen which showed the typical pattern of alveolar bone destruction with migration of the affected deciduous molars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) is characterized by “generalized interproximal attachment loss affecting at least 3 permanent teeth other than first molars and incisors” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is a multifactorial disease where interplay of microbiologic, genetic, immunologic, and environmental/behavioral risk factors decides the onset, course, and severity. Pathogenic bacteria in the dental plaque especially Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u> have an indispensable role which elicits an aggravated host response which in turn is determined by the genetic and immunologic profile of the patient modified by environmental risk factors like smoking.\n\n【6】This paper attempts to describe the diagnostic features along with the periodontal management options of generalized aggressive periodontitis with the help of case reports with different clinical presentation and patterns of involvement and managed with different treatment modalities available. Finally an attempt to summarize the available protocol for a comprehensive management of GAgP is done which can serve as a guideline till more definite clear-cut guidelines are established for the disease in the future.\n\n【7】#### 2\\.

(b) and (c) Deep pockets revealed by probing in a periodontium with lack of clinical inflammation. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【10】Patients may complain of halitosis and pus discharge from gums. Mobility of the affected teeth will be seen towards the later stages of the infection. Patients will be otherwise systemically healthy. Severe pain is rarely experienced by the patients except in situations where a periodontal abscess develops or a periodontal-endodontic infection occurs via accessory canals or tooth apex. Some patients may complain of a dull nagging type of pain from gums. Gingival recession may be seen and patients may complain of food impaction due to loss of contact points between teeth.\n\n【11】GAgP patients who smoke and/or maintain a poor oral hygiene demonstrate more severe destruction of periodontium compared to those who do not smoke or maintain a satisfactory oral hygiene .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | (a)–(d) Clinical and radiographic appearance of GAgP in a 25-year-old smoker with poor oral hygiene. (e) A 19-year-old smoker with GAgP demonstrating severe periodontal destruction. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【13】The disease progresses in alternating periods of activity and quiescence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. This leads to two types of presentation at the time of examination. In the periods of quiescence, patients are free of symptoms and the gingiva appears pink and healthy even though probing reveals deep periodontal pockets. Lack of visible signs of clinical inflammation despite the presence of deep periodontal pockets and severe attachment loss in an otherwise healthy young individual is the classic sign of aggressive periodontitis presenting at this stage . Probing should be done with calibrated periodontal probes at six sites around each tooth.\n\n【14】The periods of inactivity may remain for weeks to months or even years and will be followed by periods of active disease. During this period, there will be active bone destruction and attachment loss. When the patient presents in this stage, the gingiva will show all signs of mild to severe inflammation. Gingiva may be tender, fiery red, edematous, soft, and boggy. Bleeding on probing or even spontaneous bleeding and purulent exudation may be evident. Inflammatory gingival enlargement may also be noticed. The majority of the patients refer to dental consultation at this stage of the disease .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | (a)–(c) Features of severe gingival inflammation presented at the stage of active disease. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【16】This stage may undergo spontaneous remission after a varying period of destruction and the inflammatory symptoms subside to reappear after a period of quiescence. Advanced stages of the untreated disease with severe periodontal destruction may show extrusion of teeth, mobility and pathologic migration, furcation involvement, generalized gingival recession, and loss of several teeth due to spontaneous exfoliation. Some patients may show systemic manifestations such as weight loss, mental depression and general malaise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Radiographic Features\n\n【18】Localized aggressive periodontitis typically presents “arc-shaped” mirror image radiolucency in the first molars starting from the distal aspect of second premolars to the mesial aspect of the second molar. In generalized aggressive periodontitis, radiographs may show generalized bone destruction ranging from mild crestal bone resorption to severe extensive alveolar bone destruction depending on the severity of the disease. The defects may be a combination of vertical and horizontal defects .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | (a) Arc-shaped radiolucency at the 1st molar region in localized aggressive periodontitis. (b) Generalized distribution of bone loss seen in GAgP with vertical defects. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Diagnosis\n\n【21】Early diagnosis is of utmost importance for the prevention of extensive attachment loss and bone loss experienced in aggressive periodontitis. Diagnosis is made according to the criteria set by the American Academy of periodontology, 1999 classification of periodontal diseases and conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, using history, clinical features, and radiographic features aided by microbial examination if needed. Family history may reveal a history of early tooth loss in the parents or immediate blood relatives of the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The amount of microbial deposits will be inconsistent with the amount of destruction when compared to chronic periodontitis and plaque will be minimal. Comparison of serial radiographs helps in assessing the rapid rate of bone destruction and can aid in the diagnosis of the disease.\n\n【22】#### 5\\. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【23】Aggressive periodontitis can be differentiated from chronic periodontitis by the age of onset, rapid rate of disease progression, the nature and composition of the associated subgingival microflora, alterations in host immune response, and a familial aggregation of the diseased individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Systemic diseases like hematologic disorders and some genetic disorders also show periodontitis as a manifestation mimicking generalized aggressive periodontitis which can be ruled out by assessing the systemic status, hematologic data analysis, and immunologic profiling of the patient. In addition, there are rare reports of certain conditions like intraosseous sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>, eosinophilic granuloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u> and alveolar bone actinomycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>, presenting with extensive alveolar bone destruction like in aggressive periodontitis which can be differentiated by biopsy of the suspected lesions.\n\n【24】#### 6\\. Case Reports\n\n【25】##### 6.1. Case Report 1\n\n【26】A 32-year-old female patient presented with the complaint of a recently noticed spacing between the upper front teeth.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | (a)–(d) Deep pockets were present even though signs of gingival inflammation other than bleeding on probing were absent. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【28】The patient noticed the spacing about 1 year before, after which she noticed it to be gradually increasing and associated with intermittent episodes of pus discharge which subsided on taking antibiotics as per advice at a local hospital. There were no associated complaints other than a cosmetic concern from the patient. There was no history of any previous dental treatment. Family history of similar complaints or early tooth loss could not be elicited. The patient was systemically healthy with no relevant medical history.\n\n【29】There were no abnormalities detected in extra oral examination except for a slightly tender and palpable left submandibular lymph node. Full complement of teeth was present. The oral hygiene status of the patient was good as revealed by the oral hygiene index. There was minimal amount of calculus and plaque. There was grade I mobility of 22, 31, 32, 21 and 22. Proximal contacts were lost between the teeth 14 and 13, 13 and 12, 21 and 22 and 22 and 23, 22 and 24 and between lower anterior teeth. There was labial migration and flaring of upper and lower anterior teeth with an evident distolabial migration of 22.\n\n【30】Gingival examination revealed normal color except for the labial aspect of 22 where it was slightly reddish. The margins were of knife-edge contour except for the labial aspect of 22 and 42 where it was bluntly rounded. The gingiva was firm and resilient except in the region on 22 where it was soft in consistency. There was no loss of stippling in the anterior regions. The position of the gingival margin was apical to the CEJ in the labial aspect of 22. There was generalized bleeding on probing, and exudation was present on the labial aspect of 22. All together there were minimal signs of inflammation other than bleeding on probing.\n\n【31】A full-mouth periodontal charting revealed generalized periodontal pockets and clinical attachment loss .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 | Periodontal charting showing generalized deep pockets and clinical attachment loss. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【33】Pockets were especially deeper in the molar and incisor regions with slightly lesser involvement in the premolar region. The clinical attachment loss ranged from a maximum of 10 mm in the midpalatal aspect of 16 to a minimum of 2 mm in the premolar regions.\n\n【34】An OPG and full-mouth IOPA X-ray were performed which revealed the generalized distribution of alveolar bone loss which was a combination of both horizontal and vertical bone loss . Routine blood examination results were within normal limits.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 | Orthopantomogram of the patient demonstrating generalized distribution of bone loss. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【36】Based on the history, examination findings, and the radiographic findings, a diagnosis of generalized aggressive periodontitis was made according to the criteria by AAP 1999 classification.\n\n【37】##### 6.2. Management\n\n【38】A thorough supragingival scaling was performed following which the patient was motivated for better plaque control. A sulcus brushing technique (modified Bass technique) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> was demonstrated, and the patient was educated on the use of interdental cleansing aids including dental floss and interdental brushes. Chlorhexidine mouth wash was prescribed to further aid in plaque control. Systemic antibiotics (Amoxycillin and Metronidazole, 250 mg of each thrice daily) were prescribed for 8 days, and the patient was recalled after 2 weeks for evaluation of the response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【39】A subgingival scaling was performed after which the patient was advised to continue the chlorhexidine mouthwashes. A reevaluation 2 weeks after subgingival scaling showed a reduction in probing depths and absence of bleeding on probing.\n\n【40】A quadrant-wise full-mouth flap surgery was performed including bone grafting in relation to the molar regions where predominantly vertical or intrabony defects were detected. A modified Widman flap surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> in conjunction with bone replacement graft was performed in the molar regions  whereas a sulcular incision flap (Kirkland flap) was performed in the maxillary and mandibular anterior region to minimize the recession after healing for esthetic purposes.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8 | (a)–(e) Modified Widman flap in conjunction with bone grafting performed. (f) Postoperative evaluation showing probing depth within normal limits. (g) 6-Month postoperative intraoral periapical radiographs. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【42】A preprocedural rinse with antimicrobial agent was done to minimize the bacterial count in the mouth. After adequately anesthetizing the surgical site with infiltration anesthesia and nerve blocks, the first incision (internal bevel incision) 0.5 mm from the gingival margin directing to the crest of the alveolar bone was made. The flap was reflected following which sulcular incision and interdental incision were made to remove the wedge of tissue. Curettage for granulation tissue removal was done following which a through subgingival debridement and root planning was performed. The defect was irrigated with normal saline, and a root conditioning with tetracycline was performed. The graft was a xenograft (Bovine graft—Ossopan), which was mixed with the blood from the surgical site and placed into the defect after presuturing the site with silk sutures. Care was taken to fill the graft to a realistic level and not to overpack the defect. Suturing was done after adapting the buccal and lingual flaps well. A periodontal pack was placed, and antibiotics and analgesics were prescribed for the patient for 5 days. A fluoride-containing mouthwash was prescribed postsurgically to the patient.\n\n【43】Healing was uneventful, and a postoperative evaluation 3 weeks after surgery showed absence of bleeding on probing and probing depths within normal limits . The patient was put on regular recall appointments for evaluation of the gingival and periodontal status and maintenance therapy. A postoperative radiograph 6 months later showed a significant bone fill in the molar regions where grafting was done with an increase in bone density of the alveolar crest with corticated bone formations in the crest at the other areas . The oral hygiene maintenance and compliance of the patient was excellent, and there were no signs of recurrence of the disease throughout the maintenance period. Since the patient was concerned about the esthetic appearance of the anterior teeth, she was advised to undergo adult orthodontic therapy after 1 year of surgery under regular periodontal monitoring and was referred to an orthodontic specialist for the same.\n\n【44】##### 6.3. Case Report 2\n\n【45】A 26-year-old male patient presented with the chief complaint of generalized pus discharge from gums which he had been experiencing intermittently for the past 2 years . Pus discharge was associated with bad breath and usually subsided spontaneously after a few weeks. There was no associated complaint other than a generalized mild hypersensitivity to cold and sweet food. He had a history of extraction of lower left posterior tooth due to caries exposure and extraction of lower front tooth due to mobility about 1 year before. There was no history of any other dental treatment.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 9 | (a) and (b) Clinical presentation with deep pockets, recession, and pathologic migration of teeth. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【47】The patient was systemically healthy, and medical history did not reveal any relevant findings. Family history revealed that the patient’s mother had similar complaints of mobility, pus discharge, and spontaneous exfoliation of some teeth following which she consulted a dentist and underwent total extraction by the age of 40. The patient was a nonsmoker, and there was no history of use of any other forms of tobacco.\n\n【48】Extraoral examination revealed bilateral submandibular lymph node enlargement, which was firm, mobile, and nontender.\n\n【49】All teeth were present except for 46, 26, and 41. Tooth 46 was extracted due to caries and 41 was extracted due to mobility. Tooth 26 was grossly decayed with just root stump present. The oral hygiene status of the patient was fair with moderate deposits of calculus and plaque.\n\n【50】Intraoral examination revealed a normal color of gingiva except in the labial aspect of 31, 32, and 33 where the marginal gingiva was slightly reddish. Gingival margins were rounded, and exudation was present in relation to labial aspects of mandibular anterior teeth and maxillary central incisors. There was generalized bleeding on probing and recession in relation to most of the teeth, especially more in maxillary central incisors and mandibular anterior teeth.\n\n【51】There was grade I mobility of 15 and 22 and grade II mobility of 11, 12, 21, 31, 32, 33 and 42. Proximal contacts were lost between maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth with pathologic migration of 11, 21, 31, 32, and 42 and extrusion of 31. Grade II furcation involvement was present with molars and maxillary first premolars. A full mouth periodontal examination revealed generalized deep periodontal pockets and severe generalized clinical attachment loss .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 10 | Pretreatment periodontal charting shows deep pockets with generalized clinical attachment loss. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【53】Severe periodontal destruction was evident with more than 10 mm of clinical attachment loss at multiple sites especially in the incisor and canine regions.\n\n【54】OPG and IOPA X-rays revealed a generalized distribution of periodontal bone loss especially severe in the incisor and canine regions with the molars and premolars affected to a lesser degree . There was predominantly vertical bone loss in the canine and incisor regions. Routine blood investigations were within normal limits.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 11 | Orthopantomogram showing generalized bone loss with advanced vertical defect in 13 and 33 regions. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【56】A diagnosis of generalized aggressive periodontitis was made according to the established criteria (American Academy of Periodontology, 1999).\n\n【57】##### 6.4. Management\n\n【58】Supragingival scaling was performed, and the patient was educated in oral hygiene maintenance. The patient was advised to follow a modified Stillman technique of brushing since the patient had root exposure and hypersensitivity and also advised to use interdental brushes and dental floss for optimal plaque control. The patient was prescribed topical antimicrobial agents (metronidazole gel) along with chlorhexidine mouthwash for 2 weeks. A combination systemic antibiotic therapy of amoxicillin and metronidazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> was initiated, and a desensitizing agent was prescribed. A recall visit after 2 weeks showed reduction in inflammation and percentage of sites showing bleeding on probing. Exudation was persistent in relation to 11 and 33 regions. A subgingival scaling and root planing was performed following which a povidone iodine 5% irrigation was performed. A nonsustained professionally delivered local drug delivery with metronidazole gel was injected subgingivally at sites 33 and 11, following which a periodontal dressing was given at the site. The procedure was performed every 3 days for the next 2 weeks. Evaluation after 3 weeks showed complete absence of bleeding on probing, exudation, and significant reduction in probing pocket depth. The patient was put on maintenance therapy during which he continued with the topical antimicrobial agents and desensitizing agents and was evaluated for surgical therapy.\n\n【59】A full-mouth flap surgery with bone grafts (synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAP)), where indicated, was performed sextantwise at intervals of two weeks. In addition, the defect at site 33 was treated with guided tissue regeneration (GTR) with bioresorbable collagen membrane in conjunction with synthetic bone graft (HAP) .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 12 | (a)–(c) Flap surgery in conjunction with bone grafting (HAP) and papilla preservation flap between 11 and 21.

Radiographs showed bone fill in the region where bone grafts alone or in conjunction with GTR were used . Regular recall appointments were given for maintenance therapy during which the treatment results were well maintained. However, there was a slight increase in recession due to shrinkage of gingiva on healing and hypersensitivity after the surgery which gradually subsided on regular use of desensitizing agents and fluoride mouthwashes.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 13 | (a) and (b) Postoperative photographs showing probing depths within normal limits with excellent gingival condition; however, there was slight increase in recession after healing.

Discussion\n\n【64】The key to successful treatment is early diagnosis. Early diagnosis helps in prevention of progression of the disease thus avoiding the possibility of advanced tissue destruction and alveolar bone loss. The earlier the diagnosis is the better the prognosis of the dentition will be. Furthermore since it has a tendency for familial aggregation, it is important to do a periodontal examination of siblings and other close blood relatives of the patient which helps in early diagnosis of the disease in the family members. Management of GAgP patients essentially consists of a nonsurgical phase, surgical therapy an interdisciplinary therapy and a lifelong supportive periodontal therapy.\n\n【65】##### 7.1. Nonsurgical/Etiotropic Phase of Therapy\n\n【66】Nonsurgical therapy remains the first line of antimicrobial therapy in GAgP. Early stages of the disease with mild to moderate periodontal and bone destruction may be managed entirely by nonsurgical therapy with systemic antibiotics as an adjuvant to mechanical therapy.\n\n【67】Therapy should start with attempts at controlling or eliminating the etiologic agents and modifiable risk factors for the disease. The disease has a strong genetic predisposition. The host response of the patient or the susceptible individual to pathogenic bacteria in the dental plaque plays a vital role in the pathogenesis and expression of the disease, and this host response is genetically determined and is an unmodifiable risk factor is at present by the current treatment measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. However, since the expression of the disease in susceptible individuals is also influenced by microbial and environmental risk factors, the disease can be successfully kept under control by controlling the microbial and environmental factors. This underlies the importance of optimal plaque control both by personally employed methods used by the patient himself and professionally employed plaque control measures by the dental team to the patient. Even a minimal amount of plaque is enough to elicit untoward host response in those patients susceptible to the disease, and a reduced resistance to the invasion of subgingival plaque can be compensated for by a correspondingly strong emphasis on total plaque control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【68】Mechanical plaque control can be successfully achieved by educating and motivating the patient if needed with the aid of disclosing solutions regarding the need for optimal plaque control, demonstration of brushing techniques (modified Bass technique for patients without gingival recession and modified Stillman technique in patients with hypersensitivity and generalized recession), and use of interdental cleansing aids like dental floss and interdental brushes where indicated. This behavioral modification from the patient needs a positive reinforcement and encouragement from the dental team. Regular recall appointments to monitor the efficacy of the patient’s plaque control measures are essential.\n\n【69】Chemical plaque control agents like chlorhexidine 0.12% or 0.2% mouthwashes, and 1% povidone iodine can be advised for further plaque control as an adjunct to the patient’s mechanical plaque control measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Amine fluoride and stannous fluoride mouth rinses and tooth pastes as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures in GAgP patients were found to be effective in controlling supragingival plaque accumulations in aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 30\\]</u>. Additionally use of fluoride mouthwashes is advised to help in remineralization of the exposed root surfaces, and for patients complaining of hypersensitivity, use of desensitizing toothpastes and mouthwashes is mandatory.\n\n【70】Smoking has been well documented as a significant risk factor for aggressive periodontitis with GAgP patients who smoke having more affected teeth and more loss of clinical attachment than nonsmoking patients with GAgP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Furthermore the response to periodontal therapy, both nonsurgical and surgical, regenerative therapy, and implant therapy is less than in nonsmokers, but former smokers respond similar to nonsmokers. This underlies the therapeutic effect of smoking cessation and cessation of other forms of tobacco, and patients should be advised of the benefits of smoking cessation and the potential risks of smoking in worsening their periodontal condition, and if needed expert counseling for cessation of the habit should be sought 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32–36\\]</u>.\n\n【71】###### 7.1.1. Mechanical Antimicrobial Therapy\n\n【72】Scaling and root planing (SRP) which eliminates the microbial bacterial load from the periodontal pockets and removes the local etiologic factors is performed either as a quadrant-wise SRP at 2-week interval or as a full mouth scaling and root planning completed on the same day. However, both modalities have been found to be efficacious with significant improvement in clinical parameters, and the clinician should select the treatment modality based on the practical considerations related to the patient preference and clinical workload 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.\n\n【73】Another approach to mechanical antimicrobial therapy is a one-stage full mouth disinfection therapy devised by Quirynen et al. which was found to result in an improved clinical outcome and microbial improvement in early onset periodontitis compared to quadrant-wise SRP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. Full-mouth disinfection therapy includes full-mouth debridement (scaling and root planning, brushing of the tongue with 1% chlorhexidine for 1 minute, rinsing of the mouth with a 0.2% chlorhexidine solution for 2 minutes, and irrigation of periodontal pockets with 1% chlorhexidine solution), completed in 2 appointments within a 24-hour period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>.\n\n【74】###### 7.1.2. Photodynamic Therapy and Laser Irradiation\n\n【75】These have been tried as adjuncts to mechanical therapy to inhibit the pathogenic bacteria in periodontal pockets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41–44\\]</u>.\n\n【76】Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a noninvasive photochemical approach for infection control which combines the application of a nontoxic chemical agent or photosensitizer with low-level light energy and has shown clinical evidence of efficient eradication of periodontal bacteria from subgingival sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. This novel therapeutic approach of antimicrobial therapy seems promising and is getting attention recently either as a monotherapy or as an adjunct to SRP in the nonsurgical treatment of aggressive periodontitis. Both PDT and SRP have been shown to have similar clinical results in the nonsurgical treatment of aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42, 43\\]</u>.\n\n【77】Laser irradiation of subgingival sites to eradicate periodontopathic microorganisms is also being considered in the nonsurgical therapy of periodontitis patients. Diode laser treatment has shown a superior clinical and microbiological effect when used along with SRP, compared to SRP alone or laser therapy alone in aggressive periodontitis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.\n\n【78】A regular recall visit preferably at one-week intervals should be performed especially at the initial stages of the treatment to monitor the efficiency of the patient’s plaque control measures and to assess the response of the patient towards nonsurgical therapy.\n\n【79】###### 7.1.3. Chemical Antimicrobial Therapy in the Management of GAgP\n\n【80】Role of Systemic Antibiotic Therapy in GAgP  \nSystemic antibiotics are indicated in aggressive periodontitis since the pathogenic bacteria like Aggregatibacter actinomycetem-comitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis have been found to be tissue invasive and mechanical therapy is insufficient to eliminate the bacteria from these sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58, 59\\]</u>. Systemically administered antibiotics with or without scaling and root planning and/or surgery provided greater clinical improvement in attachment level change compared to similar periodontal therapy without antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Earlier tetracyclines were used extensively for this purpose since systemic tetracycline was found to be a useful adjunct to mechanical periodontal therapy in patients with aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46–48\\]</u>, but the concern for tetracycline resistance has shifted the focus to the use of other antibiotics both as combination therapy or serial antibiotic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.  \nThe preferred combination antibiotic therapy at present for treatment of GAgP is 250 mg of amoxicillin thrice daily along with metronidazole 250 mg twice daily for 8 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 49\\]</u>. It is one of the most evaluated drug combinations in GAgP, and there is ample evidence now to show that Amoxycillin-Metronidazole combination as an adjunctive treatment in GAgP at initial therapy significantly improves the results and hence should be preferred over other antibiotic regimens as the first-line treatment  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50–55\\]</u>.  \nThe usefulness of microbial testing may be limited because of the variability of test reports between different labs and the mixed flora, and hence an empiric use of antibiotics like the above-mentioned combination may be more clinically sound and cost-effective than bacterial identification and antibiotic-sensitivity testing in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.  \nSingle-agent therapy with Doxycycline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53, 55\\]</u>, azithromycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>, metronidazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53, 57\\]</u>, and clindamycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u> is effective when used adjunctively to nonsurgical procedure of SRP in AgP patients. The criteria for selection of antibiotics are not clear in AgP; the choice depends on the case, disease-related factors and patient-related factors like compliance, allergies, and potential side effects.\n\n【81】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 The list of antibiotic regimens with evidence of superior clinical outcome when used as an adjuvant to SRP in GAgP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 45–57\\]</u>.</u>\n\n【82】###### 7.1.4. Local Drug Delivery of Antimicrobial Agents\n\n【83】Topical application of antimicrobial agents and local drug delivery is also a treatment option especially if there are localized areas of exudation and deep pockets not responding adequately to mechanical and systemic antibiotic therapy. Local drug delivery delivers the drugs at high concentrations at the site of infection when compared to systemic antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, this is an option in patients where there is intolerance to systemic administration of the antibiotic.\n\n【84】Several local anti-infective agents combined with SRP appear to provide additional benefits in PD reduction and CAL gain compared to SRP alone. Over the past 20 years, locally delivered, anti-infective pharmacological agents, most recently employing sustained-release vehicles, have been introduced to achieve this goal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>.\n\n【85】Though there is more evidence on its application in chronic periodontitis, till future researches are available; the same agents can be employed in aggressive periodontitis patients as well empirically. Adjunctive use of LDD agents like controlled release biodegradable chlorhexidine gluconate chip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61, 62\\]</u>, tetracycline fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63, 64\\]</u>, and minocycline-Hcl gel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65\\]</u> has been tried in aggressive periodontitis with superior clinical outcomes. The decision to use local anti-infective adjunctive therapy remains a matter of individual clinical judgment, the phase of treatment, and the patient’s status and preferences.\n\n【86】An evaluation of the response to nonsurgical treatment is done 2-3 weeks after treatment during which the gingival and periodontal status of the patient will be reevaluated and compared with the pretreatment values to assess the response to therapy and to assess the areas which need surgical therapy. Sites with persisting pockets >5 mm depth, vertical bone defects which need regenerative therapy, difficult to instrument areas like furcation involvement, and areas which need recontouring or resective osteoplasty are indications for surgery.\n\n【87】##### 7.2. Surgical Therapy\n\n【88】It essentially consists of open flap debridement either alone or as a combination with resective or regenerative procedures. The main aim of a flap procedure is to get access and visibility to root and furcation areas so that a thorough instrumentation and debridement can be performed. Flap techniques like modified Widman flap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>, modified flap operation/Kirkland flap (sulcular incision flap) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[66\\]</u> achieve this aim without eliminating the pockets. A resective flap procedure like undisplaced flap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u> will eliminate the pockets as well but compromise the esthetics and function of the dentition by root exposure and resultant hypersensitivity and hence is not preferred usually when compared to modified Widman flap or sulcular incision flap.\n\n【89】Laser-assisted surgery (Nd: YAG laser) is suggested as a valid alternative to conventional scalpel surgical therapy, in individuals at increased surgical risk like in coagulation and platelet function disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[68\\]</u>.\n\n【90】###### 7.2.1. Regenerative Surgical Therapy\n\n【91】Regeneration of the periodontal supporting structures lost due to periodontal disease so that the form and function of the periodontium is reestablished has been an elusive or difficult-to-achieve goal for periodontal therapists.\n\n【92】Various modalities are being employed for periodontal regeneration which includes use of bone replacement grafts, barrier membranes or guided tissue regeneration (GTR), biologic modifiers like growth and differentiation factors (GDF), and extracellular matrix proteins like enamel matrix proteins (EMD) or use of a combination of the above techniques and materials which has been extensively reviewed elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[69\\]</u>.\n\n【93】A sulcular incision flap or papilla preservation flap will be the ideal technique to minimize recession in the anterior regions due to esthetic reasons, and modified Widman flap or conventional/sulcular incision flap will be the technique of choice in the posterior regions when opting for bone grafting and another regenerative therapy. A papilla preservation flap is preferred for bone grafting when there is spacing between the teeth to obtain maximum coverage of the graft material at the interdental region and to prevent shrinkage of papilla on healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u>. Biomodification of the root surface (Root conditioning) with citric acid, tetracycline, or fibronectin is preferable when performing bone grafting or GTR for better clinical results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[69\\]</u>.\n\n【94】###### 7.2.2. Bone Replacement Grafts\n\n【95】Bone grafting is indicated in vertical defects, and the success of the procedure depends on the type of defect. Three-walled or intrabony defect is the ideal defect for bone grafts and has a better success rate compared to a two-walled and one-walled defect. The type of bone graft which gives the maximum benefit with minimum tissue reaction is autograft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[70\\]</u>, but there are limitations of obtaining it in large quantities as is needed in most cases of generalized aggressive periodontitis. A more feasible option is to use commercially available bone grafts, which are allograft, xenograft, or alloplastic materials.\n\n【96】Allografts used for periodontal grafts include mineralized freeze-dried bone allografts (FDBAs) which are osteoconductive, and decalcified freeze-dried bone allografts (DFDBAs) which are osteoinductive. Decalcification of the graft exposes the complex bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) from its matrix which can induce osteoblastic proliferation in the recipient site. DFDBA, because of its osteoinductive property, has shown to have better results than the alloplastic materials which are osteoconductive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[71\\]</u>. Allogeneic freeze-dried bone (FDBA) mixed with tetracycline powder along with systemic tetracycline has demonstrated a better clinical outcome in treatment of juvenile periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72\\]</u>.\n\n【97】Xenografts used are either bovine derived or coral derived. An osteoconductive bovine-derived anorganic bone, Bio-Oss, has been successfully used in periodontal defects with resulting bone regeneration and new attachment in these defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[73–75\\]</u>. Human histologic studies have shown that a combination of Bio-Oss with either purified porcine collagen (Bio-Oss Collagen) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[76\\]</u> or a synthetic cell-binding polypeptide (Pepgen P-15) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[77\\]</u> has the capacity of inducing regeneration of the periodontal attachment apparatus when placed in intrabony defects. Coralline grafts implanted into human periodontal defects have produced better clinical results when compared to nongrafted sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[78\\]</u>.\n\n【98】Synthetic grafts/alloplastic grafts have been considered primarily as defect fillers. The most commonly used among alloplastic graft materials is hydroxyapatite (HAP) which is osteoconductive and has shown to have similar clinical effect to FDBA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[79\\]</u>. Other alloplastic grafts which can be used are beta tricalcium phosphate and bioactive glass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[80, 81\\]</u>.\n\n【99】A synthetic hydroxyapatite/equine type I collagen/chondroitin sulphate biomaterial (Biostite) has been found to show comparable improvements to Bio-Oss in terms of clinical attachment gain, pocket depth reduction, and radiographic bone fill in the treatment of deep intraosseous defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[82\\]</u>.\n\n【100】###### 7.2.3. Guided Tissue Regeneration\n\n【101】Guided tissue regeneration promotes regeneration by acting as a barrier which prevents apical migration of epithelium and exclude gingival connective tissue from the healing wound, thus allowing the pluripotent periodontal ligament cells to populate the site of healing enhancing new cementum and new attachment procedures.\n\n【102】GTR has shown to have a greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement alone, including improved attachment gain, reduced pocket depth, less increase in gingival recession, and more gain in hard tissue probing at reentry surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[83\\]</u>. Research has shown that GTR in conjunction with bone grafting has better potential for regeneration compared with either technique alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[74, 84, 85\\]</u>, and this outcome has been confirmed in aggressive periodontitis also with the use of bioresorbable membranes (Bio-Gide) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[75, 80\\]</u>.\n\n【103】###### 7.2.4. Biologic Mediators and Extracellular Proteins\n\n【104】A wide array of regenerative materials is being considered for use in periodontitis. Use of biologic mediators like growth factors (insulin-like growth factor (ILGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)) use of platelet-rich plasma which contains PDGF, extracellular matrix proteins like emdogain, etc. are of promising results. Application of enamel matrix proteins alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[86\\]</u> or in combination with bone grafts including bioactive glass has shown to result in the successful treatment of intrabony defects in aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[87\\]</u>.\n\n【105】Beneficial effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of periodontal defects have been demonstrated by clinical and radiographic measurements together with reentry results showing marked improvements from baseline with increased stabilization of whole dentition including the hopeless teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[88, 89\\]</u>.\n\n【106】Various commercially available regenerative materials including bone replacement grafts, GTR membranes, enamel matrix derivatives, are in the market for use in periodontal therapy with varying results, and the choice of the material depends on the dentist’s preference and experience with the products helping in clinical judgment of the therapeutic results of individual products and procedures and their cost-benefit ratio.\n\n【107】##### 7.3. Role of Maintenance Therapy in Management of Aggressive Periodontitis\n\n【108】The importance of supportive periodontal therapy has to be stressed in management of aggressive periodontitis. Regular SPT was found to be effective in maintaining clinical and microbiological improvements attained after active periodontal therapy in early onset periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[90\\]</u>.\n\n【109】The maintenance therapy starts soon after the phase I therapy or nonsurgical therapy and should be continued throughout the lifetime of the patient. Or in other words, “maintenance therapy never ends” for a GAgP patient. In order to maintain the optimal results got by surgery and to prevent the recurrence of the disease, a lifelong maintenance therapy is mandatory because of the strong genetic susceptibility of the individual to the disease.\n\n【110】The frequency of the recall visits depends on the response of the individual to treatment and presence of other risk factors like environmental factors but generally will be more frequent than that in chronic periodontitis or in localized aggressive periodontitis. Any site which shows signs of recurrence of the disease like bleeding on probing which is considered as the first clinical sign of inflammation should be treated vigorously and monitored for resolution of the signs.\n\n【111】##### 7.4. Interdisciplinary Approach for Management of Resultant Esthetic, Functional, and Psychologic Problems in GAgP\n\n【112】A comprehensive management for total rehabilitation of the GAgP patients not only involves control of infection and arrest of progression and/or regenerative therapy by the periodontist but also incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to attend the esthetic, functional, and psychologic problems faced by the patient.\n\n【113】An orthodontic therapy with concomitant periodontal monitoring and prosthetic rehabilitation, if possible with the use of implants and psychologic counseling, may be needed for patients with advanced forms of the disease.\n\n【114】###### 7.4.1. Combined Periodontal-Orthodontic Therapy\n\n【115】Cosmetic concerns in young aggressive periodontitis patients will be high since the disease can result in flaring, protrusion, pathologic migration, and even extrusion of the anterior teeth. Malocclusion, pathologic migration and potential occlusal traumatism which can cause secondary trauma from occlusion can be corrected by orthodontic therapy in GAgP patients already stabilized by periodontal therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[91–94\\]</u>. Orthodontic treatment can be commenced once attachment gain and bone stability is achieved after periodontal therapy but is generally advised to postpone till 3 months to 1 year after active periodontal therapy. A combined periodontal and orthodontic treatment demands a detailed evaluation in both specialties, particularly when the periodontium is reduced. Periodontal evaluations are scheduled concomitantly with orthodontic appointments to monitor the periodontal stability as the tooth movement occurs.\n\n【116】###### 7.4.2. Prosthodontic Rehabilitation, Implant Therapy, and Implant Supported Prosthesis\n\n【117】Gingival recession with loss of interdental papilla especially in the anterior teeth is unaesthetic especially when the patient smiles and the feasibility of root coverage periodontal plastic surgery will be limited in generalized aggressive periodontitis because of the large number of teeth involved and the advanced interdental bone loss. A porcelain, resin, silicone, or copolyamide removable gingival prosthesis (gum veneer/gingival mask) can be fabricated to mask the recession and improve the appearance of the anterior teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[95\\]</u>. The restoration of the teeth lost due to periodontitis should be done with fixed or removable prosthesis depending on the bone support of the remaining teeth.\n\n【118】Contradictory to the earlier concept that implants are not a feasible option in GAgP patients, the use of implants and implant-supported prosthesis to restore the lost teeth is increasingly considered as a treatment option in well-maintained GAgP patients even though the risk of bone loss and attachment loss around implants is higher than that in chronic periodontitis patients or periodontally healthy individuals, with researches showing good survival of implants over a 10-year period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[96\\]</u>. Several reports are there which have successfully used osseointegrated implants in oral rehabilitation of partially edentulous patients treated for GAgP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[97–99\\]</u>.\n\n【119】###### 7.4.3. Psychotherapy\n\n【120】Perhaps the least recognized and the most underestimated aspect in the total rehabilitation of a patient with GAgP presenting with multiple tooth loss and/or advanced periodontal destruction necessitating extraction of multiple teeth is the need for psychological counseling and psychotherapy. It aims at attending the psychologic effect and potential mental depression following tooth loss due to rapid periodontal destruction which provides the patient with relatively less time to cope with the situation. The emotional effects of tooth loss are devastating for some patients and have a dramatic impact on their life, and they take longer time to come to terms with the tooth loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[100\\]</u>. Preparing the patients with advanced disease having multiple teeth with hopeless prognosis emotionally for extraction also has to be dealt with carefully by the dentist, if needed using multiple appointments, and the extent of the impact that bad news, such as having to lose teeth, has on an individual is most often dependent on the way in which the information is communicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[101\\]</u>. Depression, anxiety and social withdrawal are seen in patients with tooth loss, and resulting compromised esthetics can be helped with therapy, relaxation techniques, and, in some cases, antidepressants. Any of the above symptoms should be addressed with a qualified psychotherapist to improve the quality of life.\n\n【121】Psychotherapy has to be started immediately following the first appointment and should be continued concomitantly for total rehabilitation of the patient for a variable duration depending upon the psychologic status of the individual patient. In addition, stress reduction protocols may help in management of the disease as such in the view of the recent suggestions of the proposed mechanisms by which stress can contribute to the onset, exacerbation and maintenance of the periodontal disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[102\\]</u>. A recent study reported that psychotherapy offered at 3 levels (individual, group, and conjoint family psychotherapy) to GAgP patients gave positive psychologic effects that restored their ability to socialize in their environment contributing to their positive experience in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[103\\]</u>. The above facts suggest that psychotherapy be incorporated for the future protocols for treatment of GAgP patients suffering from emotional effects of tooth loss.\n\n【122】###### 7.4.4. Other Treatment Modalities and Future Trends in Management of Aggressive Periodontitis\n\n【123】Host modulation therapy with systemically and locally administered agents is under research for therapy in aggressive periodontitis. Subantibacterial dose of Doxycycline has been approved for use in chronic periodontitis, but its use in aggressive periodontitis has to be confirmed by research. Adjunctive use of locally administered alendronate gel with SRP for host modulation has shown promising results in aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[104\\]</u>.\n\n【124】Newer generations of regenerative materials and advances in tissue engineering for regeneration and genetic engineering to modify the genetic risk factors seem to be really promising in the future. With further understanding of the genetic risk factors, a futuristic application of genetic screening tests will be in identifying the susceptible individuals and instituting the preventive measures to keep the gene expression and thus the disease under control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[105, 106\\]</u>.\n\n【125】###### 7.4.5. A Suggested Protocol for the Comprehensive and Total Rehabilitation of GAgP Patients with the Current Treatment Modalities\n\n【126】For more details see Figure 14.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 14 | The treatment commences with a nonsurgical phase following which psychotherapy sessions are started for the needy patients, and patients are put on maintenance therapy/supportive periodontal therapy thereafter. While the patient is on maintenance therapy, one or more of the 3 modalities of surgical periodontal therapy can be performed depending upon the indication and once periodontium has been stabilized, an interdisciplinary treatment for the restoration of lost teeth and correction of cosmetic problems is completed following which the patient continues for a “lifelong” maintenance therapy. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【128】#### 8\\. Conclusion\n\n【129】Even though the prevalence of aggressive periodontitis is much lower than chronic periodontitis, the management of aggressive periodontitis is more challenging compared to that of chronic periodontitis because of its strong genetic predisposition as an unmodifiable risk factor. Researchers are going on employing the potential several novel technologies in regenerating the lost periodontium including tissue engineering and genetic engineering.\n\n【130】The key to successful management at present lies in early diagnosis of the disease and rigorous treatment employing the different treatment modalities mentioned in the paper along with systemic antibiotic therapy followed by meticulous lifelong maintenance therapy. With the current treatment modalities, successful long-term maintenance of the dentition in a healthy and functional state can be achieved. A comprehensive periodontal treatment consisting of mechanical/surgical and systemic antimicrobial therapy is found to be an appropriate treatment regimen for long-term stabilization of periodontal health with arrest of periodontal disease progression in 95% of the initially compromised lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[107\\]</u>.\n\n【131】Further understanding of the etiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and host immune response in aggressive periodontitis along with advances in regenerative concepts, tissue engineering, and gene therapy is needed for formulating better management protocols in the treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:12:54", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:13:34", "cost": 40.174}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:13:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:12:54"}

Other physical examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【9】Hematology, biochemistry, and coagulation tests and cardiac enzymes were all in normal ranges.\n\n【10】His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and no ST segment or T wave changes. A comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography revealed ejection fraction (EF) = 60%, mild mitral regurgitation, trivial tricuspid regurgitation, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) = 30 MMHG, and a round pedunculated semimobile dense mass (1.6 cm 1.8 cm) in right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) with attachment to the base of the septum with no obstruction of RVOT .

The patient presented two months after surgery following a urinary tract infection in septic shock with a discharging sternal wound and blood cultures positive for Proteus mirabilis. Imaging revealed a large anterior mediastinal abscess and aortic pseudoaneurysm which subsequently ruptured resulting in fatality. Gram-negative mediastinitis is a rare complication of cardiac surgery that can present late following initial clinical improvement and should be considered when “remote site” infections are present. Computerised Tomography scanning has a role to play in the identification of this.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Mediastinitis is a recognised complication following median sternotomy. Despite relatively low reported incidences of approximately 1–4%, postoperative mediastinitis poses a detrimental effect on morbidity and survival, with mortality rates as high as 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A plethora of studies exist attributing a whole host of risk factors in the pathogenesis of this condition, sometimes with conflicting views. It is proposed that development of mediastinitis is a multifactorial process involving both host and perioperative factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Most cases of mediastinal wound infections are attributed to gram-positive pathogens with Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated in 70 to 80% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Another complication of cardiac surgery is pseudoaneurysm formation involving the ascending aorta. This is rare with a reported incidence of less than 0.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. These false aneurysms represent a dreaded complication, with rupture as the most deleterious consequence. Postoperative development of aortic pseudoaneurysms is commonly encountered at sites of aortic wall disruption with aortotomy sites being the most commonly implicated following aortic valve replacement.\n\n【5】We report a case of an occult mediastinal abscess presenting in association with a ruptured mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta in the setting of perioperative infection due to a gram-negative pathogen.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】An 84-year-old female with a known history of congestive cardiac failure, hypertension, and stable angina was initially seen in the Emergency Department at Horton General Hospital, Banbury. She presented with an acute onset of rapidly worsening exertional dyspnoea and reduced exercise tolerance. She was subsequently diagnosed with critical aortic valve stenosis following transthoracic echocardiography and underwent an urgent aortic valve replacement. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful except for the development of a pericardial effusion requiring drainage on the 10th day. Microbiological analysis of the pericardial fluid yielded cultures of the gram-negative pathogen, Proteus mirabillis. The patient completed a full course of intravenous gentamicin for 3 weeks with serial negative blood cultures. The wound site appeared to be healing well throughout this time. Further transesophageal echocardiography revealed no significant pericardial effusion and the patient subsequently made a good recovery and was discharged. Further cross-sectional imaging was not performed at this time.\n\n【8】Four weeks following discharge from hospital (two months postoperatively), the patient represented with fever, worsening dyspnoea at rest, and light headedness. She was clinically in septic shock and physical examination revealed an erythematous, warm anterior chest wall alongside a fluctuant swelling overlying the sternotomy scar with some purulent discharge. Laboratory data included a severe normocytic anaemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and significantly raised inflammatory markers. Subsequent blood cultures grew meropenem sensitive Proteus mirabillis.\n\n【9】Initial treatment against the bacteraemia consisted of intravenous gentamicin and meropenem based on a working diagnosis of mediastinitis with or without bacterial endocarditis. The chest radiograph was unremarkable. Subsequent chest CT revealed osteomyelitis of the sternum, contiguous with a large anterior mediastinal abscess measuring 67 mm by 44 mm in diameter . The more interesting radiological feature was the direct communication and erosion of the abscess cavity into the anterior ascending aorta resulting in a localised periaortic area of contrast extravasation . The concomitant presence of endocarditis was ruled out on echocardiography which also revealed the large mediastinal cavity in close proximity to the aortic root as well as a 1.4 cm diameter pseudoaneurysm in the anterior ascending aorta.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Axial slice from contrast-enhanced CT study depicting sternal osteomyelitis and a large related mediastinal collection (black curved arrow).

In view of her comorbidities, surgery was not deemed a suitable option and consequently the patient died soon after with pseudoaneurysm rupture as the attributed cause of death.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Sternotomy wound complications following cardiothoracic surgery have been well documented in the medical literature and can have varied manifestations from sterile wound dehiscence to suppurative mediastinitis. Mediastinitis is often used synonymously to denote deep sternal wound infections, whereby wound infection is complicated by sternal osteomyelitis with or without the infective involvement of the retrosternal space. Wound discharge is the most common reported feature occurring in 70 to 90% of the cases, with other local manifestations including chest wall tenderness and sternal dehiscence.\n\n【15】Most cases of mediastinal wound infections are attributed to Gram-positive pathogens with Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated in 70 to 80% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> with Pseudomonas being the most reported Gram-negative causative organism. Gram-negative mediastinal infections though less frequently incriminated are often associated with a more complicated postoperative course. In addition these cases are often encountered with other concomitant “remote-site” infections most commonly pneumonias and urinary tract infections which are reported to cooccur in up to 58% of the cases postoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【16】One such postoperative complication demonstrated by this case is the formation of a pseudoaneurysm. Pseudoaneurysms or false aneurysms involving the ascending aorta are rare sequelae of cardiac surgery with a reported incidence of less than 0.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. These aneurysms represent a dreaded complication, with rupture as the most deleterious consequence. Postoperative development of aortic pseudoaneurysms is commonly encountered at sites of aortic wall disruption with aortotomy sites being the most commonly implicated following aortic valve replacement.\n\n【17】Several theories exist regarding the pathogenesis but infection is often heralded as the common denominator as in the case reported herein. Infected or mycotic pseudoaneurysms represent approximately 2.7% of all postsurgical aneurysms and are most often attributed to Staphylococcus and Salmonella species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Early recognition and diagnosis of postoperative infective complications of cardiac surgery are imperative. Patients who have recently undergone open heart surgery that present with chest pain following any infection, even of a site and/or organism that is not usually associated with mediastinitis, should merit a high index of suspicion and should be investigated appropriately.\n\n【19】As demonstrated by this case, clinical improvement, negative blood cultures, and an unremarkable transesophageal echocardiography do not necessarily rule out an ongoing infective process and the development of complications such as a pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】Proteus mediastinitis is a rare complication of open cardiac surgery that can present late following initial clinical improvement and negative blood cultures and can result in potentially fatal pseudoaneurysm formation.\n\n【22】CT scanning has a role to play in the identification of these complications and should be considered prior to discharge in at-risk patients with sternal wound infections.\n\n【23】Postoperative vigilance for infective complications should be maintained after discharge and Gram-negative causative organisms such as Proteus mirabillis should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:55", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:01:17", "cost": 21.842}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:01:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:54"}

Primary pathophysiology is the entry of calcium that exceeds its excretion into urine or deposition in bone into circulation.

Concordantly, there has been a resurgence of milk-alkali syndrome associated with the ingestion of large amounts of calcium and absorbable alkali, making it the third leading cause of hypercalcemia (Beall and Scofield, 1995 and Picolos et al. 2005).

The Sippy regimen until the 1970s was used for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, a disorder that was predominant in middle-aged men, when nonantacid treatment was first introduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Sippy's original recommendation consisted of the hourly administration of milk and cream together with what became known as the Sippy powders, which were 10 grains (1 grain = 65 mg) each of heavily calcinated magnesia and sodium bicarbonate, alternating with a powder that contained 10 grains of bismuth subcarbonate and 20 to 30 grains of sodium bicarbonate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Hardt and Rivers in 1923 gave a detailed description of the toxicity that was associated with the antacid and milk regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The symptoms consisted of nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, musculoskeletal pains, and weakness followed by prostration. There was an associated elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, alkalosis, and albuminuria. Cope in 1936 first recognized hypercalcemia as a major feature of this toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. He also showed a rapid resolution of alkalosis and hypercalcemia after cessation of treatment, but the recovery of renal function was much slower. Fundamentally, the differentiation of milk-alkali syndrome from primary hyperparathyroidism was evident due to the absence of hypophosphatemia and the resolution of the hypercalcemia once treatment with antacids was stopped. Burnett et al. in 1949 described a chronic variant of the milk-alkali syndrome in which renal failure was persistent and soft tissue calcifications were extensive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Punsar and Somer in 1963 classified milk-alkali syndrome into three different types: acute, subacute (Cope’s syndrome), and chronic (Burnett’s syndrome) toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Shortly thereafter, McMillan and Freeman formulated a comprehensive table and compared clinical presentation, biochemical findings, and resolution of the three different types of the milk-alkali syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The subacute form (Cope’s syndrome) was seen during therapy with calcium and alkali that had been used intermittently for years. In contrast to the acute form, there was less rapid improvement in symptoms and the recovery of renal function was slower. The chronic form (Burnett’s syndrome) occurred after a long history of ingestion of large amounts of calcium and alkali. Presentation of Burnett's syndrome included complains of pruritus, diffuse musculoskeletal symptoms, nephrocalcinosis, and band keratopathy with large soft tissue calcium deposits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8\\]</u>. Although symptoms usually improved with the discontinuation of calcium antacids, the resolution of hypercalcemia was slow, especially in patients with large soft tissue deposits of calcium. Renal insufficiency often improved but did not resolve completely.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】Our patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency room (ER) with a 2-week complaint of progressive weakness, dizziness on ambulation, nausea, and per accompanying family members, a deterioration in mental status. In the ER, he was hemodynamically stable, but serum analysis was significant for hypercalcemia of 16.9 with corrected calcium per serum albumin 18.2 (normal 8.4–10.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), formula for corrected serum calcium = measured serum calcium + 0.8 \\ (normal albumin – measured patient albumin)), alkalosis with bicarbonate 34.6 (normal 21.0–31.0 millimole per liter (mmol/L), renal insufficiency with BUN 30 (normal 6–20 mg/dL) and creatinine 4.0 (normal 0.5–1.2 mg/dL), total protein 5.8 (normal 6.2–8.2 g/dL), albumin 3.0 (normal 3.2–5.0 g/dL), phosphorus 3.1 (normal 2.5–4.6 mg/dL), WBC 11.5 (normal 4.5–10.0 K/cumm), hemoglobin 14.3 (normal 13.0–17.0 g/dL), hematocrit 40.9 (normal 39.0–52.0), and platelets 341 (normal 140–400 K/cumm). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute, normal PR, and QRS intervals with QT/QTc 304/400 msec. Arterial blood gas showed alkalemia: pH 7.48 (normal 7.35–7.45), pCO<sup>2</sup> 46 (normal 35–45 mm/Hg), and O<sup>2</sup> saturation 99% (normal 95–98).\n\n【8】With this physical presentation, hypercalcemia with renal insufficiency and alkalosis, he was admitted to acute medicine floor. Management included aggressive fluid resuscitation with normal saline, acute coronary syndrome rule out, telemetry placement for cardiac arrhythmia monitoring, and workup for the etiology of hypercalcemia. On thorough history and chart review, the patient admitted to taking large quantities of over-the-counter calcium supplementation in the form of TUMS for his chronic acid reflux spanning over 3 decades. Recently, over the past several weeks, due to worsening reflux symptoms, he had increased his daily TUMS from 5-6 tablets to as much as 20–30 tablets per day. He had previously been seen in a cardiology clinic (6 months prior to this presentation) for followup of hypertension (HTN) and was started on low-dose hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg per day. He was seen in a pulmonary clinic for followup of lung nodule (which had previously been worked up as benign) and in a gastrointestinal clinic 2 months after cardiology visit and was noted to have serum Ca of 11.6. He was counseled extensively on stopping over the counter acid suppression and given prescription of omeprazole 40 mg BID which he decided not to take.\n\n【9】Etiology workup revealed ionized calcium (iCa) at 8.3 (normal 4.48–5.28 mg/dL), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) < 3.0 (normal 10–65 pg/mL) indicating non-PTH-mediated hypercalcemia, parathyroid-hormone-related peptide (PTHrp) at 0, Vit D 1,25 <8 (normal 18–64 pg/mL), and Vit D 25 at 23 (optimum level 25–80 ng/mL) ruling out malignancy and hypervitaminosis. Other causes were also ruled out with normal serum thyroid studies, serum protein electrophoresis, chest radiograph, and chest CT showing no new changes and renal ultrasound being benign. Gastroenterology and nephrology consults were obtained to conclude the diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome and to formulate multidisciplinary plan. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed grade IV reflux esophagitis, distal esophageal stricture, gastritis, and erosive duodenitis. Pathologic specimen was reported as benign squamous hyperplasia with negative stain for H. pylori. Initial fluid resuscitation was supplemented with IV proton pump inhibitor twice a day and nutrition evaluation and recommendation; all of which resulted in impressive resolution of hypercalcemia and restoration of renal functions to normal thus confirming milk-alkali syndrome. Patient was later discharged home on omeprazole 40 mg twice a day (BID) and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. As followup, he was seen in internal medicine clinic 3 months after discharge with serum Ca of 10.6, albumin 4.3, improvement in reflux symptoms, and baseline functional status.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】In the milk-alkali syndrome, hypercalcemia develops because the input of calcium (dietary intake and intestinal absorption) exceeds the output (primarily renal excretion). About 4 to 60 g/d of calcium carbonate has been reported to induce the milk-alkali syndrome, indicating that factors besides calcium intake contribute to the development of the milk-alkali syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Factors that can increase calcium input include increased dietary calcium intake, ingestion of supplemental calcium, enhanced intestinal absorption of calcium usually resulting from stimulation by vitamin D that is present in some calcium supplements, and other dietary factors. Calcium-containing compounds have also been shown to directly increase gastric acid secretion by stimulating the CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor) when ingested orally, which in turn increases the availability of free calcium for absorption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【12】It is likely that bone, the primary repository for calcium, increases calcium uptake but becomes saturated during high calcium exposure. The capacity of bone to increase calcium uptake per unit of bone changes with age as does the extent of bone remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. Randall et al. in 1961 gave insight into the time course of this syndrome after observing 40 men with peptic ulcer disease who were treated with milk and either aluminum hydroxide or calcium carbonate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In the milk–carbonate group (12 grams of calcium per day), the mean plasma calcium concentration rose within 24 hours from 10 mg/dL to 11 mg/dL (2.5 to 2.75 mmol/L). In 9 of 20 patients treated for one week, the plasma calcium concentration reached or exceeded 11.3 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) and, in a few cases, exceeded 12 mg/dL (3 mmol/L). The mean plasma bicarbonate concentration rose slightly, but in three of the 20 patients exceeded 31.5 meq/L. The plasma creatinine concentration rose from 1.2 to 1.4 mg/dL (106 to 124 mmol/L) on the third day. The plasma phosphate concentration rose during the first few days. One patient developed the acute milk-alkali syndrome with hypercalcemia preceding the development of renal insufficiency and alkalosis. From this study, it can be concluded that although exposure to excessive calcium and alkali ingestion can cause marked increases in serum Ca and bicarbonate in rare cases, mild intermittent hypercalcemia can be seen in a significant number of patients.\n\n【13】Renal vasoconstriction secondary to hypercalcemia leads to a fall in glomerular filtration rate, and hypercalcemia directly stimulates tubular hydrogen ion secretion and, therefore, bicarbonate reabsorption leading to metabolic alkalosis. The alkalosis helps to maintain hypercalcemia and volume depletion by enhancing the activity of the CaSR and by increasing calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule via the pH-sensitive calcium channel, the transient receptor potential vanilloid member 5 \\[TRPV5\\] 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–19\\]</u>. Volume contraction due to vomiting, diuretics, or the natriuretic effects of hypercalcemia further aggravates hypercalcemia and alkalosis. Marked hypercalcemia can lead to the patient presenting with acute toxicity (nausea, vomiting, weakness, and mental changes with psychosis or depressed sensorium).\n\n【14】After extensive clinical and laboratory evaluation, no evidence of malignant disease or primary hyperparathyroidism was seen in our patient. No cause of hypercalcemia could be identified other than the ingestion of large amount of CaCO<sub>3</sub> (calcium carbonate) with concurrent use of thiazide diuretic. Along with the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia secondary to large calcium intake and absorption as mentioned above, thiazide diuretics are known to reduce urinary calcium excretion and produce mild hypercalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. In the kidney, distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs about 8% of the filtered Ca load. This occurs via epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. In the steady state, the cell must extrude all penetrating Ca, which occurs via a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase and through Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger located on the basolateral surface of the cells of the distal tubule. Thiazides inhibit the Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>−</sup> symport in the early distal convoluted tubule, thus causing a decrease in intracellular Na. This, in turn, enhances the activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, creating an increased driving for Ca resorption through the epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The final effects increased Ca reabsorption leading to hypercalcemia. In a novel study, Nijenhuis et al. showed that mice that lacked active distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption (TRVP5-knockout) developed hypercalcemia with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) treatment and that enhanced passive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport in the proximal tubule rather than active Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport in distal convolution explains thiazide-induced hypocalciuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In conclusion, the ingestion of absorbable calcium, metabolic alkalosis, and concomitant use of thiazide diuretic can produce severe hypercalcemia which can be potentially more life threatening than is generally observed with either agent alone. This must be taken into account while prescribing thiazide diuretics for hypertension to patient with gastric reflux disease due to the ready availability of nonprescription medication containing CaCO<sub>3</sub>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:43:38", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:43:44", "cost": 6.287}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:43:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:43:35"}

He had exhibited a tendency to bleed for the last 16 years and had visited several medical institutions, but no diagnosis had been made. Since the risk of sudden bleeding was assumed to be high due to his age, we decided to examine him in our department. A coagulation abnormality with prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) of 4.5 and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 99.6 seconds was observed, but the platelet count, fibrinogen, and PIVKAII were within normal limits. Coagulation activities of factor V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII were all reduced. Anti-factor VIII and IX antibodies which were measured by the Bethesda method, lupus anti-coagulant (diluted Russell snake venom time method) and anti-cardiolipin antibody were also positive. The results of these tests were comparable to those undertaken 15 years ago when they were scrutinized at the university hospital. We suspected the presence of anti-factor V antibodies because there was a dissociation between the thrombotest values measured and those calculated from the PT-INR. Moreover, cross-mixing test showed an immediate inhibitor pattern. Subsequently, factor V antibodies were confirmed by the immunoblot method and the diagnosis of autoimmune factor V deficiency was made. When factor V, which is downstream of the coagulation cascade, is inhibited, coagulation test using the one-stage clotting method shows a pseudolow value. Therefore, extensive abnormalities of coagulation factor activity and inhibitor assay should be interpreted with caution, and the presence of a high titer of factor V inhibitor should be considered.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Autoimmune coagulation factor deficiency is a hemorrhagic disease caused by the appearance of autoantibodies to coagulation factors and inhibition of their bioactivity. Since a delay in diagnosis and treatment can be life-threatening, accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment are clinically important. Although there are numerous reports on acquired hemophilia caused by a deficiency of factor VIII, reports on other coagulation factor deficiencies are relatively rare.\n\n【4】Here, we report a confirmed case with autoimmune factor V (FV) deficiency diagnosed 16 years after the onset of symptoms, at the age of 70 years. Although the patient had symptoms of bleeding, he had reduced activity of many coagulation factors, which prevented us from identifying the cause of the disease earlier.\n\n【5】##### 1.1. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 70-year-old man presented to our hospital with complaint of right thigh pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a hematoma in the right thigh. We recommended hospitalization, but the patient wanted outpatient treatment with tranexamic acid because he had received the same treatment earlier for this condition. He received hemostatic infusion for three consecutive days in the outpatient clinic, and hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dl from one month ago dropped to 11.3 g/dl on the day of injury and to 7.9 g/dl two days after the injury. However, there was no further progression of anemia and the pain decreased. Therefore, the infusion was stopped on the fourth day.\n\n【7】When we looked at the past medical records, he had presented to our hospital with the principal complaint of persistent subcutaneous hemorrhage at the age of 54 years. He had an abnormal prothrombin time (PT) % of 21.0% and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 99.4 seconds. Consequently, he was referred to two university hospitals but no specific cause could be found. The doctor at the hospital had said, “factor VIII 4.7% and factor IX 0.6% suggest a broad spectrum of coagulation factor abnormalities. Although he had positive lupus anticoagulant (LAC), the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome could not be made. We cannot make a diagnosis, but FFP improves the coagulation activity to some extent, so use it in the event of bleeding.” Subsequently, there were numerous recurrent bleeding events, with major bleeding occurring every two years, such as in the ilium, pelvic cavity, subdural, iliopsoas, brachial muscles, and mediastinum . However, many of these bleeds healed spontaneously within a few days with conservative treatment. For this reason, the patient was given the provisional diagnosis of “circulating anticoagulant factor disorder” at the outpatient clinic of our hospital. Considering the age of the patient, the possibility of additional serious bleeding events was high, and therefore, we decided to examine the patient again.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Major bleeding events that occurred during the course of the disease. 55 years old: intestinal hematoma (a). 59 years old: right glenohumeral and small pelvic cavity hematoma (b). 60 years old: left subacute subdural hematoma and small pelvic cavity hematoma (c). 60 years old: left acute subdural hematoma (d). 63 years old: intramuscular hematoma in the left iliopsoas muscle (e). 67 years old: right brachial intramuscular hematoma (f). 69 years old: intramediastinal hemorrhage (g). 70 years old: right intramuscular hematoma in the right thigh (h). (b)–(h) were light and managed with conservative treatment with tranexamic acid.</u>\n\n【9】He had never undergone a gastroscopy or surgery until the age of 54. He had no history of chronic diseases, such as allergic diseases and collagen diseases. His only regular medication was tranexamic acid. There was no subcutaneous hemorrhaging on physical examination. Blood tests showed a prolonged PT-INR of 4.5, along with aPTT of 99.6 seconds . As reported 16 years ago, coagulation activities of factor V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII were all reduced (1–26.5%). In addition, lupus anticoagulant (diluted Russell snake venom time method) and cardiolipin antibodies were positive, as were anti-factor VIII and IX antibodies by the Bethesda method.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 The main blood test of coagulation system at the university hospital 15 years ago and this visit.</u>\n\n【11】Both PT-INR and aPTT were prolonged, which led us to suspect diseases such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver failure, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, vitamin K deficiency (including due to warfarin), and drugs (heparin, argatroban, and DOAC). However, platelet count, Fib, and proteins induced by vitamin K antagonism (PIVKA) test were within the normal range, and the disease course did not fit these diagnoses.\n\n【12】Therefore, we suspected a deficiency of coagulation factor II, V, and X which are common to the coagulation pathways evaluated by PT and aPTT. We first performed the hepaplastin test (HPT) and thrombotest (TT) to investigate whether the coagulation tests changed with factor V (FV) supplementation . The TT value was 3.7%, while the TT value calculated from PT-INR was 21% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We determined that the patient was FV deficient because of the difference in TT induced by a high-dose of bovine FV supplementation.\n\n【13】Next, we performed a cross-mixing test to determine whether FV deficiency was congenital or acquired. The results showed an immediate type of inhibitory pattern . Incubation at 37°C for 2 hours is required for anti-factor VIII antibody because of its weak inhibitory effect, whereas anti-FV antibody has a strong binding power and does not require incubation. This case also showed an immediate inhibitory response, suggesting the presence of anti-FV antibodies.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Cross-mixing test.</u>\n\n【15】Since anti-FV antibody measurement is a laboratory-level test, we asked other institutions to measure them. As expected, both an immunoblot assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified human plasma FV confirmed the presence of anti-FV autoantibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and he was diagnosed with autoimmune FV deficiency. The plan is to treat him with immunosuppressive drugs in the future.\n\n【16】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【17】FV deficiency is a rare disease and is known to cause major bleeding in some cases, but there are no reported cases with long-term untreated follow-up. Since this case had not been diagnosed earlier, therefore, we were able to obtain the clinical history for the last 16 years. The main feature of this case was that the correct diagnosis could not be made due to the extensive abnormalities found in the coagulation factor activity and inhibitor assays. The underlying reason is that the phenomenon of “pseudodeficiency of multiple coagulation factors” is not well known.\n\n【18】The prevalence of autoimmune FV deficiency is extremely low, at 0.09 cases per million individuals per year, compared with 1.48 cases with autoimmune FVIII deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Primary symptoms differ from hemophilia A in that the majority of the primary symptoms are urologic, gastrointestinal, and respiratory bleeding, and there is little intra-articular bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. While usually asymptomatic, 12–17% patients may have fatal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most cases are idiopathic, but some cases may occur with cancer or collagen disease in the background or after the use of surgical hemostatic agents (e.g. bovine-derived thrombin products) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This case was considered idiopathic because there was no history of previous gastroscopy or surgery. Normally no treatment is necessary. However, in the event of bleeding, treatment with FV supplementation is used as a coping strategy. Although fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is often used, platelet transfusion is also considered useful because of the abundance of coagulation FV in platelet alpha granules.\n\n【19】This case was characterized by the phenomenon of “pseudodeficiency of multiple coagulation factors” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>, and knowledge of the one-stage clotting method, which is also performed in this case, is essential to understand this phenomenon (Suppl). The one-stage clotting method is a PT or aPTT-based assay that is widely used for the measurement of coagulation factor activity and inhibitors due to its simplicity and automation of the measurement system. The coagulation factor activity assay is performed by mixing the target factor-deficient plasma with the patient’s plasma, and the coagulation inhibitor assay is performed by mixing the patient’s plasma with normal plasma, and the resulting plasma is used to measure PT or aPTT. In other words, these assays do not measure the activity of a coagulation factor itself, but rather perform an indirect search for the activity of a coagulation factor by measuring the time at which fibrin is formed (clotting time). Therefore, this assay system cannot detect unexpected abnormalities such as anti-FV antibodies as in our case. In such cases, the clotting time is always prolonged by any coagulation factor activity or inhibitor assay because FV activity, which is downstream of the coagulation cascade, is inhibited by the anti-FV antibody. Dilute Russell’s viper venom time (dRVVT) is always an outlier for the same reason. To prevent “pseudodeficiency of multiple coagulation factors,” the two-step coagulation method, the chromogenic substrate method, and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) method are available, but they are not widely used because of their complexity.\n\n【20】The diagnosis in this case was made by a traditional assay called TT and HPT (Suppl). This assay confirms the activity of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors by adding the coagulation factor other than II, VII, and X (created by absorbing the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors with barium sulfate) and the activator to patient plasma. The activator is thromboplastin, differentiated by the fact that TT is bovine and HPT is of rabbit origin. The usefulness of this test for determining FV deficiency has been reported in the past 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Furthermore, the present case was positive for cardiolipin antibodies, which are also found in other cases of acquired FV inhibition, suggesting a common mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The assay system for detecting cardiolipin antibodies is the indirect ELISA (Suppl). The indirect ELISA measures not only anti-cardiolipin antibodies that bind to cardiolipin but also antibodies to plasma proteins that bind to cardiolipin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Since FV is known to attach to phospholipids via the C2 domain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, this finding should not indicate the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and is considered false positive. However, this is only conjecture and essentially requires direct proof by immunoprecipitation.\n\n【22】In conclusion, we have described a case of autoimmune FV deficiency that went undiagnosed for 16 years due to “pseudodeficiency of multiple coagulation factors.” Autoimmune FV deficiency requires early diagnosis and treatment because of the life-threatening bleeding that may occur once every two years. When, as in the present case, extensive abnormalities of the coagulation factor activity and inhibitor assays are found, the presence of a high titer of FV inhibitor should be considered and the laboratory values should be interpreted carefully. In such a case, diagnosis using TT and HPT is considered useful.\n\n【23】Both PT and aPTT showed an inhibitor pattern. In addition, unlike anti-factor VIII antibody, there was little change after 2 hours of incubation because it showed an immediate type of reaction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:04:55", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:05:50", "cost": 55.189}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:05:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:04:55"}

We report two rare cases of biliary obstruction by pseudolithiasis shortly after completing CTRX treatment. Stones and sludge, which had not been detected before CTRX administration, appeared in the gallbladder and common bile duct and led to biliary obstruction and acute cholangitis. The obstructions were successfully treated with endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage and endoscopic sphincterotomy. CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis has been reported mainly in children and adolescents but is also seen in adults with similar incidence rate. Although CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis is usually asymptomatic and disappears spontaneously after discontinuing the drug, some patients develop biliary obstruction.

In some cases, CTRX is known to precipitate with calcium ion in the biliary tract. The precipitation usually disappears after discontinuation of CTRX and is thus called biliary pseudolithiasis.

Case Presentation\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 91-year-old woman with stage 5 chronic kidney disease possibly due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis or chronic glomerulonephritis was admitted to the Department of Nephrology of our hospital because of a 2-week history of dyspnea. Physical examination on admission was not remarkable except for oxygen saturation of 91% on 2 L/min of oxygen and pretibial pitting edema. Laboratory examinations showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 5,300/μL (reference range (RR): 3,300–8,600), C-reactive protein (CRP) 2.17 mg/dL (RR: 0–0.14), blood urea nitrogen 80.3 mg/dL (RR: 8.0–20.0), serum creatinine 5.69 mg/dL (RR: 0.46–0.79), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 24 U/L (RR: 13–30), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 9 U/L (RR: 7–23), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 276 mg/dL (RR: 124–222), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 326 U/L (RR: 103–322), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) 42 U/L (RR: 9–32), total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL (RR: 0.4–1.5), and serum amylase 104 U/L (RR: 44–132). Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed ground-glass appearance of the bilateral lung field and consolidations of the right middle lobe and left lower lobe. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary edema and pneumonia and was treated with 2 g of CTRX intravenously every 24 hours for 10 days along with intravenous furosemide. Three days after ending the administration of CTRX, she complained of right upper abdominal pain. Laboratory data demonstrated worsening of the liver function: AST 232 U/L, ALT 46 U/L, LDH 481 mg/dL, ALP 866 U/L, γ-GTP 167 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, and serum amylase 115 U/L.

A diagnosis of grade II cholangitis due to CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis was made, and the patient was referred to the Department of Internal Medicine. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) demonstrated the absence of bile excretion from the ampulla of Vater, indicating bile congestion by obstruction of the common bile duct . Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) by inserting a biliary stent resulted in excretion of the bile , and cholangitis resolved after the procedure.

Case 2\n\n【11】An 82-year-old woman visited the hospital because of diarrhea and mild abdominal pain in the umbilical region. She had a medical history of dermatomyositis, interstitial pneumonitis, diabetes mellitus, and chronic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction and a relatively low left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and was receiving 9 mg of prednisolone and 2 mg of tacrolimus. A diagnosis of acute enteritis was made. In addition to fasting and intravenous hydration, she was treated with 2 g of intravenous CTRX every 24 hours for 5 days, and subsequently with oral levofloxacin at 500 mg once daily for 5 days after campylobacter had been cultured from the stool obtained on admission. She recovered fully and was discharged on day 13. Two days after discharge, she complained of severe upper abdominal pain and back pain. Laboratory data showed leukocytosis (WBC count 14,000/μL), elevation of CRP (1.42 mg/dL), mild liver dysfunction (AST 47 U/L, ALT 18 U/L, LDH 235 U/L, ALP 233 U/L, γ-GTP 73 U/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL), and elevations of serum amylase (938 U/L) and lipase (4113 U/L, RR: 12–52). CT scan revealed small stones and sludge in the gallbladder and common bile duct, which had not been detected two weeks earlier . She was diagnosed with grade II acute cholangitis and grade 1 acute pancreatitis. Emergent ERC showed deposition of white sludge on the ampulla of Vater and absence of bile excretion . Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and ERBD were performed, resulting in excretion of the bile  and resolution of the abdominal pain. Hydration required for the treatment of acute pancreatitis exacerbated the heart failure, making the treatment of acute pancreatitis difficult. The patient developed multiple organ failure and died on day 17.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 CT scans in Case 2.

Discussion\n\n【15】We experienced two cases of common bile duct stones and sludge causing acute cholangitis shortly after completing CTRX treatment, which required endoscopic managements. Acute pancreatitis was also seen in Case 2. In both cases, biliary stones or sludge had not been detected in the CT scan 2 weeks before the onset. In Case 1, the stones and sludge spontaneously disappeared 4 weeks later. The white fine precipitation observed in Case 2 was different from the appearance of ordinary biliary stones consisting mainly of cholesterol or bilirubin. These observations strongly indicated that CTRX induced the biliary stones and sludge. Previous studies demonstrated that intravenously administered CTRX is excreted to the bile as a divalent anion and can precipitate with calcium ion to form calcium-CTRX complex at a dose of 2 g or higher 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5–8\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Cases of pseudolithiasis have been reported mainly in children and adolescents with an incidence of 17–57% after CTRX administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–14\\]</u>. In most cases, biliary pseudolithiasis was detected between 3 and 14 days after initiating CTRX administration and completely resolved within a few weeks after discontinuing CTRX. Biliary symptoms, such as right upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, were reported in 0–20% of these cases. Although the CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis is less well studied in adults, the clinical features including the incidence rate are similar to those for children and adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Interventional procedures are required in some cases of CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis when the stones or sludge induce biliary obstruction, leading to acute cholangitis or acute pancreatitis as in our cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 17–20\\]</u>. Endoscopic procedures, such as EST and/or ERBD, are the treatment of choice in such cases because they are less invasive than surgical procedures. Most of the previous reports performed surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 17–19\\]</u>, and there is only one case report in the English literature which reported endoscopic management for CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Because discontinuation of CTRX usually leads to spontaneous resolution of biliary pseudolithiasis, we believe that cholecystectomy should be considered only when biliary obstruction persists even after discontinuing the drug and endoscopic managements are difficult. This point is supported by a case of an 18-month-old boy with CTRX-induced cholecystitis, where stones in the gallbladder detected during CTRX administration were not found in the gallbladder resected 9 days after discontinuing the drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis is usually asymptomatic and disappears spontaneously after discontinuation of the drug, making the complication easily overlooked especially in adults. However, some patients develop biliary obstruction requiring emergent procedures, and thus caution is necessary during CTRX administration. Once biliary obstruction occurs, endoscopic managements such as EST and ERBD should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:14:53", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:15:39", "cost": 45.686}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:15:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:14:52"}

He was treated with complete androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) attaining biochemical complete response that lasted for 2 years. Subsequently, he received sipuleucel-T on a clinical trial demonstrating stable disease radiographically for 18 months. Radiographic and biochemical progression necessitated treatment with lenalidomide on a phase II clinical trial. In total, he received 4.5 months of lenalidomide achieving partial biochemical response and stable disease radiographically. However, lenalidomide was discontinued 3 months prior to presentation due to shortness of breath and fatigue attributed initially to the study drug. Pulmonary function testing at that time showed a restrictive pattern and cardiac evaluation was nonrevealing.

This case report presents a patient with PWS with morbid obesity, severe OSA, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome admitted to the hospital for hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure.

Introduction\n\n【3】Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) has a prevalence of about 1/15,000 people and is the most common syndromic form of obesity. The syndrome is caused by lack of expression of the long arm on chromosome 15, specifically 15q11.2-q13, with 65–75% of the cases associated with paternal deletion of this chromosomal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】PWS is characterized by a multitude of features that occur from early childhood to adolescence, with one of the primary findings being the development of obesity during early childhood in the setting of hyperphagia. Because of this, there is a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Adenotonsillectomy is the primary treatment for OSA in pediatric patients; if unsuccessful, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. If CPAP and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) fail, tracheostomy is a treatment option of last resort. This case report presents a patient with PWS with morbid obesity, severe OSA, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) who was admitted for hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. NIV with average volume-assured pressure support with auto-titrating end expiratory airway pressure (EPAP), (AVAPS-AE), a newer NIV modality, successfully treated the hypoventilation during the hospitalization and after discharge.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 6-year-old boy with past medical history of PWS, hypotonia, mild developmental delay, and early onset thoracic scoliosis treated with posterior spinal growing rod placement presented with a 2-year history of loud snoring. He underwent in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG), which showed severe OSA, with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 133.7 events/hour. The patient was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and placed on CPAP 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with clinical improvement. He was started on home CPAP and underwent an in-laboratory CPAP titration in which the AHI improved to 1.2 events/hour with nasal CPAP 14 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. After that, the patient underwent surgical intervention with a combined uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and adenotonsillectomy. Postoperative PSG showed improved but persistent severe OSA with residual AHI 37 events/hour. The patient did not attend postsurgery CPAP titration study and was noted to have poor CPAP compliance over the next 2 years, after which he was lost to follow up.\n\n【7】At age 11, the patient presented to the hospital emergency room with a 2-day history of fatigue, headache, lethargy, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and swelling in the abdomen and lower extremities. His sister had symptoms consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection. On presentation, he had severe hypoxia, SpO<sub>2</sub> 50% on room air, and was placed on oxygen via non-rebreather mask 15 L/min with improvement in SpO<sub>2</sub> to 98%. Temperature was 36.8°C, blood pressure 167/95 mm·Hg, heart rate 105 beats/minute, respiratory rate 55 breaths/minute, height 1.42 m, weight 107 kg, and body mass index (BMI) 53.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (>99<sup>th</sup> percentile). He had no known history of associated cardiac or endocrine disorders and was on no medications at home. On physical exam, the patient was awake, alert, oriented, and in severe respiratory distress. There were nasal flaring, subcoastal retractions, decreased air movement with diffuse coarse rhonchi and crackles on lung auscultation, tachycardia, generalized abdominal tenderness, and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Attempts to transition to oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min were unsuccessful due to oxygen desaturation to 79%. He was switched to high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 15 L/min and FiO<sub>2</sub> 80%. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary airspace opacities . Admission laboratory results were significant for white blood cell count 20.7 L/mcL, NT-proBNP 1466 pg/mL, troponin 0.08 ng/mL, and venous blood gas (VBG) with pH 7.34, PCO<sub>2</sub> 73 mm·Hg, and PO<sub>2</sub> 40 mm·Hg. A complete respiratory viral panel and SARS-CoV-2 testing with polymerase chain reaction were negative.

He also received deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Serial troponins peaked to 0.09 ng/mL before decreasing to <0.02 ng/mL. An echocardiogram showed normal biventricular function, with right ventricular pressures estimated to be half of systemic arterial pressures, suggestive of right heart strain and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was treated with daytime HFNC oxygen and nocturnal NIV with bilevel PAP with a Respironics V60 ventilator (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA), with settings of inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and EPAP 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, with FiO<sub>2</sub> 50%. On day 2 of admission the VBG improved, with pH 7.39 and PCO<sub>2</sub> 63 mm·Hg and the volume status also improved with diuresis. The VBG remained stable on day 3 with pH 7.37 and pCO<sub>2</sub> 67 mm·Hg, and the patient was transitioned to CPAP 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with FiO<sub>2</sub> 40%. He did not tolerate CPAP that night and later bilevel PAP 16/6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O due to discomfort, increased work of breathing and continued hypercapnia with both, with worsening VBG to pH 7.33 and pCO<sub>2</sub> 86 mm·Hg on day 4. To avoid intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation, the patient was placed on continuous NIV with AVAPS, a mode of noninvasive ventilation previously used successfully in a pediatric patient at our institution. Initial settings were target tidal volume, (VT) 350 mL (8 mL/kg), EPAP 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, IPAP 15–25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, FiO<sub>2</sub> 30%, respiratory rate 15 breaths/minute, inspiratory time 1 second, rise time 1. AVAPS was used and well tolerated by the patient and the next day, there was significant improvement in gas exchange, with weaning of FiO<sub>2</sub> to 21% on the NIV, and VBG showing pH 7.36 and pCO<sub>2</sub> 41 mm·Hg. Over the course of the next 5 days, the patient’s volume and respiratory status continued to improve. He was switched from continuous to nocturnal NIV and daytime oxygen was discontinued. On day 10 of admission, the VBG was pH 7.35 and pCO<sub>2</sub> 56 mm Hg and weight was 101.7 kg (net loss 5.3 kg). The patient was discharged home that day on nocturnal NIV with a Trilogy ventilator (Philips Respironics) on the following settings: AVAPS-AE, target VT 350 ml, EPAP 6–10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, pressure support 5–15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, respiratory rate 15 breaths/minute, inspiratory time 0.8 seconds, rise time 3, and FiO<sub>2</sub> 21%.\n\n【10】The patient has had a total of four outpatient follow-up visits over 8 months since his discharge and is doing clinically well without hospital readmissions. He has tolerated nocturnal NIV and uses it regularly. His ventilator download data over the most recent 30 days showed excellent compliance, with 93% of days used, with average daily use 6.9 hours, average VT 400 ml, average respiratory rate 21 breaths/minute, and average minute ventilation 8.4 L/min. The patient also lost 4.5 kg during that period. Overall treatment course is focused on maintaining compliance to NIV therapy, as well as weight loss goals, managing symptoms of hyperphagia, and overall treatment of PWS.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】This case highlights the potential therapeutic value of NIV with auto-titrating IPAP and EPAP to treat severe OSA with OHS and hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with PWS. In patients with OSA, surgical intervention is typically the first choice for therapy, and CPAP is recommended for those that fail surgery. In patients with PWS, however, adenotonsillectomy may cause velopharyngeal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, and therefore, PAP therapy may be superior.\n\n【13】Obesity affects 14 million children in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, and OSA has an estimated prevalence of 1.2% to 5.7% of children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The current mainstay treatment of OSA is adenotonsillectomy and if needed, CPAP therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The combination of severe OSA with morbid obesity reduces the benefit of upper airway therapy, and the frequency of perioperative airway complications is also 13% higher (15% vs 2.0%) in severely obese children who undergo tonsillectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. With the obesity epidemic, rates of treatment failures with surgical intervention and traditional PAP therapy may increase and consideration of alternatives is important. NIV therapy may be a treatment option in severe cases of OSA when other therapies fail to avoid surgical interventions of last resort such as tracheostomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Patients with PWS are at higher risk for sleep disordered breathing due to various reasons including obesity, craniofacial features, and hypotonia. In fact, the prevalence of OSA in PWS is 80%, which is much greater than in the general pediatric population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is a primary contributor to pediatric OSA, but it may also be present as a side effect of growth hormone treatment in PWS. Though the obstructive aspects of sleep apnea may be explained, the etiology of higher prevalence of central sleep apnea in this population is unknown at this time. Patients with PWS have abnormal ventilator control during sleep, higher arousal threshold for hypercapnia, reduced ventilatory response, and limited arousal response to hypoxia. A combination of these factors would indicate a significant risk for sleep-related hypoxia and hypoventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8\\]</u>. In fact, it is common to the PWS phenotype to present with nocturnal hypoventilation, which is not typical for most other patients with OSA, and this may occur without central or obstructive sleep apnea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. On NIV with AVAPS-AE, respiratory failure with hypoxemia and hypercapnia can resolve, as in the case of our patient. In addition, this case showcases the potential of maintaining long-term stability as an outpatient with this treatment modality with appropriate compliance, thus avoiding further hospital admissions and other surgical interventions like a tracheostomy.\n\n【15】CPAP therapy is a type of conventional OSA treatment that provides a constant flow of gas at a predetermined pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. AVAPS is a mode of NIV with IPAP that targets a goal VT based on ideal body weight to treat hypoventilation. The spontaneous respiratory flow is monitored, and the ventilator adjusts the IPAP within a set range to maintain the target VT. AVAPS-AE adds auto-titrating EPAP to treat comorbid OSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Due to the novelty of the mode and its recent introduction to the pediatric population, there are limited data on AVAPS therapy as a treatment modality for hypoventilation in children, with mostly case reports published despite increasing interest and use over time. We have previously shown AVAPS to be effective in treating very severe OSA and nocturnal hypoventilation in a child both in the sleep laboratory and long term as outpatient avoiding the need for tracheostomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This modality has also been used successfully in a group of 45 adult patients with OSA who failed a prior CPAP titration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The largest case series of AVAPS use in the pediatric population was published in 2021 and included 19 patients with nocturnal hypoventilation due to multiple medical conditions who had failed a bilevel PAP titration in the sleep laboratory due to persistent hypoventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. AVAPS titration was shown to be more effective than conventional bilevel PAP titration in decreasing nocturnal transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> levels. This case series included a 12-year-old patient with PWS, the only patient with morbid obesity in the group. To our knowledge, this is the only previous report of use of this NIV modality in PWS. In our case, we document the effectiveness of AVAPS therapy during an inpatient admission for cardiorespiratory failure and for long-term use while outpatient.\n\n【17】In conclusion, we report on the successful use of NIV with AVAPS in treating severe OSA, OHS, and cardiorespiratory failure in a pediatric patient with morbid obesity and PWS, both in inpatient and outpatient settings when other NIV modalities failed. A trial of this NIV modality may be considered in pediatrics as a treatment option in complicated or refractory cases of severe OSA and OHS with associated severe gas exchange abnormalities prior to the use of invasive ventilation. More studies need to be done to clarify the therapeutic role of this NIV modality in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:34", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:55:40", "cost": 66.631}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:55:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:33"}

Both patients reported black cohosh use for at least six months and had no evidence of another cause of liver disease. Their liver biopsies showed a component of centrilobular necrosis consistent with severe drug-induced liver injury. In addition, the biopsies showed characteristics of autoimmune-like liver injury with an interface hepatitis dominated by plasma cells. Although serum markers for autoimmune hepatitis were not particularly elevated, both patients responded to corticosteroids, supporting an immune-mediated component to the liver injury.

On physical examination, she had mild icterus and no stigmata of chronic liver disease. Her only comorbidity was hypothyroidism. Her medications included black cohosh, which she was taking for 6 months, and levothyroxine 0.05 mg daily. She discontinued black cohosh when her symptoms began. She had no family history of liver or autoimmune disease. She denied any alcohol or drug use. Her total bilirubin level was 3.1 mg/dL (normal 0.8–1.2), alanine transaminase (ALT) 1457 U/L (normal 5–40), aspartate transaminase (AST) 696 U/L (normal 10–40), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 94 U/L (normal 30–120 U/L), and international normalized ratio (INR) 1.2 (normal 0.8–1.2). Further laboratories showed no serological evidence of active hepatitis A, B, or C infection. Serological titers for acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) were negative. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was 1 : 40 and smooth muscle antibody was modestly elevated at 1 : 80. Serum iron was 169  g/dL (normal: 50 to 170  g/dL for women), ferritin was 642 ng/dL (normal: 15–200 ng/mL for females), and hemochromatosis gene analysis was negative. Ceruloplasmin was in the normal range.  \nFour months after her initial presentation, the liver enzymes remained elevated with an ALT of 334 U/L, AST 229 U/L, and a total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL. A liver biopsy was performed which prompted a referral to the liver center at the University of Illinois. The liver biopsy was remarkable for necrosis around terminal hepatic venules, lobular disarray, mild ballooning, apoptosis, Kupffer cell reactivity, mild cholangiolar proliferation, and interface hepatitis remarkable for numerous plasma cells and eosinophils. A repeat antismooth muscle antibody was normal at 1 : 20. Prednisone treatment was initiated. A follow-up liver biopsy was performed after three months. At this time, the liver histology demonstrated chronic hepatitis with fibroinflammatory expansion of portal tracts by moderate plasma cell rich interface hepatitis, rare periportal hepatocyte apoptosis, and mild cholangiolar proliferation . The patient was started on azathioprine. Her liver enzymes returned to normal values within five months with an ALT of 30 U/L, AST of 29 U/L, ALP 36 U/L, and a total bilirubin of 0.9 mg/dL. A repeat liver biopsy after fifteen months showed marked improvement with only minimal portal lymphocytes and no other significant histopathological changes. The liver function test values remained normal at 15 months and at 40 months following the acute episode. The clinicopathological features of Case 1 are illustrated in Tables 1, 2, and 3.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Current case studies: clinical features and medications.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Current case studies: past medical history, serological tests, and other pertinent laboratory data.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 Duration of Illness and black cohosh use, liver function tests, autoimmune markers, histology, and treatment.</u>\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | This liver biopsy from Case 1 displays chronic hepatitis remarkable for its dense interface activity with cholangiolar proliferation (1a) (×200) and sheets of plasma cells and apoptosis (1b) (×600). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】Case 2. A 53-years-old woman presented to our liver center for evaluation of elevated liver enzymes detected at a health screening fair four months earlier. She had no risk factors for viral hepatitis, no family history of liver disease, and denied any alcohol consumption. Although she was initially asymptomatic, she developed right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, and lower extremity edema by the time of her presentation. Her medical history was remarkable only for irritable bowel syndrome. Her medications within the past year included dicyclomine for abdominal cramps as needed, an herbal supplement which contains soy protein and black cohosh for menopausal symptoms, and occasional over the counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain. She discontinued these medications on the advice of her primary care physician. Laboratories showed a total bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dL, ALT 443 U/L, AST 478 U/L, ALP 188 U/L, and an INR of 2.0. Other notable laboratory values included negative serological evidence of active hepatitis A, B, and C viral infection, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR, iron 137  g/dL, ferritin 1527 ng/mL, negative hemochromatosis gene analysis, and nonsignificant ceruloplasmin level. Serological tests for antinuclear, antismooth muscle, antiliver kidney microsomal, and antimitochondrial antibodies were negative. An ultrasound demonstrated patent portal and hepatic veins and a normal appearing liver. Her liver biopsy was remarkable for centrilobular necrosis with moderate cholangiolar proliferation and plasma cell rich interface and lobular hepatitis.  \nThe patient was started on 40 mg of prednisone daily. Liver function test values improved to a total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL, ALT of 60 U/L, AST 50 U/L, and ALP 153 U/L after two weeks and normalized after five weeks of therapy. The clinicopathological features of Case 2 are illustrated in Tables 1, 2, and 4.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 4 Duration of Illness and black cohosh use, liver function tests, autoimmune markers and histology.</u>\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Application of the Naranjo Causality Score for Adverse Drug Reactions\n\n【14】The Naranjo causality score for adverse drug reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> was applied to the cases described here. As shown in Table 5, the current case studies individually achieved a Naranjo score of 3 and were both categorized as “possible adverse drug reaction”, in a scale encompassing a minimum score of zero, or “doubtful adverse drug reaction” to a maximum score of 9, or “definite adverse drug reaction.”\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 5 Naranjo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> Causality Scale for Adverse Drug Reactions.</u>\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Application of the Hennes-Simplified Criteria for Diagnosis of Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH)\n\n【17】While the current case studies showed histopathological features of autoimmune hepatitis, neither fulfilled a diagnosis of “probable AIH” or “definite AIH” based on the Hennes simplified criteria for diagnosis of AIH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Briefly, Case 1 had an ANA titer of up to 1 : 80 (score 2), no available immunoglobulin titers (no score), a liver histology compatible with AIH (score 1), and absence of viral hepatitis (score 2), with a total score of 5. Case 2 had a score of 1-0-1-2 4, on a scale where a score of 6 was designated “probable AIH”, and 7 as “definite AIH.”\n\n【18】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Botanical dietary supplements are used commonly in the United States and are generally perceived to be safe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In one study, nearly one half of persons reported use of at least one agent to their primary provider 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. A major difficulty in studying black cohosh is uncertainty regarding the composition of the various black cohosh products. Black cohosh itself contains a number of secondary compounds including phenolic derivatives and triterpene glycosides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Phytoestrogens were postulated to play a role in black cohosh binding to estrogen receptors, but the presence of these compounds is controversial. In one study, chromatographic analysis of 11 commercial black cohosh products showed that three were actually Asian Actea species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. An analysis of the remaining eight products found variability in the composition of triterpene glycosides and phenolic constituents. More importantly, not a single product contained a phytoestrogen. Thus, the mechanism by which black cohosh might impact on alleviating menopausal symptoms is not well understood. Other possibilities include binding to yet-to-be-defined receptors or effects on the central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Whether black cohosh is effective in controlling vasomotor symptoms of menopause is controversial as well. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology included black cohosh as a possible remedy for the vasomotor symptoms of menopause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. A large randomized-blinded trial of one-year duration found no difference between black cohosh and placebo in controlling vasomotor symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Moreover, a recent review did not recommend long-term use due to the absence of safety evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【20】There are a growing number of case reports of hepatotoxicity in patients taking black cohosh  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. Most described acute hepatic necrosis, although three articles of them detailed a case with clinical features of autoimmune hepatitis after black cohosh use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 5\\]</u>. The clinicopathological features of the cases in the current series have a fascinating combination of findings. Both patients presented with an acute hepatitis displaying prominent centrilobular necrosis consistent with severe drug-induced liver injury. While autoantibodies were low titer or absent, the histology showed characteristics of autoimmune hepatitis with a plasma cell rich interface and lobular hepatitis. In addition, both patients responded to corticosteroids, supporting an immune mediated component to the liver injury.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 6 Similarities and differences among current case studies and published cases of black cohosh hepatotoxicity.</u>\n\n【22】Determining the risk of black cohosh hepatotoxicity is further complicated by variability in both dosage and number of other botanical herbal supplements contained in some preparations. As an example, in the case reported by Lontos 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, the preparation of black cohosh included 4 other botanicals: ground ivy, golden seal, gingko, and oat seeds. While liver injury remains unreported with the use of the last 3 botanicals, ground ivy contains a known hepatotoxin, pulegone. This case culminated in liver failure despite discontinuation of the herbal supplement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Drug interactions might further potentiate negative outcomes resulting from hepatoxicity due to herbal supplements. That subjects in 3 of 5 reported cases of autoimmune-like liver injury following consumption of black cohosh  also had concomitant intake of synthetic thyroid hormone, levothyroxine, merits attention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>. Herbal supplements such as venencapsan and black cohosh, and prescription drugs specifically rosiglitazone, ritonavir, and valproic acid, have had reported drug interactions with levothyroxine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9, 18–22\\]</u>.\n\n【24】A 2008 review by Mahady assigned all known case reports of black cohosh-induced liver injury under the category of “possible causality” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. As earlier stated, both cases of the current study were also assigned “possible causality” by Naranjo scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Although no clinical or animal pharmacokinetic or toxicological information were identified in the Mahady review, it led to the inclusion of a cautionary statement on black cohosh products which was not previously required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Despite such development, the use of botanical dietary supplements is generally viewed by the public as safe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Providers are encouraged to screen patients about their consumption of botanical herbal supplements and to assess for any evidence of liver injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Timely discontinuation of hepatotoxic agents and, in some cases, early initiation of immunotherapy might prevent significant liver injury or could even be life saving 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The validity of reported cases of liver injury due to black cohosh illustrated in Table 6 has been disputed. Concerns that led to this uncertainty included cases in which the timing of liver injury occurred at a relatively short interval following exposure to black cohosh 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 7\\]</u>, presence of comorbidities such as cholelithhiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> or concomittant use of drugs other than black cohosh that could have potentially triggered the adverse drug reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4, 7\\]</u>, or the notion that some of the reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, including Case 1 of the current study (also reported by Mahady 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>), were indeed examples of autoimmune hepatitis rather than adverse drug reactions. Nonetheless, application of the Naranjo causality score to these case reports found possible cause for adverse drug reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Further, autoimmune hepatitis is one of the known outcomes of drug-induced liver injury. The immune mechanism is precipitated by a drug or a metabolite acting as a hapten covalently binding to host cellular protein, converting into an immunogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and thereby eliciting an autoimmune response. Outcomes illustrating an association of chronic hepatitis with autoimmune features developing following the use of the botanical supplement black cohosh need to be emphasized.\n\n【26】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【27】Here we described two cases of liver injury following the use of black cohosh characterized by chronic hepatitis with centrilobular necrosis and an interface activity dominated by plasma cells. While the histopathology in both cases was compatible with autoimmune hepatitis, clinical evidence for an autoimmune etiology was lacking. Nonetheless both cases improved upon withdrawal of the drug and immunosuppressive therapy, indicating that there was at least in part a drug-induced immunological basis to the liver injury.\n\n【28】The current case studies, and three other published cases of liver injury following the use of black cohosh, share similar histological characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 5\\]</u>. Hepatic manifestations following the use of black cohosh should therefore be added to the list of differential diagnoses of hepatic necrosis culminating in chronic hepatitis mimicking autoimmune hepatitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:34:58", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:35:16", "cost": 17.968}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:35:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:34:58"}

Coronavirus infection is a risk factor for vascular thrombosis. This is of particular importance for patients undergoing myocardial revascularization since this infection can be a trigger for the formation of restenosis in the area of a previously implanted coronary stent. Understanding the risk factors for stent thrombosis and restenosis is of particular importance in individuals at risk for adverse outcomes. The rarity of such situations makes the present study unique. Objective. Studying the peculiarities of restenosis and thrombosis of the coronary arteries in patients after coronavirus infection. Methods. The study was performed in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Emergency Hospital, Semey City, in 2021. We have examined the medical records of 10 consecutive patients with restenosis of coronary arteries after coronavirus infection and 10 matched-by-age patients with similar restenosis of coronary arteries who did not have coronavirus infection as a comparison group. To determine statistically significant differences between independent samples, we calculated the Mann–Whitney U test. Results. The average age of patients was 65.7 years. Only one case was classified as early restenosis (within 8 days of previous revascularization), two cases represented late restenosis, and seven cases were very late restenoses. In 70% of cases, restenosis was localized in the left anterior descending artery, in 30% of cases, it was in the right coronary artery, and in 40% of cases, it was in the left circumflex artery. In comparison with patients who did not have a coronavirus infection, there were statistically significant differences regarding IgG  and fibrinogen . Conclusion. Patients with myocardial revascularization in the past have a higher risk of stent restenosis against the background of coronavirus infection due to excessive neointimal hyperplasia, hypercoagulability, increased inflammatory response, and endothelial dysfunction.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The gold standard for the treatment of coronary artery disease is myocardial revascularization using stents, balloon angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass grafting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Advances in myocardial revascularization, the introduction of drug-eluting stents, and effective antithrombotic therapy have made coronary restenosis rare in recent years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed our point of view about this pathology. This infection promotes thrombosis of arterial vessels and acts as a provoking factor in the development of acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the high burden on the healthcare system and the sharply increased need for resources, the activity of interventional cardiology around the world decreased significantly, reducing the number of cardiac catheterization procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, the need for repeated cardiac surgery for restenosis of coronary vessels increased against the background of coronavirus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Understanding the risk factors for stent thrombosis and restenosis is of particular importance in individuals at risk for adverse outcomes, especially in elderly patients with associated diseases.\n\n【5】##### 1.1. Aim of Research\n\n【6】Studying the peculiarities of restenosis and thrombosis of the coronary arteries in patients after coronavirus infection.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Methods\n\n【8】The study was performed in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Emergency Hospital, Semey City, Kazakhstan, from May 2021 to December 2021. We have examined the medical records of ten consecutive patients with restenosis of coronary arteries after coronavirus infection and ten matched-by-age patients with a similar restenosis of coronary arteries who did not have coronavirus infection as a comparison group. In all patients during restenosis, stents of the third generation were installed (Resolute Integrity, Promus Premier, Xience Alpine, BioMatrix, and Orsiro). The clinical data of patients were collected from electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical symptoms and signs, coexisting conditions, imaging findings, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes. Data on previous myocardial revascularization and coronavirus infection were found retrospectively from medical records. For all patients, the diagnosis was made by experienced specialists. All reported events were verified by hospital electronic records from Complex Medical Information System and adjudicated by two cardiologists in consensus. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013) and approved by the institutional ethical committee of Semey Medical University (reference number 7 from 16.03.2021). Informed consent and permission to publish were provided by the patients.\n\n【9】The study design is prospective single-center case series. To determine statistically significant differences between independent samples, we calculated the Mann–Whitney U\\-test.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【11】Case 1.

CABG to RCA is occluded.  \nAfter predilation, drug-eluting stents were implanted in all patients in the stenosis zone. At the control angiography: the lumen of the arteries was restored and the blood flow through the artery was TIMI III flow.  \nClinical characteristics and data of instrumental examination of persons with restenosis who underwent COVID-19 and comparison group are presented in Table 1. The average age of the studied patients was 65.7 years (from 46 to 80 years); in the comparison group, it was 66.2 years. All patients of the studied group were hospitalized for acute coronary artery disease requiring myocardial revascularization; seven of them had STEMI and three had NSTEMI (diagnosis confirmed by ECG), in comparison group situation was the same. Acute coronavirus infection (CVI) was observed only in two patients out of 10 cases (Cases 4 and 7); in one of them, severe COVID-associated pneumonia was diagnosed with a fatal outcome caused by acute heart failure. The second patient had a repeated case of CVI with an interval of 11 months after previous COVID-associated pneumonia against the background of pulmonary fibrosis and chronic respiratory failure of the III degrees, requiring constant oxygen support. The rest of the patients underwent CVI for the previous period from one month (Cases 1 and 9) to 8 months; infection was confirmed by elevated IgG levels .  \nSigns of acute respiratory failure, accompanied by a decrease in oxygen saturation, tachycardia, and tachypnea, were observed in six patients in the studied group. All patients of the studied group received oxygen support. Signs of respiratory distress syndrome were noted in two patients. In the comparison group, decreased oxygen saturation was found in three patients; however this rate was not less than 95%. There were no statistically significant differences in this indicator in the studied groups .  \nPrevious myocardial revascularization in the studied group was carried out in terms of 8 days (Case 6) to 14 years. In three patients, the ejection fraction according to echocardiography was intact; in three patients, it was moderately reduced; in the remaining patients, it was decreased. In all cases, restenosis of the coronary arteries was observed; in most cases, its localization was the LAD; in three cases, it was RCA; in four cases, it was LCx. In the comparison group, the predominant localization was LAD (five cases), and in four cases, it was RCA. Decreased injection fraction in this group was found in five cases. There were no statistically significant differences in this rate in the studied groups . In all cases, the underlying disease was accompanied by hypertension, and 40% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus.  \nAnalyzing laboratory parameters, all persons of the studied group had confirmation of a past coronavirus infection in accordance with the levels of IgM and IgG . In comparison with patients who did not have a coronavirus infection, there were no statistically significant differences regarding IgM (the rate of acute infection); however, such differences were found for IgG (indicator of CVI in the history) (; respectively).  \nLymphopenia and thrombocytopenia characteristic of CVI were noted only in the case of a deceased patient (Case 4); he also had a pronounced leukocytosis, indicating the addition of a bacterial infection. In three cases, moderate leukocytosis was noted against the background of high levels of cardiac markers. A high D-dimer was found only in two cases (one case of acute CVI, the second in a patient who had CVI three months ago). With regard to the lipid profile, almost all patients showed a tendency to increase LDL levels to the upper limit of normal values, while HDL levels were at or below the lower limit of normal. There were not any statistically significant differences in the studied and comparison groups regarding these biochemical rates; however, for the fibrinogen level, such differences were significant .\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Clinical characteristics and data of instrumental examination of persons with restenosis who underwent CVI.</u>\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Laboratory indicators characterizing the presence of recurrent stent thrombosis in persons who underwent CVI.</u>\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Restenosis is angiographically confirmed a narrowing of the lumen of the coronary artery by more than 50%, localized in the area of a previously implanted stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Most often, restenosis develops within the first three months after previous revascularization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. After six months, the risks of restenosis decrease and the process remains stable; since during this period, stent endothelization and remodeling of the coronary artery wall are completed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The mechanism for early restenosis development is associated with trauma to the vascular wall during device implantation, leading to an inflammatory response accompanied by the migration of neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, and the release of inflammatory mediators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Subsequently, the induction of migration of smooth muscle cells into the intima of the vessel with their accumulation and proliferation of fibroblasts is observed. Increased synthesis of the extracellular matrix causes thickening of the neoadventitia and neointima, narrowing the lumen of the coronary artery in the area of the preimplanted stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Thus, there is a direct relationship between the development of inflammation, the formation of neointima, and the development of restenosis at the site of the implanted stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. After the damage to the intima of the coronary artery by a stent and increased platelet aggregation, their adhesion and secretion contribute to the induction of migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Coronavirus infection is characterized by an acute systemic inflammatory response that can lead to a cytokine storm. A prothrombotic environment and platelet activation aggravate the situation and increase the risk of thrombosis. An increase in the level of tissue thromboplastin leads to an increase in the level of thrombin and fibrin synthesis with the possible development of disseminated intravascular coagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>. Therefore, coronavirus infection can be a trigger for the formation of restenosis in the area of a previously implanted coronary stent through a complex mechanism, which can cause complications in the long-term period after CVI.\n\n【27】In the article, we presented a description of ten cases of coronary arteries restenosis in patients who had a coronavirus infection in comparison with the matched patients who had restenosis without CVI. In each group, only one case was classified as subacute restenosis, the other cases represented late or very late restenosis.\n\n【28】The available literature sources mainly provide information on cases of acute thrombosis of coronary artery stents after coronavirus infection. Thus, in a study conducted in Spain, a sharp increase in the frequency of stent thrombosis during the peak of the pandemic in March–April 2020 was noted, with a decrease in the frequency of coronary interventions by 38% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. These data were later confirmed by the results of other similar studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 17\\]</u>. A feature of our study is the development of restenosis of previously implanted stents in patients at different times after CVI. Only in two cases, coronavirus infection was present at the time of development of restenosis, of which in one case the patient had severe COVID-associated pneumonia with a fatal outcome, in the second case the patient had a repeated episode of an asymptomatic infection confirmed by a high level of IgM. However, given the low percentage of restenosis of coronary artery stents worldwide, our results suggest a possible association between recent CVI and stent restenosis.\n\n【29】In patients included in our study, the incidence of comorbidities did not differ from the comparison group and other populations of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Endothelial dysfunction induced by arterial hypertension, diabetes, or obesity contributes to the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells and the formation of neointimal hyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【30】An increase in the level of fibrinogen in the blood plasma can serve as a predictor of restenosis after endovascular stenting. Fibrinogen, accumulating in the atherosclerotic ally affected intima, penetrates into the arterial wall, where it binds to lipoprotein-α, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which in turn triggers the synthesis of mediators involved in thrombosis. Growth factors, actively produced by platelets and monocytes, have a potentiating effect on hyperplasia and the proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells, thereby triggering the process of restenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In our study, in 60% of patients of the studied group, the fibrinogen level significantly exceeded normal values, and in the other patients, it was the upper limit of normal values, which could be associated not only with coronary heart disease but also with a previous coronavirus infection. In the patients included in our study, the level of lipoproteins practically did not go beyond the limits of normal values, which could be explained by the development of late and very late stent restenoses in them.\n\n【31】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【32】The results of our study suggest that patients with myocardial revascularization in the past have a higher risk of developing stent restenosis against the background of coronavirus infection due to excessive neointimal hyperplasia, hypercoagulability, increased inflammatory response, and endothelial dysfunction. Coronavirus infection can be a trigger for restenosis even in the long-term period after the disease, which is due to the long-term inflammatory process in the vascular wall and vascular remodeling associated with the activation of fibrosis processes.

Herein, we experienced a case of atopic myelitis developed during the growth of cervical cavernous angioma caused by bleeding. A 37-year-old woman suffered from hand swelling caused by a house cat licking. At the same time when cavernous angioma had grown, she experienced a numbness in her four extremities, and multifocal peritumoral hyperintense spinal cord signals were seen. The diagnosis of atopic myelitis was made because we observed significantly elevated levels of specific IgE antibody to cat dander. Symptoms disappeared immediately after steroid pulse therapy. We subsequently resected a cavernous angioma, and eosinophil invasion was found inside it. This is the first case report of atopic myelitis which developed in association with spinal cord vascular lesions. A local blood-brain barrier breakdown due to hemorrhagic lesions of the spinal cord may have contributed to the onset of atopic myelitis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Atopic myelitis is a type of myelitis which has received attention along with the recent dramatic increase in atopic disease. It develops in patients with elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) or allergic predisposition, such as atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, or bronchial asthma. Atopic myelitis occurs more commonly in the cervical spinal cord 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. There has been no report of atopic myelitis which occurs in association with vascular lesions of the brain and spinal cord. Herein, we report our experience with a case of atopic myelitis developed along with cervical cavernous angioma growth caused by bleeding.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】At the age of 35, the patient developed cervical cavernous angioma on the right side of spinal cord on ventral aspect at the level of the right sixth cervical (C6) vertebra due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A mild numbness of the four extremities remained after SAH. One year later, cavernous angioma had grown, and a numbness of the right upper extremity had been exacerbated. One year and a half after SAH, a numbness had extended from the trunk through both lower extremities, and a new T2-weighted intramedullary high-signal intensity area was found in spinal cord situated at the first to the second thoracic (T1-2) vertebral level . A numbness of the left upper extremity appeared 1 year and 9 months after SAH, and a new T2-weighted intramedullary high-signal intensity area was also observed in the left side of spinal cord on dorsal aspect at the third to the fourth cervical (C3-4) vertebral level .\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 MRI images of atopic myelitis.

A Previous History\n\n【8】The patient had no previous history of bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, and hay fever but experiences skin redness when a house cat licks her.\n\n【9】#### 4\\. Neuroradiology\n\n【10】Cavernous angioma was observed in the ventral side of the spinal cord at C6 vertebral level . Cavernous angioma was present in the ventral side of the right half the spinal cord  and partially extramedullary . Intramedullary high-signal intensity on T2 weighted image (T2WI) was observed in the spinal cord at T1-2 vertebral level  at the same time that a numbness of both lower extremities appeared. A high-signal intensity area spread forward to the anterior part of the posterior funiculus of the spinal cord, but the anterior funiculus and lateral funiculus were retained. A new intramedullary high-signal intensity area on T2WI appeared at C3-4 vertebral level when the patient experienced a numbness of the left upper extremity . A high-signal intensity area existed locally in the left posterior funiculus of the spinal cord .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 MRI images of cavernous angioma.

Blood Biochemical Findings\n\n【13】The followings were the laboratory results.\n\n【14】Complete blood count results were as follows: white blood cell count 4,400/μL (neutrophils: 65.6%, lymphocytes: 27.3%, monocytes: 4.8%, eosinophils: 1.8%, and basophils: 0.5%), hemoglobin 14.9 g/dL (range: 11.5–15.4), hematocrit 43.7% (range: 33.0–44.0), platelet count 19.8 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL (range: 13.0 × 10<sup>4</sup>–37.0 × 10<sup>4</sup>), total protein 6.8 g/dL (range: 6.7–8.3), albumin 4.4 g/dL (range: 3.8–5.3), AST 11 IU/L (range: 8–38), ALT 8 IU/L (range: 4–44), CPK 51 IU/L (range: 43–165), BUN 12.5 mg/dL (range: 8.0–20.0), creatine 0.71 mg/dL (range: 0.4–0.8), Na 139 mEq/L (range: 135–147), K 4.2 mEq/L (range: 3.3–108), glucose 92 mg/dL (range: 70–110), and C-reactive protein 0.02 mg/dL (range: 0.0–0.3). A nonspecific IgE level was 497 IU/mL (normal range: 0–170), and a specific IgE level to cat dander was 85.5 UA/mL (reference range: 0–0.34). The patient exhibited patch test positivity to any of the following 12 substances: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, cat, dog, Cynodon dactylon, Dactylis glomerata, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Artemisia indica var. maximowiczii, Betula platyphylla, Cryptomeria japonica, Candida, and Alternaria. Antibody against aquaporin-4 was negative. In the meantime, all following test results stayed within a normal range: serum complement level, complement components 3 and 4, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-DNA antibody, anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody, anti-Smith antibody, anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, anticardiolipin and anti–β2-glycoprotein I complex, and lupus anticoagulant.\n\n【15】#### 6\\. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis\n\n【16】Results of CSF analysis were as follows: specific gravity 1.006 (range: 1.005–1.007), protein 29 mg/dL (reference range: 8–43), glucose 68 mg/dL (reference range: 50–75), and total number of cells present 3/μL (3 mononuclear cells, 0 polynuclear cells).\n\n【17】No oligoclonal IgG bands were detected.\n\n【18】#### 7\\. Brain MRI\n\n【19】There were no abnormal findings including high-intensity signals in T2 weighted image.\n\n【20】#### 8\\. Medical Therapy and Posttherapy Course\n\n【21】As a reason for multifocal hyperintense spinal cord signal, we considered the possibility of neuroinflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, or connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis, Behcet’s disease, and so on 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>, other than atopic myelitis, but we were skeptical about these possibilities according to the results of blood biochemical study. The diagnosis of atopic myelitis was made based on the blood biochemical findings, and steroid pulse therapy was performed using methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day, for 3 days). A numbness which has extended from the trunk through the left upper and lower extremities, along with the right lower extremity, disappeared immediately following the therapy. After hospital discharge, efforts were made to segregate a house cat and normalize skin barrier by increasing moisture retention.\n\n【22】#### 9\\. Surgical Management and Postoperative Course\n\n【23】Atopic myelitis did not recur, but cavernous angioma was totally resected because its growth was identified . Imaging findings presented cavernous angioma inside and outside the spinal cord. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital with maintaining independence in the activities of daily living.\n\n【24】#### 10\\. Histopathological Study\n\n【25】Pathological examination of the resected cavernous angioma was performed. Hematoma was present inside the cavernous angioma, and irregularly enlarged vascular structure with thin vascular wall was observed  as the typical pathological findings of cavernous angioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Eosinophil invasion was seen in the high cell density area .\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Pathological tissue images of the resected cavernous angioma (hematoxylin and eosin stain).

(b) Cytoplasm in red, along with invasion by eosinophils which have an unevenly distributed nucleus, is observed (black arrowhead) (bar = 10 μm).</u>\n\n【27】#### 11\\. Discussion\n\n【28】Atopic myelitis, an allergic disease with high serum levels of IgE and antigen-specific IgE, is the concept of disease advocated by Kira et al. in 1997 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A nationwide survey on atopic myelitis has been conducted by Isobe et al. in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Atopic myelitis is apt to develop after exacerbation of underlying allergic diseases which include atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, and allergic conjunctivitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10\\]</u>. In some way, it seems that atopic myelitis results from the transmission of allergic reaction from the bloodstream to the spinal cord, but the detailed mechanism of atopic myelitis is still unknown.\n\n【30】Symptoms include paresthesia that is not associated with mobility impairment, and most patients initially present with a mild numbness. According to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, high-intensity signal on T2WI is present around the posterior funiculus of the cervical spinal cord 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, gadolinium enhancement and edematous changes in the spinal cord are found in the acute stage, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is locally observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Atopic myelitis is pathologically considered as vasculitis in the presence of invasion by eosinophils which seem to act as effector cells in myelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. Steroid pulse therapy is used to treat atopic myelitis, but the efficacy rate is about 70%. Plasma exchange is used if steroid pulse therapy is ineffective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Cavernous angioma is a type of vascular malformation which grows while repeating extremely light bleeding. Pathologically speaking, vascular structure with irregularly enlarged, thin-walled vessels was observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Cavernous angioma is sometimes identified as the cause of SAH, and extremely light bleeding can be confirmed by T2-star-weighted MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Because cavernous angioma grows while bleeding, the resection of cavernous angioma is considered when neurological deficits are observed after the growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【32】In this case, the patient did not present with previous major atopic disease or exacerbation of atopic disease, such as atopic dermatitis or bronchial asthma, but because of high serum levels of IgE along with a detailed history of the patient, we diagnosed cat allergy, of which the patient herself was not aware. With regard to a miner allergy, attention is required because a detailed history needs to be taken from the patient. In addition, because cavernous angioma had caused SAH and afterward had grown while repeating mild bleeding, BBB breakdown might have occurred in the cervical spinal cord. During the growth of cavernous angioma, the patient developed atopic myelitis in multiple areas adjacent to the angioma, and eosinophil invasion was observed inside the resected cavernous angioma; therefore, BBB breakdown resulting from vascular lesions associated with bleeding may have facilitated the transmission of allergic reaction from the bloodstream to the spinal cord.\n\n【33】#### 12\\. Conclusion\n\n【34】This article is the first case report of atopic myelitis which developed in association with vascular lesions of the central nervous system. BBB breakdown due to angioma may have been involved in the transmission of allergic reaction to the spinal cord.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:04:49", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:05:05", "cost": 15.421}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:36", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:05:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:04:49"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Hyperphosphatemia may arise from various conditions including exogenous ingestion, extracellular shifts due to cell death or alterations in acid-base status, increased bone resorption, hormonal abnormalities leading to reduced renal excretion, and/or reduced kidney function.

Additionally, hyperphosphatemia may result from minor problems associated with the phosphate-measuring technique or presence of phosphate-containing products in blood samples, referred to as pseudohyperphosphatemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. Although pseudohyperphosphatemia is well-described in the literature, it may be under-recognized in routine practice because, unless severe, mild to moderate hyperphosphatemia lacks immediate life-threatening consequences and, accordingly, likely receives a high threshold for clinical concerns and proper evaluation.\n\n【4】We herein present a case of a young pregnant female who presented with mild acute kidney injury (AKI), invasive mucormycosis receiving liposomal amphotericin, and hyperphosphatemia out of proportion to the degree of kidney injury. While the patient was initiated on a phosphate-binding agent by her primary care team for presumed AKI-associated hyperphosphatemia, a full investigation by the renal consulting team for contributing factors other than kidney injury was performed. A thorough evaluation revealed that the patient actually had pseudohyperphosphatemia associated with the use of liposomal amphotericin and promptly averted erroneous phosphate-lowering therapy. A review of the literature for conditions associated with pseudohyperphosphatemia will be discussed.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Clinical History\n\n【7】A 35-year-old 7-week-pregnant woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus was admitted for a fungating mass involving the clivus and cervical vertebrae, presumed to be invasive mucormycosis. On hospital day 1, the patient was initiated on liposomal amphotericin (10 mg/kg) with normal saline support. On day 4, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and ampicillin/sulbactam were added for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcal aureus and Prevotella buccae cultured from the fungating mass. On day 10, the patient was noted to have acute kidney injury (AKI) when her creatinine increased from 0.4-0.5 mg/dL to 1.46 mg/dL in association with a progressive increase in serum phosphorus up to 10.7 mg/dL. Nephrology consulting service was consulted for AKI and concurrent multiple electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Laboratory findings are presented in Table 1. Urinalysis was benign with no proteinuria or blood; 3 white blood cells, less than 1 red blood cell, and 2 squamous cells were noted per high power field. Patient’s primary team promptly replaced her potassium and magnesium and started sevelamer carbonate 2400 mg t.i.d with meals for hyperphosphatemia. Other medications included aspirin 81 mg q.d, atorvastatin 80 mg q.d, insulin glargine 40 units q.d, metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours, midodrine 10 mg q.d, and pantoprazole 40 mg q.d.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Patient’s laboratory findings.</u>\n\n【9】Physical exam: temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 66 beats per minute, respiratory rate 17 beats per minute, and blood pressure 98/55 mmHg. Head, neck, heart, lungs, and abdomen exams were all within normal limits. Extremities had no edema or rash. Neurological exam revealed no focal abnormalities.\n\n【10】##### 2.2. Additional Investigations\n\n【11】Chart review was notable for a prolonged hypotensive episode on day 6 when patient’s blood pressure dropped from a baseline of 100/80 mmHg to 75–85/50–60 mmHg over a duration of 4 hours. Additionally, the patient received a computed tomogram with intravenous contrast on the same day.\n\n【12】The underlying etiology of AKI was relatively straight forward and thought to be multifactorial that could be related to the hypotensive episode, tubulointerstitial injury and/or decreased tubular secretion of creatinine unrelated to kidney injury associated with trimethoprim, contrast-induced kidney injury, amphotericin-induced reduced renal blood flow with or without direct tubular toxicity, and possibly early acute tubulointerstitial disease associated with the use of different antibiotics or pantoprazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Electrolyte abnormalities including acute onset of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia were attributed to amphotericin-induced tubular cell membrane injury with resulting electrolyte wasting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The mild metabolic acidosis was attributed to the ongoing AKI and possibly some degree of proton back-flow induced by amphotericin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Mild chronic respiratory alkalosis was attributed to the pregnancy state.\n\n【14】Hyperphosphatemia, however, was thought to be significantly elevated and out of proportion to the degree of kidney injury. A systematic investigation for hyperphosphatemia was performed and is summarized in Table 2. Based on patient’s clinical history and laboratory findings, both her pregnancy state and chronic respiratory alkalosis could have contributed to hyperphosphatemia, but only to a mild degree 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. In a nonpregnant adult female, serum phosphorus generally ranges from 2.5 to 4.3 mg/dL but may increase slightly to 3.1 to 4.6 mg/dL during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. With chronic respiratory alkalosis, renal resistance to parathyroid has been reported to occur which could lead to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. Nonetheless, the rise in serum phosphorus would only be expected to be within 20% from baseline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Furthermore, patient’s serum calcium level was within normal limits after correction for hypoalbuminemia which likely excludes hypoparathyroidism as a contributing factor.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Evaluation of hyperphosphatemia.</u>\n\n【16】Discussion with our institutional laboratory staff for the possibility of pseudohyperphosphatemia revealed that our institution uses the Beckman-Coulter DxC 800 instrument to measure phosphorus. Unbeknown to all involved clinicians, this instrument is known to measure falsely elevated phosphorus levels in patients receiving liposomal amphotericin B.\n\n【17】While the Beckman-Coulter analyzer revealed a phosphorus level of 10.7 mg/dl for our patient, measurement of phosphorus from the same blood sample on the Roche Cobas instrument from a nearby medical center resulted in a phosphorus level of 4.8 mg/dL.\n\n【18】Diagnosis: pseudohyperphosphatemia due to intravenous administration of high dose liposomal amphotericin.\n\n【19】##### 2.3. Clinical Follow-Up\n\n【20】Phosphate-lowering therapy with sevelamer was promptly discontinued. Patient’s AKI slowly improved with fluid support and avoidance of further administration of nephrotoxins. Of interest, within 24 hours of amphotericin switch to micafungin from the infectious disease perspective, patient’s phosphorus level returned to 4.0 mg/dL as measured by our own Beckman-Coulter analyzer. The patient was discharged within two weeks with resolution of AKI and normal electrolytes.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】Measurement of inorganic phosphate relies on the binding of phosphate anions to the acidified ammonium molybdate to form a yellow molybdenum-phosphate complex that absorbs light at 340 nm. Phosphate concentration is subsequently determined based on the absorbance of molybdenum-phosphate complex with ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Chemical analyzers that use very low pH reagent to acidify ammonium molybdate may also hydrolyze organic phosphate from compounds that are present in the serum, which is then measured as part of serum phosphate concentration. Theoretically, administration of any drug that is formulated with phosphorylated liposomal bilayer may also similarly cause pseudohyperphosphatemia. The extent of pseudohyperphosphatemia, however, would depend on the concentration of the culprit drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Clinicians are advised to consult with their own institutional laboratory staff for the accuracy in the measurement of phosphate by their instrument when phosphate levels are measured among patients receiving drugs formulated with phospholipids.\n\n【23】Of interest, pseudohyperphosphatemia has also been reported in situations involving paraproteinemia (multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance), heparin or alteplase-containing blood samples, hemolysis, and hyperlipidemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. The precipitation of paraproteins and associated turbidity caused by the acidic reagent used in the phosphate measurement assay has been suggested to interfere with light absorbance by ultraviolet spectrophotometry and erroneous measurement of phosphate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Similarly, turbidity has also been suggested to be the cause of pseudohyperphosphatemia reported with hyperlipidemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. Turbidity alone as the cause of pseudohyperphosphatemia associated with paraproteinemia, however, has been challenged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Excess binding of phosphate to certain paraproteins or the actual physicochemical property of the paraprotein or both have also been implicated as a cause of pseudohyperphosphatemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–14\\]</u>. As for heparin and alteplase-contaminated blood samples, phosphate is therein present as a pH buffer agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15–17\\]</u>. In the case of hemolysis or any other forms of cell death including tissue infarction and rhabdomyolysis, hyperphosphatemia may be expected as phosphate is a predominant intracellular anion which is released with cell lysis. In essence, hyperphosphatemia in these conditions is “true” hyperphosphatemia. Although hyperbilirubinemia and prolonged blood storage at cold temperature have also been reported to be associated with pseudohyperphosphatemia, these associations have not been confirmed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 18, 19\\]</u>.

It may affect any organ and tissue in the body, in particular the liver and Lung. Musculoskeletal or soft tissue hydatidosis accounts for about 0,5%–5% of all echinococcal infections in endemic areas and is almost secondary to the hepatic or pulmonary disease (Karaman et al. 2011; Dirican et al. 2008; Kouskos et al. 2007). Case Presentation. We report an unusual case of primary subcutaneous hydatidosis in the left supraclavicular region of the neck. A 53-year-old female patient was admitted with three-month history of pain and gradually growing mass located in the left supraclavicular region. Physical examination revealed a moderately hard, painful, and erythematous mass. The blood cell count was normal. Computed tomography demonstrated, a multilocular cystic lesion with thin borders and thin wall. The mass is binocular and extends to the scapula. CT showed no involvement of the lung. From these signs, the patient was diagnosed as having abscess (bacterial infection or tuberculosis). The diagnosis of Echinococcus granulosus infection was made per operatively after visualization of the cyst wall and the daughter cysts. Following irrigation of cystic cavity with hypertonic saline solution, the cyst wall was excised along with a portion of surrounding tissue. Histopathological examination of the specimen confirmed the hydatid origin. Hemagglutination tests for Echinococcus and ELISA were negative. Ultrasound of the abdomen was normal. The patient received albendazole (400 mg/day) for 8 weeks postoperatively. No sign of recurrence could be detected by physical examination and imaging (CT) at 4-month followup. Conclusion. The case illustrates that echinococcal disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of every cystic mass in every anatomic location, especially when it occurs in endemic areas.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hydatid disease is an important infestation caused by the parasite Echinococcus granulosus and still common in countries in the temperate zones, including the Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Southeast Asia and China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Hydatids are mostly found in the liver and/or in lungs for physiopathological reasons, but several other encysting sites are possible; bone is included. The musculoskeletal involvement has been registered in only 1–4% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. It has been hypothesized that the presence of lactic acid in the muscle does not allow the larvae to grow into cysts. Only few cases of primary subcutaneous hydatidosis have been reported, and even in regions with endemic Echinococcosis, hydatidosis of cervicofacial region is extremely rare.\n\n【4】We would like to point out that, regardless of the site involved, this zoonotic infection should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of any cystic lesion especially in endemic areas.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 53-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a three-month history of painful mass growing on the left lateral side of the neck. She reported neither fever nor a weight loss. Upon physical examination, some hard, painful, and fluctuant mass of 10 × 7 cm was palpable on the supraclavicular region of the lateral neck. The overlying skin was inflammatory. We did not find any regional lymphadenopathy. The blood cell count was normal except an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR 40 mm/h). No abnormality was found in chest X-ray.\n\n【7】CT scan demonstrated a binocular mass on the left supraclavicular region with cystic aspect. Its dimensions are 1 4 × 1 0  cm, and it contains numerous cystic formations with thin outlines . From this clinical and radiographic signs, the patient was diagnosed as having pyogenic abscess or tuberculosis, and its excision or drainage was planned. The diagnosis of Echinococcus granulosus infection was confirmed perioperatively after visualization of the cyst wall and daughter cysts . Following irrigation of cystic cavity with hypertonic saline solution, the cyst wall was excised with a portion of overlying skin and muscle . Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed hydatid cyst and showed an inflammatory tissue reaction surrounding “parasite-like cyst.” Scoleces were also detected within the surgical specimen. The patient was subjected to ultrasound of the abdomen and urologic examination. Hemagglutination tests for Echinococcus and ELISA were negative. The investigation did not reveal any extracervical sites for other hydatid cyst. The patient received Albendazole (400 mg/day) for eight weeks postoperatively. No sign of recurrence could be detected by physical examination and imaging at the 4-month followup.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | CT scan demonstrated cystic structure in the left supraclavicular region with multivesicular lesions. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Subcutaneous hydatid cyst in the left supraclavicular region of the neck. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | A view of the resected cyst and its germinative membrane with daughter cysts. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Operative field after cyst resection.

Discussion\n\n【13】Hydatid cyst disease is still a major health problem in agricultural countries including Tunisia. The parasite is named Echinococcus granulosus, and humans can be an incidental intermediary host in the life cycle of the parasite. Although cysts are most commonly located in the liver (50–65%) and the lungs (20–30%), multiorgan involvement is seen in 20–30% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. The musculoskeletal involvement has been registered in only 1–5%. It has been hypothesized that the presence of lactic acid in the muscle does not allow the larvae to grow into cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. Soft tissue hydatid cysts occur in 2-3% of cases reported from endemic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Diagnosis of Echinococcus should be considered when slowing growing soft tissue is present in patient from a rural area especially endemic country. The clinical manifestation of the disease is a result of the localization and pressure effect of the slow-growing cyst on the infected organ. The main complaints of patients have been pain and sense of malaise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–6\\]</u>. As in our case, clinical findings and physical examination did not reveal the correct diagnosis. Our initial diagnosis was soft tissue suppuration or tuberculosis. Echinococcus granulosus infection may also mimic malignancy because of sudden enlargement of the cyst and the formation of structural deformities in the tissue over time.\n\n【15】Ecchinococcosis is diagnosed essentially by the patient’s history, physical examination findings, radiologic imaging modalities, and serological tests. Although imaging methods usually exhibit nonspecific findings, they may be helpful for making the diagnosis. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging can show the association of the cyst with neighboring tissues, the internal laminar wall of the cyst, and intraluminal daughter cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5–7\\]</u>. CT and US show the hydatid sands in purely cystic lesion as well as floating membranes, daughter cysts, and vesicles most clearly are the methods of choice for searching for the pathognomonic criteria of hydatid cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. For Mekki et al. MRI appears to be the most useful imaging technique when a complex or solid pattern is present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient has a CT of the neck and chest when he was admitted into our clinic, so we did not need any other radiologic imaging. Although imaging techniques are reported to enlighten the diagnosis of hydatid cyst, the diagnosis was missed in the CT scan of the neck and chest in our case, and the mass was reported as a simple cystic structure. Abdominal and chest X-rays, ultrasound, and CT scans should be performed in order to investigate various organ involvements, particularly liver and lungs. Eroglu et al. and Iynen et al. have reported an unusual case of hydatid cyst found in the neck, and just like our paper, there was no pulmonary or hepatic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【16】To confirm the diagnosis, serologic tests, including direct hemagglutination, latex agglutination, immunoelectrophoresis, skin tests, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are widely used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 5, 7\\]</u>. The sensitivity of various serological tests used for hydatid disease varies from 64 to 87% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, all serologic tests have low diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Hydatid serology is only valuable when it is positive, and negative serologic test does not exclude the diagnosis. We performed hemagglutination test and ELISA test in our patient, and the result was negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3, 7–11\\]</u>. So, the diagnosis of E. granulosis in our patient was made on the basis of the exposure in an endemic area like Tunisia, the CT imagings, the operative findings, and on histopathological examinations. Serological tests were negative, and specific tests like Western Blot assay for specific E. granulosis proteins and enzyme immunoassay for specific IgG were not made.\n\n【17】The best treatment option is total surgical excision without opening the cyst. If the cyst cannot be excised without opening, the fluid contents should be removed, the laminated membrane should be totally excised, and the cyst pouch should be irrigated with protoscolicidal solutions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 7, 8, 11\\]</u>. This approach was made in our patient, and the cyst cavity was excised partially because of the deep location of the cyst and its vascular relationships. Subcutaneous located cysts are more prone to rupture since they have not been diagnosed preoperatively. Medical treatment with antihelmintic drugs, such as mebendazole and albendazole, should be included especially for disseminated, inaccessible hydatidosis and for patients who do not favor the morbidity of an operative process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 9, 11–15\\]</u>. These drugs may also play an important role in conjunction with surgery, both preoperatively for sterilization of the cyst and postoperatively in case of spillage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 13, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【18】#### 4\\.

The aim of the present study was to report the physiological stimulation of the synthesis of preelastic fibers in the dermis of a patient with fibrosis. Design. A clinical study was conducted involving the analysis of histological changes in preelastic fibers following treatment for stage II primary lymphedema for the clinical reversal of lymphedema and fibrosis. Setting. University Hospital of the São Jose do Rio Preto of School of Medicine in 2020. Participant was a 67-year-old male patient with late-onset primary lymphedema diagnosed 12 years earlier. Intervention is the lymphatic stimulation using the Godoy method adapted to the treatment of fibrosis. Main outcomes and measures are biopsies before and after treatment. Ten randomly selected histological fields were evaluated using the multipoint morphometric method. The values with this method are relative and expressed as percentages. Statistical analysis was performed with the t\\-test, considering a 95% significance level. Results. A visible, significant difference in the percentage of preelastic fibers was found between the preintervention and postintervention slides, which were confirmed by the microscopic evaluation and quantification (4.95 ± 0.64% and 14.70 ± 1.06%, respectively). Conclusion. The physiological stimulation of the lymphatic system using a specific method resulted in the clinical reduction of fibrosis, the return of the elasticity of the skin, and the stimulation of the synthesis of preelastic fibers.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Fibrosis results from conditions that lead to the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), compromising tissue function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The main characteristic of fibrosis is the excessive secretion of connective tissue fibers, which is associated with a myriad of diseases that lead to organ failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The critical event in the development of fibrosis is the aberrant, sustained activation of fibroblasts in myofibroblasts, which produce high levels of ECM, leading to the formation of a dense fibrous tissue in the affected area and increasing local rigidity of the tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Diseases with fibrosis place a substantial burden on the healthcare system and economy and are often fatal. Although fibrosis is traditionally considered an irreversible process, there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that the fibrosis of organs can be reversed under certain circumstances, especially if the underlying cause is removed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Elastic fibers are essential components of all elastic tissues in mammals, such as blood vessels, lungs, and skin, and are extremely important due to the mechanical properties these fibers confer to tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The network of dermal fibers is the main effector of elasticity in the skin, enabling it to stretch and return to its original position many times throughout life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Fibrillin-rich microfibrils (FRMs) are integral components of the elastic fiber network, with differential deposition in the papillary dermis in individuals of different skin colors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【6】It is important to note that the resolution of fibrosis requires the degradation of other ECM components, such as proteoglycans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, elastic fibers, and collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Novel concepts in the treatment of lymphedema have been adapted to the treatment of fibrosis. Such concepts propose the normalization or near normalization of lymphedema in all clinical stages, including elephantiasis, with the clinical reversal of fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–15\\]</u>. The aim of the present study was to report the physiological stimulation of the synthesis of preelastic fibers in the dermis of a patient with fibrosis.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【8】A 67-year-old male patient with late-onset primary lymphedema diagnosed 12 years earlier and one episode of erysipelas in this period was submitted to physical examination, which revealed fibrosis of the dermis characterized by the absence of Godet’s sign. The patient was otherwise healthy, not obese, had no comorbidities, and continued working normally. The Godoy method for the treatment of lymphedema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–15\\]</u> adapted to fibrosis was proposed to achieve the normalization of the dermis (return of elasticity). The intensive treatment method consists of cervical lymphatic therapy using the Godoy method (approximately 30 gentle movements on the skin in the supraclavicular region 15–20 minutes per day) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, combined with 8 hours of mechanical lymphatic therapy involving an electromechanical device that performs approximately 25 passive plantar flexion and extension movements per minute 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, 2 hours per day of manual lymphatic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, and a compression mechanism (hand-crafted stocking made with grosgrain fabric 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> alternated with medium-stretch elastic bandages maintained throughout the entire treatment). These therapies were performed simultaneously totaling about 8 hours/day. The duration of treatment was 2 months, when the clinical reversal of fibrosis was achieved, and the elasticity of the skin had improved. The clinical evaluation of the skin was constant throughout the treatment, and at the time, it had its elasticity clinically evaluated by manual skin pinching. At that time, there was no difference in this elasticity in relation to the normal contralateral limb. At this point, the postintervention biopsy was performed. Biopsies were performed before and after the intervention in the same region at a distance of 1 cm of other in parallel. For such, basic surgical care was taken, such as asepsis and antisepsis, local anesthesia using 2 ml de xylocaine 2%, followed by a longitudinal wedge-shaped incision approximately 1 cm in length and 0.5 cm in width. The biopsied material was maintained in 10% formol and embedded in paraffin. The slides were stained with orcein and resorcin-fuchsin evaluated under an optical microscope. The magnifications were 10X and 40X. Ten randomly selected histological fields were evaluated using the multipoint morphometric method proposed by Weibel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The values with this method are relative and expressed as percentages. The data were submitted to a normality test and expressed as mean and standard deviation values. Comparisons were performed using the t\\-test with the level of significance set at 95%, using Stats direct 3.\n\n【9】A visible, significant difference in the percentage of preelastic fibers was found between the preintervention and postintervention slides, which was confirmed by the microscopic evaluation and quantification (4.95 ± 0.64% and 14.70 ± 1.06%, value < 0.05, respectively) .\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Morphometry of epidermis and dermal papillae and area of connective fibers before and after treatment.</u>\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Preelastic fibers.

In this case, use the grosgrain stocking.\n\n【13】This study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of the São Jose do Rio Preto School of Medicine (certificate number: 4.398.518). The patient signed a statement of informed consent.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】This is the first study in the international literature to show the possibility of the physiological stimulation of the synthesis of preelastic fibers and remodeling of these fibers during the clinical treatment of primary lymphedema with fibrosis. In a previous evaluation (in publication phase), an important rearrangement of elastin was found, with an approximately 250% increase in the number of fibers. In the present investigation, a more specific evaluation was performed of preelastic fibers in the dermis, in which a significant increase of 336% was found after treatment, with an increase in the number of fibers in the superficial dermis as well as an increase in the number and thickness of fibers in the deep dermis.\n\n【16】The treatment method influenced the physiological remodeling of this protein, which could be attributed to the synthesis of new elastic fibers. These fibers account for only 2–4% of the ECM but play an important role in the elasticity of the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The present study paves the way for a new line of research involving the physiological stimulation of the production and remodeling of elastin.\n\n【17】The treatment method employed is a novel concept for the treatment of lymphedema adapted to fibrosis, which has specific characteristics. The method is proposed to achieve the clinical reversal of lymphedema, including elephantiasis, to standards of normality or near normality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The main hypothesis for the development of fibrosis in lymphedema is the lack of the mobilization of macromolecules by the lymphatic system combined with other mechanisms, such as inflammation, interference in the production of the elements of the ECM, and the failure of fibrinolysis. All these mechanisms are currently being evaluated specifically to gain a better understanding of these cellular and ECM dynamics.\n\n【19】Elastin and collagen are the main constituents of the fibers of the ECM and are therefore of fundamental importance in the development of fibrosis. Further studies are needed to identify each of the structures and mechanisms that may be involved in the dynamics of the formation of fibrosis, which has different stages and each stage may have distinct characteristics.

He presented with fever, dizziness, dyspnea on exertion, intermittent chest pain, and palpitations. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed two medium-sized densities along the inner aspect of the sewing ring and one larger density along the atrial surface of the sewing ring consistent with vegetation.

We present the case of a 48-year-old male with late PVE caused by Corynebacterium propinquum. To our knowledge, this case represents the first in the literature of Corynebacterium propinquum causing prosthetic valve endocarditis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 48-year-old male presented with five to six weeks of dizziness with episodes of subjective fever. Patient also reported having increasing dyspnea on exertion associated with intermittent sharp chest pain, unrelated to exertion, and palpitations lasting 20–30 seconds per episode. Additionally, he complained of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but denied orthopnea, peripheral edema, recent dental work, surgical procedure, or intravenous drug use. He has a significant past medical history of hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis on chronic low dose prednisone therapy, and rheumatic heart disease not on antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient had a mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve 27 years priorly, which was subsequently replaced with a metallic valve 12 years ago. The patient had a pacemaker placed for symptomatic bradycardia 12 years ago.\n\n【6】On admission, the patient was an ill appearing male and was complaining of a dull aching chest pain 4/10 in intensity. Vital signs were significant for fever of 101.6°F (38.6°C). Physical examination revealed tactile fever, clear breath sounds, and metallic S1. Laboratory findings showed a hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, leukocytosis of 17,900/uL with 91% PMNs, INR of 6.1, Troponin-I of 0.534 ng/mL, ESR of 85, and C-reactive protein of 20.70 mg/dL. Patient also had an elevated creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL. Prosthetic valve endocarditis was suspected and the patient received broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin. Vancomycin was changed to daptomycin due to worsening renal function. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 50%. It also showed a mechanical prosthesis in the mitral position with two medium-sized, strand-like, echogenic, highly mobile densities along the inner aspect of the sewing ring and one larger echogenic, spherical density, measuring 9 × 5 mm along the atrial surface of the sewing ring, consistent with vegetation as shown in Figure 1. Two separate blood cultures drawn four hours apart from different sites on the initial day of presentation grew Corynebacterium propinquum.

Discussion\n\n【12】The genus Corynebacterium has more than 80 published species of which over 50 can cause occasional or rare infections in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Corynebacterium species are normal colonizers of the skin and mucous membranes and are often dismissed as culture contaminants. It is thought that the incidence of nondiphtheria Corynebacterium is increasing, especially as a cause of nosocomial infections and infections in immunocompromised patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In our case, the patient was on prednisone, which could have contributed to development of infection with Corynebacterium. In recent literature, there have been an increasing number of reports of Corynebacterium species causing prosthetic valve endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Corynebacterium propinquum is primarily isolated from the human respiratory tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It has been shown to be the pathogenic organism in two cases of native valve infective endocarditis, one in an adult and one in a child with congenital heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. It has also been reported as the causative agent in a handful of respiratory tract infections worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. It has also been reported to cause acute nongonococcal urethritis in one patient from Iran 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Corynebacterium propinquum causing prosthetic valve endocarditis. The susceptibility pattern for the strain of C. propinquum from our case showed high resistance to vancomycin and daptomycin, which is unusual for this species. As in other studies, it was susceptible to beta-lactams and an aminoglycoside as well as other antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Due to the rarity of infections caused by this bacteria, it would be premature to make assumptions regarding resistance patterns.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】Corynebacterium species are becoming recognized as an increasing cause of opportunistic infections.

In this case report, we present a 65-year-old female with unilateral lower extremity edema secondary to occlusion of iliac vessels by a primary retroperitoneal melanoma tumor. We also review the findings in other cases previously described in the literature.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primary retroperitoneal melanoma (PRM) is an extremely rare form of malignant extracutaneous melanoma with a poor prognosis. Although malignant melanomas arise from the skin in vast majority of cases, they can also appear in other organs where melanocytes are present including the eye, meninges and mucosa, and much less commonly in the retroperitoneal space. Diagnosis of a retroperitoneal melanoma requires a thorough cutaneous, mucosal, and ocular exam to ensure there are no primary lesions in these areas that may have metastasized to the retroperitoneal space. In this case report, we present a rare case of primary retroperitoneal melanoma with involvement of the left iliac artery and vein.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 65-year-old Caucasian female presented with a two-week history of left lower extremity swelling and pain. The patient stated that the swelling slightly improved with elevation of her legs and that the pain was partially alleviated with NSAIDs. The patient denied any shortness of breath, recent trauma, fever, chest pain, or unexplained weight loss. She had a past medical history significant for inflammatory polyarthritis (on methotrexate and Humira), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, osteopenia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She had been taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation with international normalized ratio (INR) levels within the therapeutic range. The patient had a history of three-pack years of smoking but stated she quit approximately 40 years ago.\n\n【6】On physical examination, the presence of pitting edema of her left lower extremity was noted . There were strong peripheral pulses, and her abdomen was soft and nondistended. Blood work was significant for severe hypokalemia (2.8 mEq/L), which was repleted in clinic. Both erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels were checked and found to be elevated at 35.0 mm/hr and 30.1 mg/L, respectively. An ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity was negative for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A computed tomography (CT) angiography of the abdomen/pelvis was then performed and revealed a large heterogeneous left pelvic retroperitoneal mass centered at the left iliac chain region spanning 8.7 × 6.9 × 8.5 cm with probable compression/occlusion of the adjacent iliac vein . Based on the imaging study, the differential diagnosis included sarcoma, lymphoma, ovarian neoplasm, or germ cell tumor.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Patient’s initial presentation of left lower extremity edema.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Computed tomography of the abdomen reveals 8.7 × 6.9 × 8.5 cm mass (red arrow) in the retroperitoneal space.</u>\n\n【9】A CT-guided abdominal mass needle core biopsy was performed, and the sample was sent for H&E staining  as well as immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Immunostaining showed that the tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive for SOX10  but were negative for CK7, CK20, GATA3, and PAX8. These immunohistochemical stain findings support a diagnosis of melanoma. The tumor cells were also positive for S100 immunostaining  and BRAF V600E mutation, thereby further confirming the diagnosis. Upon review of the case and the CT scan, surgical oncology determined that the mass was surgically unresectable due to invasion of the adjacent iliac vessels. A comprehensive workup was performed to search for primary and secondary involvement of other sites, including an MRI brain and brainstem with no contrast and a full body PET scan, both of which were unremarkable.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 (a) Nest of tumor cells showing areas of necrosis (H&E, original magnification ×100).

Therefore, a diagnosis of primary retroperitoneal melanoma was rendered. The patient was also referred to an oncologist who offered the patient clinical trial for EA6134 (a randomized phase III trial of dabrafenib and trametinib followed by ipilimumab and nivolumab) since the tumor contained the mutation BRAF V600. Five months after being started on the clinical trial, the patient was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and encephalopathy. She was evaluated by an oncologist who determined that her encephalopathy was the result of her chemotherapy, and her participation in the trial was therefore withdrawn. The patient was discharged to a hospice facility and succumbed to the disease one month later, six months after her initial diagnosis.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Melanoma, a malignancy arising from melanocytes, is the deadliest form of cutaneous malignancy. Most malignant melanomas arise from the skin, and only 5% of all primary melanomas arise from extracutaneous tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Extracutaneous malignant melanomas are extremely rare and aggressive lesions, and therefore the rarity and aggressive nature of this disease make its diagnosis and treatment a challenging task. To date, only 7 cases of PRM have been reported in the English-language literature  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–8\\]</u>. The initial symptoms of primary retroperitoneal melanoma can be nonspecific and include fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, and leg swelling; however, of these 7 previously reported cases and our own 8<sup>th</sup> case, some specific presenting signs can be identified. In 4 of the 8 cases (50%), patients presented with abdominal pain, in three cases (38%) with abdominal distension/fullness, and in one case with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5, 8\\]</u>. CT plays an important role in the diagnosis of primary retroperitoneal melanoma as it can localize the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However, immunohistochemical stains are required for the definitive diagnosis of PRM. Both cutaneous and noncutaneous melanomas exhibit the same immunohistochemical and structural features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite the variety of immunohistochemical markers for melanoma, S100 remains the most sensitive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In addition, SOX10 is a transcription factor that has also been shown to be a sensitive marker of melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Both S100 and SOX10 immunostains were positive in our case. The patient’s melanoma also contained a mutation in the BRAF gene, which is present in approximately 50% of cases of advanced melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Negative immunostaining for CK7, CK20, GATA3, and PAX8 also played a vital role in ruling out other probable malignancies and arriving at the diagnosis of melanoma. For instance, PAX8 is a specific and sensitive marker for renal and ovarian carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and protein GATA3 has been previously reported to be expressed in epithelial proliferations of the female genital tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Literature review of other reported cases of PRM.</u>\n\n【15】Clear guidelines for the treatment of primary retroperitoneal malignant melanoma have not yet been defined due to the rarity of this disease, and therefore, therapy is based on evidence derived from the treatment of cutaneous melanoma. The mainstay of therapy for melanoma remains surgical resection, but if the tumor is surgically unresectable or in the case of more advanced disease, then systemic therapy is recommended. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib are small molecule inhibitors of BRAF kinase and are first-line treatment for BRAF mutation-positive melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib are similar in efficacy, but dabrafenib is associated with less toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Another treatment regimen option includes programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, which are emerging as successful therapy for metastatic melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In conclusion, we report a case of primary retroperitoneal melanoma with involvement of the iliac artery and vein causing lower extremity edema.

Discussion\n\n【17】CD is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–6\\]</u>. It is variously named as angiofollicular hyperplasia, giant lymph node hyperplasia, angiomatous lymphoid hyperplasia, localized nodal hyperplasia, and lymphoid hamartoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>. CD has a wide age distribution ranging from adolescence to seven decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【18】In 1972 Keller et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> divided CD in three histologic types: hyaline vascular type (75–90%), plasma cell type (10–25%), and mixed type (1–4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. The hyaline-vascular type is characterized by small-to medium-sized follicles that contain small blood vessels that penetrate atrophic germinal centers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. The mantle zone lymphocytes arrange in concentric layering at the periphery of follicles resulting in an onion-skin appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The interfollicular stroma is also vascular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. While plasma cell type is characterized by proliferation of plasma cells in interfollicular tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【19】According to clinical presentation CD may be unicentric or multicentric 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–6, 9, 10\\]</u>. The unicentric form is usually of hyaline-vascular type, pauci symptomatic with favorable prognosis and commonly involves the mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Most cases of multicentric CD are of plasma cell type, associated with anemia, fever, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4, 9\\]</u>. Another rare new histologic variant of multicentric CD is plasmablastic type which runs an aggressive course with higher incidence of progression to lymphoma or Kaposi sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The etiology of CD is unclear. There is a strong evidence of HHV-8 participation in development of multicentric CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. It is hypothesized that HHV-8 via production of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is responsible for lymphoplasmacytic and vascular proliferation, and use of blocking antibody against IL-6 receptor may result in symptom resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【21】In our case osseous metaplasia was observed in a lymph node involved by hyaline-vascular type of CD. Among hematologic malignancies, amyloid-producing dyscrasia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were reported to produce heterotopic bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Two theories for this phenomenon are proposed: (i) tumor cells directly differentiate into osteoblasts, (ii) tumor cells secrete substances which induce osteoblastic differentiation in adjacent mesenchymal cells. One of these suggested substances that induce osseous metaplasia in epithelial tumors is bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. BMPs are members of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) which stimulates differentiation of mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts through binding to appropriate receptor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Bull et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> demonstrated that HHV-8 will downregulate BMP-4 (an osteogenic factor), so osseous metaplasia in CD may be produced by other substances. IL-6 is may be the responsible factor. Although this interleukin is considered as a bone resorption factor, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u> it may play a role in bone formation and osteoblast proliferation, too 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 13\\]</u>. Also amyloid deposit may be seen in CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, and this could be site for osseous metaplasia, but no amyloid deposit was seen in our case.\n\n【22】The differential diagnosis of CD is non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (follicular, mantle cell, and marginal zone B cell lymphoma), Hodgkin’s lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and a variety of reactive lymphadenopathies such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren, HIV, and drug sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Unicentric CD is cured by surgical resection, but the course of multicentric CD is chronic, requiring continuous therapy and it may progress to malignant lesions such as lymphoma, plasma cell dyscrasia, or Kapos’ i sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【23】#### 4\\.

Most common initial presentations for multiple myeloma include generalized fatigue, renal insufficiency, bone pain, and recurrent bacterial infections. We present a case of a healthy 55-year-old man that presented to the emergency department with a three-week history of anorexia and jaundice without any past medical history. Patient’s initial labs were significant for hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver function enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT). Additional laboratory workup was significant for mild hypercalcemia and increased protein gap. MRI and ERCP suggested primary sclerosing cholangitis but were not diagnostic. Liver biopsy illustrated plasma-cell infiltration and bone marrow biopsy diagnosed multiple myeloma with extramedullary disease. Patient was started on dexamethasone, bortezomib, and cyclophosphamide, but, despite this aggressive regimen, the patient continued to decline. We take this opportunity to present this atypical presentation of a common hematological malignancy and review the associated literature.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Multiple myeloma accounts for one percent of human cancers, almost two percent of cancer deaths, and 12–15% of all hematological cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder that involves clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in bone marrow, monoclonal protein in the blood or urine, and involved organs. Myeloma is thought to arise from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined clinical significance that progresses to smoldering myeloma and, finally, to symptomatic myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Genetic abnormalities change the expression of adhesion molecules on myeloma cells that allows malignant cells to escape regulatory mechanisms and proliferate autonomously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The diagnosis requires presence of 30% monoclonal bone marrow plasma cells and most common initial presentations include anemia (73%), bony lesions (80%), and renal impairment (20–40%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although multiple myeloma is a malignancy that predominantly affects bone marrow and bone, involvement of extraosseous tissues like spleen and liver is a relatively frequent postmortem finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. The reported incidence of liver involvement in myeloma has been reported to be in the range of 26% to 46% in autopsy studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the incidence of premortem clinical manifestations like hepatomegaly or ascites is much lower. Jaundice is an exceptionally rare way of presentation for myeloma and can be due to several causes: postobstructive to infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. We report a case of a 55-year-old man who presented with jaundice and abdominal pain as the initial clinical manifestations of multiple myeloma.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 55-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with a three-week history of jaundice, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and bloody stools. He also complained of generalized fatigue and anorexia for the previous two months. He denied history of heavy alcohol use, liver disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. He also denied history of allergies and was not on any medication at home. On physical examination he was afebrile and icteric, but there were no other stigmata of chronic liver disease. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were normal. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 7.4 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L with plasma cells noted on the peripheral blood smear, hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 95 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, total bilirubin of 10 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 218 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 96 IU/L, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 47 IU/L. His total protein was 7.7 g/dL, albumin level was 2.4 g/dL, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 82 mm/hour. Prothrombin time (14.1 sec) and INR (1.1) were normal. Serum creatinine was also normal (0.9 mg/dL), but his corrected calcium was elevated at 11.2 mg/dL. HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C antibodies and autoimmune antibodies were negative.\n\n【7】Chest radiography did not demonstrate any focal pulmonary or bony abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasound was significant for hepatosplenomegaly, contracted gallbladder, and hepatic steatosis. Due to patient’s persistent increase in total bilirubin, abdominal MRI was done to evaluate hepatobiliary pathology. Abdominal MRI did not reveal any sign of hepatocellular carcinoma but suggested a chronic intrinsic liver disease with possible sclerosing cholangitic etiology due to presence of focal segmental dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts at the junction of segments IVa and VIII and beading of the right intrahepatic bile duct .\n\n【8】Subsequently, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and colonoscopy to rule out primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease. EGD revealed Grade I esophageal varices with normal gastric and duodenal mucosa. ERCP was significant for small intrahepatic ducts with pruning without any obvious beading or ductal stones/debris . Furthermore, colonoscopy was negative for any sign of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【9】Lastly, the patient underwent liver biopsy which identified neoplastic plasma cells filling the sinusoids of the liver and a bone marrow biopsy that was diagnostic for multiple myeloma (90% kappa light chain restricted plasma cells with 95% cellularity). Serum protein electrophoresis showed a monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Immunoglobulin quantification was IgA 2112 mg/dL, IgG 225 mg/dL, and IgM 21 mg/dL. Flow cytometry revealed predominantly kappa light chains (11.1) in serum along with lambda light chain of 0.62, kappa/lambda ratio of 17.9, urine M-spike of 2.3, LDH 725, and B2-microglobulin 7.54. FISH analysis was significant for gain of 1q21, t(4; 14), 通用删除11(英):<u>(p16; q32)</u>, gain of 15q22, and 17p13 deletion. His disease stage was III according to the International Staging System for multiple myeloma. Upon diagnosis, the patient was started on dexamethasone, bortezomib, and cyclophosphamide; however, his condition continued to deteriorate rapidly with persistent rise in bilirubin, ALP, AST, and ALT. Unfortunately, after three cycles of chemotherapy the patient developed septic shock with encephalopathy and died two weeks later.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Patients with multiple myeloma present mostly with complaints of generalized fatigue, recurrent bacterial infection, weight loss, hematuria, or back pain but rarely of jaundice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 11\\]</u>. The neoplastic plasma cells in multiple myeloma produce monoclonal light chains that frequently deposit in kidney, heart, peripheral nerves, and liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although liver is the second most common organ after kidney to be affected by light chains, most of the patients remain asymptomatic and have mild elevations of liver enzymes early in the disease process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Myeloma presenting as jaundice has been reported in literature but the majority of these cases have been due to hepatic amyloid deposition or extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction secondary to abdominal plasmacytoma or pancreatic head myeloma; few cases of liver dysfunction due to plasma-cell infiltration have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Our patient presented with complaints of anorexia and jaundice without any complaints of back/bone pain, hematuria, or renal failure. Diagnosis was not immediately obvious as patient had severe cholestasis with MRI and ERCP findings suggestive of primary sclerosing cholangitis .\n\n【13】Our case is unique as it highlights a rare presentation for multiple myeloma as obstructive jaundice. Patient denied any symptoms suggestive of multiple myeloma. Admission labs did not reveal anemia or renal insufficiency but were significant for thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, mild hypercalcemia, and increased protein gap. Abdominal MRI and ERCP were suggestive of sclerosing cholangitic etiology. Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in patients with liver disease and increased protein gap can be seen in several diseases ranging from autoimmune to infectious ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Furthermore, primary sclerosing cholangitis may manifest with IgM hypergammaglobulinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Since ERCP was nondiagnostic, liver biopsy was obtained  that led to bone marrow biopsy and, ultimately, to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Though the patient was diagnosed in a timely manner, after presentation, chemotherapy course did not alter the course of disease. With extensive extramedullary disease, our patient did not respond favorably to chemotherapy regimen and continued to deteriorate clinically. The patient developed septic shock with encephalopathy and died two weeks later.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 High power image of liver demonstrating sinusoids packed with atypical plasma cells.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Kappa light chain restriction of the intrasinusoidal plasma cells.</u>\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Positive Staining of intrasinusoidal plasma cells for CD138.</u>\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 ERCP showing pruning of the biliary tree.</u>\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 MRCP significant for right intrahepatic beading.</u>\n\n【19】Incidence of extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma ranges from 7% to 20% on initial presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 10, 15, 16\\]</u>. Most common site for extramedullary disease on diagnosis appears to be skin/soft tissues; however, on follow-up liver seems to be involved more than any other organ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 15, 16\\]</u>. Overall, patients with extramedullary disease tend to have more aggressive disease course, with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Once liver failure is established the prognosis is poor and patient progresses rapidly through jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Though current novel agents have increased overall survival of patients to more than ten years, the biologic and genetic features of multiple myeloma play a crucial role in treatment. Patients with high risk chromosomal aberrations and extramedullary disease, like our patient, have poor prognosis.

They include at least 10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells, serum, or urinary monoclonal protein.\n\n【22】Myeloma-related organ dysfunction (CRAB criteria) is as follows: hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL (2.88 mmol/liter)); renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL (177 umol/liter)); anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or >2 g/dL below the lower limit of the normal range); bone disease (lytic lesions, severe osteopenia, or pathologic fracture).\n\n【23】Staging. The International Staging System is as follows: Stage I: serum B2-microglobulin < 3.5 mg/liter, serum albumin > 3.5 g/dL; Stage II: serum B2-microglobulin < 3.5 mg/liter plus serum albumin <3.5 g/dL or serum B2-microglobulin 3.5 to <5.5 mg/liter regardless of serum albumin level; Stage III: serum B2-microglobulin > 5.5 mg/liter.\n\n【24】Soft-tissue plasmacytomas in multiple myeloma can arise either through direct extension from skeletal tumors or via hematogenous metastatic spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. It is hypothesized that extramedullary spread may be due to decreased expression of adhesion molecules allowing plasma cells to escape bone marrow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Liver infiltration by plasma cells seems to manifest in two distinct patterns: diffuse (sinusoidal, portal, or mixed) and nodular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>; however, the origin of plasma cells in liver is obscure. These cells could be from bone marrow or may have originated and proliferated locally from the reticuloendothelial sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Only observational data are available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Myeloma patients generally have elevated liver enzymes, especially alkaline phosphatase due to heavy plasmacytic infiltration of hepatic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, elevations of liver enzymes do not correlate with the presence of histologic lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Observational studies have shown higher LDH, ALP, CRP, and IL-6 levels with extensive liver involvement in patients with multiple myeloma. However, one cannot simply hold multiple myeloma accountable for elevated liver enzymes in patients with multiple myeloma. The risk of liver dysfunction due to fatty infiltration, hepatocellular necrosis, hemosiderosis, or granulomata is not more increased in multiple myeloma than any other hematological disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Current research is actively exploring genetic abnormalities involved in extramedullary disease as it is associated with decreased overall survival and absence of novel agents specifically for extramedullary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Certain translocations, t(14; 16) and t(14; 20), along with mutations of k-ras and deletions of 17p have already been linked with extramedullary disease involvement. Hopefully, with gene expression profiling, specific extramedullary disease genes can be identified that could become target for treatment modality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Currently, management guidelines do not revolve around extramedullary disease but are circled mostly around the age of the patient and disease activity. Patients under 65 years of age with active disease are started immediately on induction therapy with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or bortezomib plus hematopoietic stem-cell transplant. Patients between 65 and 75 years of age, based on comorbidities, are considered for reduced-dose intensity autologous transplantation. However, patients older than 75 years are rarely considered for stem-cell transplant and therapy dosage is usually reduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:10:35", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:10:57", "cost": 22.132}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:10:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:10:35"}

Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) is a rare clinical disorder, and diagnosing it can be challenging. Most of the patients present with predominant facial, oculo-bulbar, and neck muscle weakness along with respiratory muscle involvement. Such a presentation can be mistaken for bulbar onset motor neuron disease or as one of the rare oculopharyngeal myopathies. Case Report. We present a young female patient, who reported to us with neck muscle weakness, ocular and bulbar muscle paralysis, and breathing difficulty. She had been healthy till she was prescribed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) tablets (400 mg per day) for a malar rash. By the end of the second week after commencing the HCQ therapy, she developed the muscle weakness. Her symptoms began to regress after stopping HCQ and starting steroids, pyridostigmine, and, subsequently, azathioprine. She was negative for anticholinesterase receptor antibodies (AChR-Ab) but was positive for MuSK antibodies (MuSK-Ab). Conclusion. This report proves that MuSK-MG can also be unmasked by HCQ administration. Awareness of drug-induced/-unmasked MG is important, as failure to do so may result in a severe morbidity and a fatal outcome. The offending drug has to be promptly discontinued, and appropriate treatment should be instituted.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) or seronegative MG is a distinct subtype of MG affecting 5–8% of all MG patients. MuSK antibodies belong to the IgG4 class of immunoglobulins, which act by direct inhibition of protein function and AChR clustering 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Hydroxychloroquine is an immunomodulatory agent which is employed by dermatologists for treating lupus erythematosis. This paper presents the case report of a patient who had been prescribed HCQ elsewhere for a malar rash. She developed myasthenic symptoms which was confirmed to be of the MuSK-Mg type, while being on the drug for two weeks. It is well known that HCQ can potentially worsen or unmask MG in a susceptible individual. Prompt identification of the undesirable side effect of HCQ and institution of appropriate treatment relieved her of her myasthenic symptoms.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 34-year-old female university lecturer was admitted for bilateral asymmetrical drooping of eyelids with double vision of 4 weeks duration. She also had fluctuating neck muscle weakness which she thought was due to the long hours of online teaching. However, a few days later, her symptoms became progressively worse. Furthermore, she developed dysphonia, dysphagia, and generalized muscle weakness with shortness of breath on exertion.\n\n【6】On enquiry, she admitted to the fact that she had recently developed maculo-papular rash over her cheeks which was diagnosed as photosensitivity rash. The attending dermatologist prescribed her hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg per day orally which she took for two weeks prior to the emergence of the neurological symptoms. She had no significant past medical illnesses except for 2 episodes of acute simple cystitis that resolved with a single dose of oral fosfomycin, and on both the occasions, no myasthenic symptoms were precipitated. Fosfomycin is a phosphonic acid derivative and has not been listed as an agent that aggravates or triggers myasthenic symptoms in a susceptible individual.\n\n【7】On examination, she was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min. Her oxygen saturation was fluctuating between 86% and 92% necessitating nasal oxygen administration. She had neck muscle weakness and asymmetrical external ophthalmoplegia . Swallowing function was impaired resulting in choking for fluids. There was fluctuating muscle fatigue and double vision on various eye gaze positions. The proximal limb muscle power over both upper and lower limbs was 3/5, and she was unable to sit upright for long. The deep tendon reflexes and sensory examination were normal.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bilateral partial ptosis with overaction of the frontalis muscle.</u>\n\n【9】Based on the history and clinical signs and symptoms, a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was made. This was substantiated by the repetitive nerve stimulation test, wherein at 1 Hz rate stimulation, the orbicularis oculi muscles showed a decremental response consistent with the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis . The AChR antibody titer was reported to be normal, whereas the MuSK antibody titer was high. Computed tomography (CT) of her thorax did not show any thymic enlargement. Blood tests for connective tissue disorders such as the antinuclear antibody (ANA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) were negative.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Decremental response of 10% seen on repetitive stimulation of the facial nerve.</u>\n\n【11】Based on the suspicion of HCQ-triggered myasthenia, the patient was asked to stop the HCQ tablet. She was treated concomitantly with intravenous methylprednisolone (1 gram) daily for 5 days followed by oral prednisolone (30 mg) daily along with pyridostigmine tablet (60 mg) thrice a day. After 10 days, the prednisolone dose was gradually tapered off, and oral azathioprine (50 mg daily) was started. This clinical presentation prompted us to arrive at a final diagnosis of MuSK- MG unmasked by HCQ treatment.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common type of neuromuscular transmission disease, and 85% of the patients have autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) is reported in about 5–8% of MG patients and MuSK.\n\n【14】Antibodies are detected in approximately 37% of generalized AChR antibody-negative myasthenia gravis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【15】This disease is predominantly seen in females in their 3<sup>rd</sup> decade with prominent facial and bulbar involvement and more frequent crises. The onset is usually acute with rapid progression within a few weeks. Bulbar muscle involvement has been demonstrated in up to 80% of the MuSK-MG patients, resulting in dysarthria, dysphonia with nasal voice, dysphagia, and masticatory difficulty. Severe neck muscle weakness presenting as head drop is a feature in Musk-MG. Thus, the patient may be easily misdiagnosed as having bulbar onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, or mitochondrial myopathy.\n\n【16】Case reports on chloroquine-induced MG have appeared in the literature ever since 1981, and most patients have had symptomatic recovery and the disappearance of the AChR antibody after withdrawing chloroquine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Varan et al. in 2015 reported a patient diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus developing myasthenia gravis due to hydroxychloroquine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, when HCQ has been widely used as prophylactic treatment, Elavarsi and Goyal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> reported the exacerbation of myasthenic symptoms in a young AChR-positive myasthenic lady treated with HCQ and emphasized the need for awareness of the possibility of HCQ-induced MG. In 2012, Jallouli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> published a case series of 17 patients with MG and SLE with a special focus regarding hydroxychloroquine usage. It was found that in 8 patients, myasthenia occurred after the initiation of HCQ for the treatment of SLE. However, only one of them was presumed to be due to HCQ, and this patient had a rapid development of myasthenic symptoms though not associated with antibodies against AChR. There was resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of the drug; however, rechallenge with HCQ was not done. Chloroquine, a precursor of HCQ, has been associated with the emergence of myasthenia through production of AChR antibodies causing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) leading to exacerbation of MG through direct effect on neuromuscular transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】HCQ has been used for several decades for various connective tissue diseases, and it has gained popularity over the last one year as a drug for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. These classes of drugs prevent the biocrystallization of heme and impaired neuromuscular transmission both at the presynaptic and postsynaptic levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A systematic review by Sheikh et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> summarizes the various drugs which can cause de novoMG, MG exacerbation, or MG-like symptoms in nonmyasthenic patients.\n\n【18】Whether HCQ can trigger MuSK-MG is also not clearly known, and no reports on such cases have been forthcoming in the literature. Therefore, our case is a rare presentation of MuSK-MG being unmasked by HCQ.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】Our case is rather unique, and it proves to show that HCQ can unmask MuSK-MG also, which has not been hitherto reported in the literature. From a clinical perspective, it is of utmost importance for the treating physician to be aware of such adverse effects of certain drugs such as HCQ and their consequences on the neuromuscular junction. The possibility of MuSK-MG should be entertained in AChR-Ab-negative MG patients, and antibody titer estimation for the MuSK antibody should be performed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:11:00", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:12:24", "cost": 84.649}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:12:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:11:00"}

Presence of a factor-V Leiden mutation in a patient with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) has been reported only once. Here we report the second DM1 patient carrying a factor-V mutation who died from long-term complications of this mutation. Case Report. A 66-year-old DM1 patient with multi-organ-disorder syndrome developed a first deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and consecutive pulmonary embolism (PE) at age 50 y. Acetyl-salicylic acid was given. One year later he experienced a second DVT; that is why phenprocoumon was started. Despite anticoagulation, he experienced a third DVT bilaterally and a second PE bilaterally at 61 y; that is why a vena cava filter was additionally deployed. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation, he experienced a vena cava filter thrombosis at age 62 y. Genetic workup revealed a heterozygous factor-V mutation in addition to a CTG-repeat expansion of 500. As a consequence of PE he developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and experienced recurrent pulmonary infections, which were lastly responsible for decease at age 66 y despite intensive care measures. Conclusion. The heterozygous Leiden mutation may severely affect DM1 patients to such a degree that they die from its complications. If DM1 patients present with unusual manifestations, search for causes other than a CTG-repeat expansion is indicated.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Here we present a DM1 patient with heterozygosity for the factor-V (Leiden) mutation, which lastly was responsible for the fatal outcome of this patient.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient is a 66- year-old Caucasian male, with height 176 cm and weight 77 kg, with a history of cholecystectomy at age 24 y, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism since age 26 y (onset of disease), and steatosis hepatis, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia since at least age 42 y . Since age 42 y, mild cognitive impairment developed. Since age 45 y, bilateral ptosis became apparent. Since at least age 49 y, hepatopathy was evident and he developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). At age 50 y, he experienced a first spontaneous deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with consecutive pulmonary embolism (PE). Acetyl-salicylic acid was given for secondary prophylaxis because of cognitive impairment. Cerebral CT (CCT) showed leukoencephalopathy and pneumosinus dilatans. At age 51 y, he experienced a second spontaneous DVT. Since then oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon was given. Neurologic exam revealed ptosis exclusively. Diagnostic workup for the cause of recurrent DVT revealed the factor-V Leiden mutation in its heterozygous form . Since age 53 y, weakness of the limb muscles developed. Muscle biopsy from the left brachial biceps muscle at age 54 y revealed only nonspecific alterations with some central nuclei and type-II-fiber predominance. Genetic testing at age 55 y revealed a heterozygous CTG-repeat expansion of 500 repeats in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. Prostate hyperplasia became apparent and a synthetic growth factor was applied for growth retardation and short stature during 1 y, without success. At age 59 y, he experienced pneumonia two times. Thrombocytopenia became apparent . Further downstream writing became increasingly impaired. Echocardiography showed aortic insufficiency grade 1 and mitral insufficiency grade 1. Cerebral MRI revealed marked general atrophy and marked leukoencephalopathy . At age 60 y, he experienced vestibular neuronitis but search for acoustic nerve neurinoma was negative. Clinical neurologic exam at age 60 y revealed myopathic face, bilateral hypoacusis, dysarthria, weak head anteflexion (M5-), diffuse weakness (M5-) of the upper limbs, cogwheel rigidity bilaterally, bilateral postural tremor, weakness for hip flexion (M5-), weakness for foot extension (M5-), general diffuse wasting, generally reduced tendon reflexes, and recurrent hyper-CKemia . During hospitalisation, ascites from hepatopathy developed. At age 61 y, he experienced a second PE bilaterally with right-sided infarction pneumonia and a third DVT bilaterally. The INR value was outside the therapeutic range at this event. As a consequence, a vena cava filter was implanted. CCT showed atrophy and leukoencephalopathy. Abdominal CT revealed an atrophic pancreas, a left-sided renal cyst, and prostate hyperplasia. At age 62 y, he experienced thrombosis of the vena cava filter under an INR of 3.0. At age 63 y, he underwent cataract surgery bilaterally. At age 64 y, an AV-block I was documented for the first time. At age 65 y, an event recorder was implanted because of suspected arrhythmias. Recurrent interrogations revealed paroxysmal AFIB. The MMSE was 25. Shortly afterwards he was admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe dyspnea caused by pneumonia with an oxygen saturation of 63% and a pH of 6.92 requiring mechanical ventilation. Since hd1 he developed a striking restless-leg syndrome. On hd12 he underwent tracheostomy. On hd47 he received a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). One day later he was transferred to the neurologic rehabilitation unit. Three days later he again required mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure. He died on hd78 because of sepsis from pneumonia. The patient was a nonsmoker and nonalcoholic. His family history was positive for cataract and glaucoma (father), diabetes (brother of mother), and myocardial infarction (mother). He had one healthy son with gamma-globulin deficiency.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Blood chemical values.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Coagulation parameters.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 MRI of the cerebrum showing diffuse atrophy gliotic spots and leucoaraiosis. Pneumosinus dilatans can be also seen.</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】The presented patient is interesting for several reasons. First, he is only the second patient with a double genetic trouble comprising a CTG-repeat expansion in the DMPK gene and the Leiden mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The first DM1 patient with a Leiden mutation additionally had protein C deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In a further DM1 patient the CTG-repeat expansion was associated with a de novo shortened D4Z4 repeat fragment at the 4q35 locus giving rise to a facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The second point of interest is that he experienced recurrent DVT despite only heterozygous APC resistance. He developed DVT and PE, despite oral anticoagulation and thus required a vena cava filter, and he developed thrombosis of the vena cava filter, despite sufficient anticoagulation. Possibly, the presence of the DMPK mutation enhanced the pathologic effect of the Leiden mutation. It can be speculated that expression of proteins required for the autochthon thrombolysis system was impaired to such a degree that it resulted in a gross prothrombotic effect. It is also possible that the mutated factor-V mRNA was further modified at the posttranslational level by sequestered RNA-binding proteins. It is also conceivable that liver disease favoured the development of DVT, PE, and cava filter thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, history and laboratory investigations were negative for hepatitis, HIV, cholangitis, cholestasis, and storage disease, and abdominal CT did not show liver disease. Secret alcohol consumption was rather unlikely given the absence of red blood cell stigmata. Thus, hepatopathy was most likely attributable to liver involvement in DM1. Though impaired mobility from DM1 has been reported to favour the development of thrombotic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and the patient was lazy, it is rather unlikely that muscle involvement contributed to the etiology of recurrent DVT, since he displayed only mild muscle impairment, also in the leg compartment, and had rather normal mobility.\n\n【12】Third, the patient is interesting for marked central nervous system (CNS) involvement in the disease. He presented not only with dysarthria but also with cognitive decline, extrapyramidal manifestations, cogwheel rigidity, tremor, cerebral atrophy, and leukoencephalopathy, a combination of abnormalities previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–8\\]</u>. Of particular interest are the Parkinson’s features (cogwheel rigidity, impaired writing) in the presented patient since, contrary to DM2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, only few DM1 patients have been reported with manifestations of Parkinson’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Fourth, the patient is interesting for multiorgan disorder syndrome (MODS) affecting the skeletal muscles (ptosis, limb weakness, and weakness of respiratory muscles), the CNS (leukoencephalopathy, cognitive decline, dysarthria, cogwheel rigidity, postural tremor, impaired writing, and cerebral atrophy), the ears (hypoacusis, vestibular neuronitis), the liver (hepatopathy, steatosis, and cholecystolithiasis), the endocrine system (hypogonadism, prostate hyperplasia), the bones (pneumosinus dilatans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>), and the immune system (reduced IgG, reduced IgM, and recurrent pulmonary infections) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Fifth, the patient is the only DM1 patient reported receiving a vena cava filter. Whether this intervention favoured the development of recurrent pulmonary infections remains speculative. A further causative factor of pulmonary infections could be IgG deficiency, frequently found in DM1 patients, or IgM deficiency but also the recurrent PE resulting in COPD could be contributory. Additionally, it is possible that small PE occurred even after anticoagulation and placement of the vena cava filter, favouring recurrent pulmonary infections (infarction pneumonia). It is also conceivable, that PE had been mistaken as pneumonia. Since the patient never complained about dysphagia, microaspiration was rather excluded as the cause of recurrent pulmonary infections.\n\n【15】In conclusion, this case shows that a Leiden mutation, even if present in a heterozygous form, may severely affect DM1 patients to such a degree that they die from its long-term complications. If DM1 patients present with uncommon phenotypic manifestations, search for causes other than a CTG-repeat expansion including other mutations is indicated. Neurologists should be alert to the possibility that individuals having two separate mutations in unrelated genes may develop unusually severe phenotypes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:07", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:59:22", "cost": 14.989}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:59:07"}

In contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV) images of the brain, CVST usually manifests as a filling defect of the dural venous sinuses. Brain parenchymal involvement in CVST can be ranged from parenchymal oedema to haemorrhagic infarctions. Though the most frequent cause of haemorrhagic infarction in brain is CVST, other rare causes such as cerebral venous outflow obstruction due to neck vein pathology have been reported. We report a rare case of haemorrhagic brain infarctions secondary to bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis in a 17-year-old woman, who has presented with worsening headache and seizures. She had high susceptibility of getting venous thrombosis for being a young female on oral contraceptive pills. While reporting a rare cause of cerebral haemorrhagic infarctions, this case report highlights the need for having a high degree of suspicion to diagnose CVST. Further, this case report emphasises the value of prompt and adequate imaging of neck veins if the haemorrhagic infarction presents with patent cerebral venous sinuses.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is an uncommon disease, annually affects nearly 5 per million adults, accounts for 5% of young strokes, and shows female predominance. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of CVST would prevent serious neurological complications. However, a vague presentation of CVST warrants a high degree of suspicion to diagnose early 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The CVST manifests as a filling defect of cerebral veins in contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is as sensitive as CT venography in detecting CVST, in which CVST again manifests as a filling defect in venous sinus. Though the brain parenchymal involvement is not an essential feature of CVST, if present, brain involvement can be ranged from parenchymal oedema to haemorrhagic infarctions. Pathophysiology of brain parenchymal involvement is explained by poor venous drainage and associated high venous pressure that leads to poor arterial perfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Though the most prevalent cause of poor venous drainage in haemorrhagic cerebral infarction is CVST, other rare causes have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here, we report a rare case of bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis as the cause of poor venous drainage that leads to cerebral haemorrhagic infarctions.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 17-year-old married woman presented with three episodes of generalised tonic-clonic seizures. She was confused on admission. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 11: she opened her eyes to verbal command; verbal response was confused; showed withdrawal motor response to pain. She had on and off headaches for the last ten years that worsened to become a persistent headache for the last two weeks. She vomited intermittently for last seven days prior to the admission. Her past medical, surgical, and family histories were unremarkable with no history of abnormal coagulability, malignancy, trauma, or recent infection. Notably, she did not involve in activities that can cause neck trauma or repetitive neck compressions. She was nulliparous and on oral contraceptives for an unknown duration.\n\n【8】On examination, she was afebrile; vital parameters were normal. Except for a low GCS score as described earlier, general, systemic, and neurological examinations were unremarkable. No localising or lateralizing signs were found; the pupils were equally reacting to light. Since she was confused, cognitive behavioural assessment was not performed. Initial blood investigations were normal. Following initial resuscitation, she was transferred to the Radiology unit for computed tomography scan (CT) of the brain.\n\n【9】Initial assessment was performed with noncontrast CT scan of the brain and has shown a large haemorrhagic infarction in the left frontal lobe anteroinferiorly, with minimal oedema of the surrounding brain parenchyma. Even though there was minimal mass effect on the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle, no significant midline displacement was found. Additionally, mild cerebral parenchymal oedema was found in the parasagittal region of the right frontal lobe  with no significant mass effect or midline shift. No evidence of extra-axial or intraventricular haemorrhages was found. The density of dural venous sinuses was equal to the density of the basilar artery; no hyperdensity in venous sinuses to suggest acute dural venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Noncontrast CT brain at presentation, indicating (a) haemorrhagic infarction in the left frontal lobe (black arrow) and (b) focal cerebral oedema in the right frontal lobe (white arrow).</u>\n\n【11】Three days later, her condition further deteriorated: opened eyes only to pain; produced only incomprehensible sounds; limb flexion observed for pain stimulation; frequent seizure episodes not responded to medications. Hence, she underwent pre- and postcontrast-enhanced CT scan of the brain and the neck. Precontrast CT brain has revealed a new haemorrhagic infarction in the right frontal lobe, while the left frontal infarction has involved in size . The CT venography has shown bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis that extends from the jugular bulb to the confluence of subclavian veins . Despite having filling defects in the central part of the veins, periphery of internal jugular veins were opacified with contrast, suggesting partial recanalisation of thrombosed veins. However, the dural venous sinuses and both subclavian veins were patent . Bone window images revealed normal appearance of bilateral styloid processes; there was no impingement of styloid processes on the internal jugular veins.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT brain and neck, indicating (a) haemorrhagic infarctions in both frontal lobes ; oedema in the left occipital lobe with loss of grey white demarcation (arrow head).

Despite adequate treatment, one week after the admission, the patient succumbed due to diffuse cerebral oedema and transtentorial herniation.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】We have presented a rare case of bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis associated with cerebral haemorrhagic infarctions. Though the frequent aetiology of cerebral haemorrhagic infarctions is dural venous sinus thrombosis, in our case extensive neck vein thrombosis was the aetiology. Even though cases with CVST propagating into the internal jugular veins and vice versa have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, isolated internal jugular vein thrombosis manifested as venous infarctions is almost unheard.\n\n【17】The proposed mechanism for cerebral venous (haemorrhagic) infarctions is reduced venous return that leads to high pressure in intracerebral veins. High venous pressure consequently leads to poor arterial perfusion, cell necrosis, and haemorrhages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. If a venous infarction is evident in a patient with patent cerebral venous sinuses, other rare causes of reduced venous return, such as neck vein pathology, have to be excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Typically, patients with internal jugular vein thrombosis or obstruction present with transient facial oedema, with or without associated neck swelling. However, the majority of neck vein thrombosis present with subtle signs such as pain and swelling at the angle of the jaw 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. The atypical presentation of internal jugular vein thrombosis in our patient has rendered the diagnosis difficult. Perhaps, worsening of the existing headache had indicated the onset of internal jugular vein thrombosis. At presentation, the thrombi in internal jugular veins were recanalised indicating subacute presentation. For being a young female who was on oral contraceptives, our patient was considered to be at high-risk category to develop venous thrombosis. Imaging studies to evaluate veins particularly are recommended for the patients with headaches of uncertain diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The incidence of internal jugular vein thrombosis (IJVT) is still unknown, while internal jugular vein catheterisation (incidence 66% of total catheterisations) being the most frequent secondary cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Malignancy, neck trauma, infections, and hypercoagulable status are considered as the other frequent secondary causes of IJVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Similar to our case study, the diagnosis of IJVT can be made with CT or MR venogram studies or with venous Doppler study of the neck. Venogram studies report higher sensitivity rates over Doppler studies due to excellent contrast resolution among soft tissue. CT and MR venogram studies report nearly equal sensitivity in detecting CVST. Contrast-enhanced MR venogram said to be with a higher sensitivity compared to former. Although we have reported cerebral venous infarction, as a rare complication of IJVT, pulmonary embolism (10.3%) and post thrombosis syndrome (14.4%) are considered to be the frequent complications of IJVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】CT imaging of the brain reliably differentiates venous infarctions from arterial infarctions. Contrary to arterial infarctions, venous infarctions are frequently associated with parenchymal haemorrhages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The typical cerebral venous infarctions (in noncontrast CT brain) are flame-shaped heterogeneous (mixed hypo- and hyperdense) areas in the brain parenchyma, which are commonly subcortical in position. The hyperdense areas of the lesion represent parenchymal haemorrhages. Arterial infarctions are wedge shaped, involving both cerebral cortex and medulla, which are usually confined to an arterial territory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Differentiation of arterial infarction from a venous infarction is crucial owing to different patient treatment and management protocols 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The prognosis of CVST is multifactorial. As in our case, the venous thrombosis that present with haemorrhagic infarction delineates an unfavourable outcome. Other factors associated with poor prognosis are old age, deep cerebral vein thrombosis, associated cerebral infection, or a cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Such patients need intense monitoring and treatment to prevent short- and long-term squeal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Identifying the aetiology of venous infarction is empirical for successful patient management. Frequently the aetiology of venous infarction is CVST. In noncontrast CT brain, CVST manifested as hyperdense dural venous sinus. However, venous sinus hyperdensity was seen only in 25% of CVST. False-positive venous sinus hyperdensity can be a typical manifestation in dehydration, increased haematocrit, or the presence of concomitant subarachnoid haemorrhages. Similar to our patient, the dehydrated patients have equal densities in both cerebral arteries and veins.\n\n【23】Presence of CVST can be confirmed using a postcontrast CT scan of the brain, preferably in a CT venography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Typically, the location of cerebral haemorrhagic infarction is related to the site of the CVST. Since the parenchymal changes of CVST is often related to the venous drainage territory of the brain, the site of infarction can be used as a guide to locate the CVST. Often bilateral parasagittal infarctions represent superior sagittal sinus thrombosis; ipsilateral tempero-occipital and/or cerebellar infarctions may represent transverse sinus thrombosis; and bilateral periventricular, basal ganglia, and thalamic infarctions represent deep cerebral vein thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10\\]</u>. Considering all, authors recommend CT or MRI venography of the brain and neck to diagnose or exclude venous thrombosis, for every patient with haemorrhagic infarctions present with patent cerebral venous sinuses. Considering the availability and being able to perform at the bedside, the Doppler study of the neck veins is a complementary option to CT and MR venography. However, the sensitivity of venous Doppler in detecting thrombosed vein is much lower than CT or MR venography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【24】While presenting a rare case of cerebral venous infarction secondary to internal jugular vein thrombosis (IJVT), authors would like to highlight the following limitations. In this case, IJVT is evaluated only with contrast-enhanced CT study, and the majority of radiological features of IJVT would be described if venous Doppler studies of the neck and MR venography are also combined. Confirming the association between venous infarction and IJVT is suggested using an adequate sample of similar cases. Further studies with a sufficient sample size are recommended to evaluate the prognosis and treatment efficacy of IJVT.\n\n【25】#### 4\\.

Bilateral reduction mammoplasty is a common plastic surgery procedure that can be complicated by unfavorable scar formation along incision sites. Surgical adhesives can be utilized as an alternative or as an adjunct to conventional suture closures to help achieve good wound tension and provide an adequate barrier with excellent cosmesis. The recently introduced DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System Skin Closure System combines the skin adhesive 2-octyl cyanoacrylate with a self-adhering polyester-based mesh. Proposed benefits of wound closure with DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System, used with or without sutures, include its watertight seal, easy removal, microbial barrier, even distribution of tension, and reduction in wound closure time. Although allergic reactions to 2-octyl cyanoacrylate have been reported, few allergic reactions to DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System have been noted in the literature.

Six days later, bilateral breast swelling, blisters, and eczematous, erythematous patches near the DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System were noted. Diphenhydramine did not relieve the pruritus. An oral steroid taper pack and hydroxyzine were prescribed. Although the dermatitis was not consistent with a drug rash, the cephalexin was stopped due to the risk for cross reactivity. Steroid taper was discontinued after five days due to gastrointestinal intolerance. At this time, the rash had intensified and spread from chest to arms, neck, and face. All drains and residual DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System were removed; the skin was washed with saline and covered with sterile mesh gauze impregnated with petrolatum 3% bismuth tribromophenate (Xeroform) and petrolatum ointment. A steroid taper was restarted and dermatology consult was made. Two days later, the rash had greatly improved.

One study comparing sutures to DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System in patients did not report any allergic reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In a retrospective study, 4 of 224 patients (1.8%) experienced an allergic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, these patients had prior DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System exposure, suggesting sensitization, consistent with a type IV hypersensitivity or cutaneous allergic contact dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. None of our patients had previous DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System exposure. A limitation of our study is that patients were not patch tested and we cannot rule out contact dermatitis. However, we would expect a greater patient population to demonstrate similar rashes if it were a contact dermatitis. As it has been suggested that DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System not be used for patients with a known or suspected allergy or sensitivity to cyanoacrylate, formaldehyde, tapes, or adhesives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, it would be interesting to determine if individuals with documented skin allergy are more prone to reactions. The likely allergen of DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System, cyanoacrylate, has wide-spread surgical and nonsurgical uses. Thus, patients must be screened for all past allergic reactions. The patients in the prior study were managed via topical corticosteroids and 20% azelaic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Our patients were primarily treated with oral steroids.\n\n【16】In our report, there were no observed wound infections. One study did find a nonstatistically significant increase in infections (2 versus 1 patient) in wounds closed with DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System versus sutures. The authors suggested this could be due to occlusion by DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【17】DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System may be just as, if not more, desirable as sutures. Studies have shown that patients prefer DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System for its aesthetic outcome and decreased pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

Examination revealed areflexia over all four limbs, associated with reduced muscle strength, but no sensory or cranial nerve deficit. Initial concern was Guillain-Barre syndrome given the acute flaccid paralysis following COVID-19 infection. However, investigations revealed severe hypokalaemia (1.7 mmol/L) and primary hyperthyroidism. He was treated for thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) with β\\-blockers, antithyroid medications, and intravenous potassium chloride (KCl). Despite frequent monitoring of potassium, rebound hyperkalaemia occurred with prompt resolution of paralysis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】This is the first case report of TPP occurring after COVID-19 infection, which presented with acute flaccid tetraparesis. COVID-19 infection is associated with multiple complications including neurological, endocrinological, and autoimmune diseases. TPP is an uncommon complication of Graves’ disease and may mimic other neurologic complications of COVID-19 infection such as demyelinating disorders. This emphasises the importance of assessing for metabolic disorders. In patients with severe hypokalaemia, a thyroid panel should be checked, bearing in mind the association between COVID-19 infection and Graves’ disease. Finally, the acute management of patients with TPP and severe hypokalaemia can be challenging, and judicious potassium replacement with frequent monitoring is imperative to avoid rebound hyperkalaemia.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Summary\n\n【5】A previously well 32-year-old Chinese male presented to the emergency department with acute weakness of bilateral upper and lower limbs. He slept well the night before, but was unable to walk or lift his lower limbs upon waking. Upper limb strength was also reduced bilaterally. He had no numbness, facial drooping, slurring of speech, blurring of vision, or incontinence. There was no preceding headache, neck pain, or trauma. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 upper respiratory tract infection ten days ago, and his symptoms of fever, runny nose, cough, and sore throat had since resolved. However, he reported weight loss of 5 kg over the past few weeks. He took a carbohydrate-rich diet mainly consisting of rice, which he had taken the night before as well. He did not notice any neck pain or swelling, palpitations, or diarrhoea. He had no personal nor family history of neuromuscular disease, thyroid disease, or hypokalaemia and was not on any long-term medications or supplements.\n\n【6】On examination, he was afebrile but tachycardic (heart rate 116 beats per minute). Blood pressure was 127/73 mmHg and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. He was alert and conversant with clear speech. Tone was reduced in all four limbs, associated with absent biceps, triceps, supinator, knee, and ankle reflexes. There was profound weakness of his lower limbs and trunk (power 2/5 both proximally and distally), with less severe weakness in his upper limbs (power 3/5proximally, 4/5distally). There was no sensory deficit. Cranial nerves were intact with preservation of respiratory, ocular, and bulbar muscular function. He had a small diffuse goitre that was nontender, with no bruit. Fine tremors were present in both the hands. There were no signs of thyroid eye disease or pretibial myxoedema.\n\n【7】There was initial concern for Guillain-Barre syndrome given his acute flaccid paralysis following COVID-19 infection. Other differentials included hypokalaemic or thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP). Subsequent investigations  revealed severe hypokalaemia (1.7 mmol/L) and primary hyperthyroidism (FT4 28.96 pmol/L; TSH <0.004 mIU/L), establishing the diagnosis of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. TSH receptor antibody was positive (2.4 U/L), consistent with Graves’ disease. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia but no u-waves .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Initial investigations</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Electrocardiogram.</u>\n\n【10】He was transferred to the high dependency unit, placed on telemetry monitoring, and initiated on intravenous (IV) potassium chloride (KCl) replacement. Despite receiving 56 mmol of KCl, his serum potassium level fell from 1.7 mmol/L to 1.6 mmol/L in the first four hours (prior to thyroid function test results). When primary hyperthyroidism was confirmed, he was initiated on oral propranolol 20 mg, carbimazole 20 mg, continued on IV KCl replacement, and serum potassium improved to 2.2 mmol/L. Potassium levels were checked frequently every four hours, and his subsequent potassium rose rapidly to 6.3 mmol/L. This was accompanied by prompt resolution of his paralysis, and muscle strength in all four limbs returned to normal. Potassium infusion was immediately stopped, and he was given IV Actrapid 10 u with 40 ml of 50% dextrose to correct hyperkalaemia. Serum potassium recovered to 4.6 mmol/L. Carbimazole 20 mg OM and propranolol 20 mg TDS were continued, and serum potassium levels remained stable . He was discharged with advice to avoid strenuous exercise and large carbohydrate portions, which may precipitate attacks of TPP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. He will be reviewed in a month to adjust the dosage of carbimazole, with an eventual aim for definitive therapy of Graves’ disease.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Serum potassium trend.</u>\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】This is the first case report of TPP occurring after COVID-19 infection, which presented with acute flaccid tetraparesis. Diagnosis can be a challenge as TPP can mimic neurological complications of COVID-19 infection such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. TPP is an uncommon complication of thyrotoxicosis, rarely affecting Caucasians, and patients tend to have mild clinical and biochemical features of hyperthyroidism, making the diagnosis more difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【14】##### 3.1. Acute Flaccid Tetraparesis Associated with COVID-19 Infection\n\n【15】Multiple neurological complications following COVID-19 infection have been reported, including ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, and acute encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Though rare, cases of acute myelitis and demyelinating disorders (such as Guillain-Barre syndrome) have been reported, giving rise to acute tetraparesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Postulated mechanisms include direct viral invasion of the nervous system, cytokine storm, or molecular mimicry inducing an immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Zuberbühler et al. conducted a review of 48 published cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection, with neurologic manifestations occurring at mean of 12.1 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most patients (87.5%) required treatment with IV immunoglobulin therapy.\n\n【16】This patient’s presentation of acute tetraparesis and areflexia occurring ten days after COVID-19 infection was consistent with Guillain-Barre syndrome. However, it is imperative to exclude metabolic causes such as hypokalaemia or hypocalcaemia. Hypokalaemic and thyrotoxic periodic paralysis occur when there is an intracellular shift of potassium, leading to hyperpolarisation of cell membrane potential, and resultant flaccid paralysis and areflexia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This can lead to the misdiagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome and emphasises the importance of obtaining results of serum electrolytes prior to instituting treatment such as immunoglobulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In TTP, excess thyroid hormone mediates an increase in β\\-adrenergic receptor density and postreceptor mechanisms, which enhances tissue sensitivity to β\\-adrenergic stimulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This leads to increased sodium-potassium ATPase activity on skeletal muscles and an intracellular shift of potassium. Excess thyroid hormone also increases insulin response which in turn stimulates sodium-potassium ATPase activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. TPP is a rare complication of thyrotoxicosis, with an incidence of 0.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. It is more common in Asian populations (incidence of up to 2%), and this may be due to a genetic predisposition or altered sodium-potassium channel mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Like in our patient, it is most often observed in young males between 20 and 40 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【18】There have not been any reported cases of TPP in association with COVID-19 infection thus far. Rajesh et al. reported a case of a 34-year-old male with COVID-19 infection who presented with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The pathophysiology of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis appears to be similar to TPP, with shifts of potassium intracellularly being the main culprit. Association between COVID-19 and thyroiditis has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, postulated to be related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), the receptor for cellular entry of the COVID-19 virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The mRNA encoding for the ACE-2 receptor has been found to be expressed in thyroid follicular cells, making them susceptible to viral entry, which may then give rise to thyroiditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. COVID-19 infection is also known to be a trigger for various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, mainly via molecular mimicry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, and cases of Graves’ disease occurring after COVID-19 infection have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. It is postulated that COVID-19 infection may trigger Graves’ disease by altering the immune system in susceptible individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Although this patient had a history of mild weight loss that preceded his COVID-19 infection, this had not been associated with any other symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, and the onset of paralysis occurred only after the COVID-19 infection.\n\n【19】Thus, this patient’s recent COVID-19 infection may have exacerbated his hyperthyroidism, with his gender, age, and ethnicity making him particularly susceptible to developing TPP.\n\n【20】##### 3.2. Treatment of Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis\n\n【21】Immediate treatment of TPP is necessary to reverse paralysis and prevent cardiopulmonary complications. For treatment of thyrotoxicosis, β\\-blocker therapy is vital in the acute phase, as it inhibits β\\-agonist stimulation and prevents intracellular shift of potassium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This acts as a temporising measure till euthyroidism is achieved. Antithyroid drugs aid to control hyperthyroidism, but ultimately, these patients should be offered definitive therapy to eliminate the risk of subsequent paralysis attacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Management of severe hypokalaemia in these patients can be challenging. These patients are at risk of respiratory muscle paralysis, and fatal arrhythmias have occurred in cases of treatment delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19–21\\]</u>. Hence, immediate potassium replacement must be instituted. At the same time, caution must be exercised to avoid large quantities of potassium. Hypokalaemia in TPP is due to transcellular shift and not a total body deficit from renal or gastrointestinal losses, and reversal of the transcellular shift may lead to rebound hyperkalaemia. Hence, serum potassium levels must be monitored closely throughout replacement. Our case illustrated the difficulty in predicting the degree and rapidity of response to KCl replacement and β\\-blocker therapy. Despite propranolol and carbimazole therapy, as well as 90 mmol of KCl, patient’s potassium level remained extremely low at 2.2 mmol/L with persistent severe paralysis of all limbs. However, a further 40 mmol of KCl replacement resulted in a rapid rise of serum potassium levels to 6.3 mmol/L.\n\n【23】A case-controlled study conducted by Lu et al. demonstrated that recovery time was significantly shorter in subjects with TPP who received IV KCl administration (10 mmol/h) compared to those who did not (6.3 ± 3.8 h vs. 13.5 ± 7.5 h) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. However, rebound hyperkalaemia (>5.5 mmol/L) occurred in 40% of patients who received IV KCl. Another case series of 24 patients with TPP conducted by Manoukian et al. reported that rebound hyperkalaemia (>5.0 mmol/L) occurred in 40%, especially if more than 90 mEq of KCl was given within 24 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Thus, while KCl replacement does hasten recovery in patients with TPP, especially in those with risk of cardiopulmonary compromise, judicious amounts should be used (<10 mmol/h or <90 mmol/24 h), with continuous telemetry and close monitoring for rebound hyperkalaemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 23\\]</u>.\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Conclusion and Learning Points\n\n【25】COVID-19 infection has been described to trigger a myriad of complications, including various autoimmune disorders. In a patient presenting with acute flaccid paralysis following COVID-19 infection, both neurological (e.g. acute myelitis, demyelinating conditions) as well as metabolic (electrolyte disturbances and hypokalaemia) disorders should be considered. Although TPP is a rare entity, a thyroid panel should be checked in COVID-19 patients with severe hypokalaemia, bearing in mind the association between COVID-19 and Graves’ disease. Last, the acute management of patients with TPP and severe hypokalaemia can be challenging, and judicious KCl replacement with frequent monitoring is imperative to avoid rebound hyperkalaemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:29:47", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:29:51", "cost": 3.012}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:29:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:29:45"}

Raising the awareness of clinicians and front-line healthcare workers about the less well-known potential side effects of vaccination is important. We describe the self-limited occurrence of gross hematuria in two elderly men on a combination of aspirin and another antiplatelet or anticoagulant following their second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. While the bleeding seems to be self-limited, the long-term course currently remains elusive.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】While knowledge regarding epidemiologic features, diagnostic tools, and management strategies for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly growing, healthcare systems are still challenged by uncertainties surrounding currently available preventive measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In December 2020, two messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the Emergency Use Authorization pathway in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Published safety and efficacy trials reported high effectiveness at preventing COVID-19-related illness after two interval doses, along with limited side effects and a low rate of adverse reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna Inc. Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. While pain at the site of injection, fatigue, and headache are among the most recognized reported adverse events, little is known about the vaccine’s less frequent potential side effects in the setting of rapid deployment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As COVID-19 vaccinations are now administered globally on a massive scale, rare temporal adverse events are being reported. We describe the self-limited occurrence of hematuria in two patients one day after receiving a second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Patient A\n\n【6】A 71-year-old man was in his usual state of health when he received his second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. The next day, he noted frank blood in his urine. He also reported two episodes of epistaxis. The patient’s past medical history was significant for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction about two months prior to presentation, after which he had been on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. He denied current or past tobacco use.\n\n【7】Vital signs were normal, and the physical exam only revealed dried blood in the right nostril. The urine dipstick showed small amounts of blood. Lab results were significant for a high monocyte count of 1,086 cells/μL (reference range 200–950) . Further urine studies or immunologic assessments were not performed, but the patient was referred to urology. However, he did not establish relationships with them.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory results.</u>\n\n【9】While both hematuria and epistaxis resolved without intervention, the patient’s cardiologist recommended continuing aspirin and holding Plavix for five days. After five days, the patient resumed DAPT and has not had any further bleeding episodes to date. His most recent renal function, about eleven months after the presentation, was normal with a serum creatinine of 0.76 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 91 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.\n\n【10】##### 2.2. Patient B\n\n【11】A 72-year-old man was in his usual state of health when he received his second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. The next morning, he noted “wine-colored” urine. His urine gradually became lighter and was “light pink” by the end of the day. However, he continued to have intermittent dark red urine for the next six days. The only other symptom he endorsed was dull right flank pain.\n\n【12】The patient recalled passing a kidney stone about 22 years prior to the presentation but reported more severe pain at that time. His past medical history was also significant for extensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and atrial flutter. His medications included aspirin (81 mg daily) and rivaroxaban (20 mg daily). While the patient had quit tobacco use 32 years prior to the presentation, he did endorse a 40-pack-year smoking history.\n\n【13】Vital signs were normal, and the physical exam revealed tenderness to deep palpation in the suprapubic region. The urine dipstick showed large amounts of blood. Lab results were significant for mildly elevated levels of INR at 1.2 (reference range 0.8–1.1) .\n\n【14】A urological work-up for painless gross hematuria in the setting of a history of tobacco use revealed a nonobstructing 9 mm stone in the proximal left ureter and a nonobstructing punctate right renal stone. Hematuria resolved after cystoscopy with bladder irrigation.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】The most frequent adverse reactions of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine reported in clinical trials involving more than 30,000 participants were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, and nausea/vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Adverse reactions were reported less frequently in older adults over 65 years of age than in younger individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. COVID-19 Moderna postvaccination bleeding events, including epistaxis, hemoptysis, and vaginal bleeding, have been recorded in the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)’s adverse event reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Since pharmacovigilance data suggest that thrombocytopenia is a frequent postvaccination observation, one proposed mechanism for these bleeding events has been vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Actual COVID-19 infection has also been associated with hematuria. Proposed mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2-mediated hematuria include viral tropism for kidney tissue resulting in tubular obstruction and acute kidney injury by indirect factors (e.g. cytokine-mediated, heme-pigment production) and by a direct viral infection and replication in kidney epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In patients with preexisting, biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, the development of gross hematuria shortly following Moderna vaccination with spontaneous resolution has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In addition to the relapse of preexisting glomerular disease, a wide range of de novo glomerular diseases has been reported shortly after the administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Gross hematuria has been the most common presentation of reported cases of vaccine-associated IgA nephropathy in the literature, followed by acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 10\\]</u>. In the majority of patients, hematuria was self-limited and seldom required immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 10\\]</u>. While the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated, it has been proposed that mRNA-based vaccines result in more robust and/or nonspecific immune activation that may trigger, unmask, or exacerbate autoimmune processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, three cases of nephrolithiasis were reported in association with mRNA-based vaccines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Interestingly, a recent retrospective study in Switzerland did not find a statistically significant association between mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination and an increased incidence of four common glomerulonephritis types (i.e. IgA nephropathy, pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease, and membranous nephropathy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The authors of this study concluded that most cases of new-onset glomerulonephritis manifesting shortly after COVID-19 vaccination are likely the result of temporal coincidence as opposed to causality. They also commented that their findings could not exclude an effect of vaccination on the development of minimal change disease, but the absolute risk would be very small 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Unfortunately, neither one of our patients underwent further urine studies (microscopic urine analyses, quantification of proteinuria), nor a renal biopsy, and therefore, it is not known whether there was any underlying glomerular disease. Furthermore, the association between vaccination and hematuria is only temporal. Similar to the majority of macrohaematuria episodes reported in the literature in association with the COVID-19 vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, our patients’ symptoms began within 2 days after the second vaccination dose. Both patients had normal platelet counts. The hematuria in the patient with nephrolithiasis could certainly have been caused by the kidney stones and his medications. He was on aspirin and rivaroxaban, while the other patient was on aspirin and clopidogrel. Certain medications, such as anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, may increase the risk of postvaccination bleeding; nevertheless, the bleeding resolved itself in both cases. Furthermore, while recurrent hematuria has been reported in some individuals after subsequent doses of the same vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, both our patients have since received and tolerated the Moderna vaccine booster.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【20】We hope that this correspondence will raise the awareness of clinicians and front-line healthcare workers about the possibility of a potential association between new-onset hematuria and mRNA-based COVID vaccines. It is possible that patients and clinicians do not recognize these events as vaccine-related. We strongly encourage reporting these postvaccination events to clarify their true incidence. Moreover, if an association with the vaccine is established and bleeding events remain self-limited, important implications include circumventing the cessation of potentially life-saving medications in patients without persistent hematuria, worsening renal function, or other systemic signs and symptoms. A close follow-up and additional workup are warranted to rule out underlying urologic, nephrologic, or hematologic etiology(ies) with relevant long-term health implications that may have been unmasked by the vaccination. Furthermore, some authors have suggested consideration of an alternative vaccine class for subsequent immunization of patients with vaccine-associated hematuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:48:13", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:48:23", "cost": 9.788}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:48:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:48:11"}

Interestingly, despite bcl-2 expression being a poor prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors, the patient with this tumor has achieved long-term survival (approximately 6 years) at the time of writing this report. Because previous investigators reported that bcl-2 expression might play a role in the inhibition of the development of breast cancer, we suggest that bcl-2 expression might reflect a good prognosis in patients with SPC, rather than being a poor prognostic indicator, as it is in several types of neuroendocrine tumor. However, to confirm this hypothesis, further investigation is required.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 62-year-old Japanese woman presenting with a mass in the left breast was admitted to Japanese hospital for evaluation of this lesion. Mammography showed a high-density mass, and breast ultrasonography showed well-demarcated, highly abundant blood flow and a cystic lesion . Because these results indicated the presence of a malignant tumor, fine-needle aspiration cytology and needle biopsy were performed. Aspiration cytology indicated a lesion suspicious for carcinoma . If tumor cells show ill-defined rosette formation, these findings indicate solid papillary carcinoma. But actually this is not 100% proven. We therefore conducted needle biopsy that suggested ductal carcinoma. Consequently, the patient underwent partial mastectomy of the left breast with lymph node dissection. Our patient’s surgical intervention had a successful outcome—neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis occurred, and she maintains a high quality of life 70 months after the operation.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 A breast ultrasonography image shows well-demarcated, highly abundant blood flow and a cystic lesion.

Histopathologically, the tumor cells show a solid papillary growth pattern, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, and a round to elongated nucleus plus finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells usually show positive reactivity for neuroendocrine markers, including synaptophysin and chromogranin A. In addition, these tumors generally show positive reactivity for ER and PgR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Several types of low-grade ductal carcinomas should be considered as differential diagnoses for SPC. In particular, papillary carcinoma is similar to SPC in many respects. Namely, it arises in elderly patients, grows in large well-circumscribed ducts, and is characterized by a good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, this tumor differs from SPC by the presence of delicate papillae, a branching pattern, a cuboidal to columnar appearance of the tumor cells, and the lack of a solid growth pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 11\\]</u>. Certain benign intraductal tumors should be considered because of their solid or papillary intraductal epithelial growth pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 11\\]</u>. However, a uniform cell population, increased mitotic activity, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, and intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition are not usually seen in benign intraductal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 11\\]</u>. Furthermore, the importance of the confirmation of neuroendocrine differentiation has often been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In the present paper, the tumor cells followed the characteristic features of SPC, including a solid papillary growth pattern, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, a round to elongated and hyperchromatic nucleus, finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, and intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition, as well as positive reactivity for synaptophysin, but without positive reactivity for chromogranin A.\n\n【16】The immunohistochemical examination findings of this tumor are worthy further discussion. Ki-67 is known as a prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 17, 21, 22\\]</u>. Kawasaki et al. reported that the Ki-67 labeling index of nonneuroendocrine DCIS (8.1%) was significantly higher than that of neuroendocrine DCIS (4.3%), and they concluded that a low Ki-67 labeling index is correlated with a good prognosis in patients with neuroendocrine DCIS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In fact, our patient showed an exceptionally low Ki-67 labeling index (3.7%). In addition, several studies on neuroendocrine tumors have reported that bcl-2 or p53 expression might be correlated with malignant behavior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–17, 19, 23–27\\]</u>. However, no studies were found in which investigation was limited to SPC. Therefore, we tried to establish the immunohistochemical prognostic indicators of SPC by using bcl-2 and p53, which are acceptable prognostic indicators in several types of neuroendocrine tumor. As a result, the tumor cells showed negative reactivity for p53, which may reflect a good prognosis in patients with SPC. However, the tumor cells showed positive reactivity for bcl-2, which is a poor prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【17】To explain this paradoxical result, we considered the meaning of bcl-2 expression in breast cancer. Won et al. reported that beclin-1 and bcl-2 expression might play a role in the inhibition of the development of breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Therefore, we suggested that bcl-2 expression also reflexes the good prognosis of the patients with SPC rather than prognostic indicators in several kinds of neuroendocrine tumor. Unfortunately, our immunohistochemical examinations are based on only one patient with SPC. To confirm this hypothesis, further investigation is required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:19:00", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:19:07", "cost": 7.28}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:19:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:18:59"}

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 43-year old Japanese man was referred and admitted with a continuous spiking fever, myalgia, and arthralgia. Physical examination revealed fever, muscle weakness, and salmon-pink rash . Laboratory examination was notable for a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 1.1 mg/dL (normal range, 0.0–0.3), a fibrinogen level of 504 mg/dL (normal range, 150–400), a creatin kinase (CK) level of 1.114 IU/L (normal range, 55–200), and a ferritin level of 2.892 ng/mL (normal range, 40–350). Serum rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antigen, proteinase 3 (PR3)- and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), and anti-Jo-1 antibody were negative.

Discussion\n\n【12】To our knowledge, the histopathology of evanescent salmon-pink rash has not been cleared. A skin biopsy revealed that rash was due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is characterized by angiocentric segmental inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis, and a neutrophilic infiltrate around the vessel walls with erythrocyte extravasation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis has been observed in Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and microscopic polyangiitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>; however, it has not been reported in AOSD. Negative PR3- and MPO-ANCA denied complication with Wegener’s granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis in our patient.\n\n【13】vWF is produced by blood vessel endothelial cells in response to injury, and high vWF level has been observed in systemic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. VEGF is a cytokine participating in inflammation with potent endothelial effect and is produced by macrophages, neutrophils, and vascular endothelial cells and can alter vascular permeability. VEGF has also been suggested to be associated with vasculitis, and elevated serum VEGF levels have been observed in Behçet's disease, microscopic polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and giant cell arteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–12\\]</u>. Elevated blood vWF and VEGF levels in our AOSD patient suggest a significant association between AOSD and vasculitis. We have to mention that VEGF immunostaining on the cutaneous lesion would be more relevant than serum VEGF measurement, and that we did not study serum vWF and VEGF levels after the therapy; however, investigation of changes in their levels after the corticosteroid therapy would be helpful to show their role in the pathogenesis of vasculitis in this patient.\n\n【14】Liver dysfunction in AOSD has been ever described in some case reports. Andrès et al. retrospectively reviewed data of 17 patients with AOSD and found abnormalities in liver biochemistry in 76% of subjects with AOSD, suggesting the high frequency of liver dysfunction in AOSD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, it is difficult to differentiate liver dysfunction due to AOSD itself from drug-induced liver dysfunction. Recently, Chen et al. determined soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) in patients with active untreated AOSD and identified serum sICAM-1 level as a predictor of liver dysfunction in AOSD, and serum sICAM-1 levels were significantly correlated with disease activity and serum ferritin levels which have been also reported to be suitable for monitoring AOSD disease activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In our subject, in spite of decrease in serum CRP and ferritin levels, serum AST and ALT levels were increased by NSAIDs and were promptly decreased by corticosteroid, suggesting the presence of drug-induced liver dysfunction. In this case, NSAIDs also elevated serum CK levels, and a 20 mg corticosteroid therapy promptly decreased serum CK levels, suggesting NSAIDs-induced myositis. To our knowledge, drug-induced myositis in AOSD has not been previously reported. Schwarz-Eywill et al. have also observed that aspirin improved symptoms and CRP but increased serum AST and ALT levels in AOSD patients, and a corticosteroid treatment decreased serum AST and ALT levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. AOSD may have a potential mechanism for enhancing drug toxicity. If we find deterioration in liver function and myositis during treatment, in spite of decrease in CRP and ferritin, we should be aware of drug-induced hepatitis and myositis in AOSD.\n\n【15】In conclusion, our observation indicates that AOSD may be associated with systemic vasculitis and also suggests that we should be aware of the presence of drug-induced hepatitis and myositis in AOSD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:02:42", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:04:09", "cost": 86.792}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:04:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:02:42"}

Among them, interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the most common and severe extra-articular manifestations, with a negative impact on both therapeutic approach and overall prognosis. ILD can occur at any point of the natural history of RA, sometimes before the appearance of joint involvement. Since no controlled studies are available, the therapeutic approach to RA-ILD is still debated and based on empirical approaches dependent on retrospective studies and case series. Here, we report the case of a 75-year-old patient affected by RA complicated by ILD successfully treated with a combination therapy of an antifibrotic agent, nintedanib, and an inhibitor of IL-6 receptor, sarilumab. We obtained a sustained remission of the joint involvement and, simultaneously, a stabilization of the respiratory symptoms and function, with a good safety profile. To date, this is the first report describing a combination therapy with nintedanib and a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for the management of RA complicated by ILD. Future prospective studies are needed to better define efficacy and safety of this approach in the treatment of these subjects.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

It is characterized by chronic, symmetrical, erosive synovitis and sometimes by extra-articular manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Among them, lung involvement is common and includes a wide spectrum of disorders ranging from airways and pleural disease, bronchiectasis and nodules, to infection and drug toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common lung involvement, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 4 to 30%, and significantly affects the therapeutic approach, quality of life, morbidity, and mortality of RA patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The treatment of RA-ILD is still debated, and it is mainly based on corticosteroids and immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Usual interstitial pneumonia is the more frequent ILD pattern observed in RA, followed by nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (more typical of connective tissue disease, CTD). Although RA-UIP is frequently reported to have a better prognosis than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), its role on the prognosis of RA-patients is not yet well defined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Nintedanib is a small molecule triple tyrosine-kinase inhibitor approved as an antifibrotic agent for the treatment of IPF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.

Case Report\n\n【8】A 75-year-old man, former smoker (40 pack-years, until 2007), was referred to the Respiratory Unit of our university hospital because of the appearance of a persistent and productive cough associated with worsening dyspnea on exertion in November 2016. His past clinical history revealed the presence of ischemic heart disease treated with triple percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, type 2 diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\n【9】He underwent high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) with the detection of reticular ILD characterized by bibasal thickening of the interstice and interlobular septa associated with traction bronchiectasis.\n\n【10】At the time of diagnosis, FVC was normal (FVC 109%), while the diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide test (DLCO) was severely reduced (DLCO Sb 35%). Echocardiography was not suggestive for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The patient showed digital clubbing at physical examination and chest auscultation revealed velcro crackles.\n\n【11】For the detection of low-titer anti-citrullinated peptides antibodies (ACPA) (89 UI/mm), he was referred to our Rheumatology Unit. The patient did not complain arthritis, sicca syndrome, Raynaud phenomenon, or other symptoms, or sign related to inflammatory arthritis, or CTDs. Both Schirmer test and nailfold capillaroscopy were negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), antinuclear antibodies (ANA) including extractable nuclear antigen (ENA), and anti-granulocyte antibodies (ANCA), and rheumatoid factor (RF) were all negative.\n\n【12】A surgical lung biopsy confirmed the presence of a UIP pattern, showing an altered architecture due to “honeycombing” aspects accompanied by mild to moderate chronic interstitial inflammation. A diagnosis of IPF was performed, and the patient began a treatment with nintedanib (150 mg twice daily), which was well tolerated.\n\n【13】In December 2017, he was newly referred to our Rheumatology Unit for the appearance of inflammatory arthralgias involving small joints of the hands and swelling of the left wrist associated with an increase in ESR and CRP (30 mm/h and 24 mg/l, respectively) and the presence of rheumatoid factor (174 IU/ml) besides ACPA. The disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS-28-CRP) was 3.96 (moderate disease activity). Ultrasound confirmed the presence of bilateral arthritis of the wrists with power-Doppler positivity. A diagnosis of RA was performed according to 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and we started a low-dose steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 4 mg/daily) and hydroxycloroquine (200 mg twice daily), in association with nintedanib, was decreased to 100 mg twice daily because of the appearance of drug-related diarrhea.\n\n【14】In February 2019, an arthritis relapse occurred involving small joints of the hands and the knees. ESR and CRP (36 mm/h and 21 mg/l, respectively) increased again (DAS 28 6.71).\n\n【15】A suspected progression of lung fibrosis at HRCT was also observed, with an increase of fibrosis in the midbasal and in the subpleural and periscissural areas, and an increase in traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing aspects, even if symptoms and respiratory function remained stable . X-rays of the hands showed typical bone erosions in several metacarpophalangeal joints.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Clinical case summary.

Discussion\n\n【19】ILD has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality and represents a current challenge in the therapeutic approach to RA. Treatment, mainly based on corticosteroids and immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, is not well defined and efficacy data are not still available. On the other hand, the supposed role of many conventional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the onset or worsening of preexisting ILD in RA further complicates the therapeutic choice for these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Nintedanib is an antifibrotic agent approved for the treatment of IPF, and recently its efficacy has been demonstrated also in secondary forms of fibrosing ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. It inhibits the signal transmission at vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and fibroblast growth factor receptors associated with proliferation, migration, and transformation of fibroblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【21】There is an increasing interest about the possible role of nintedanib in the treatment of progressive ILD other than IPF. Because of clinical and radiological similarity between RA-ILD and IPF, it is expected that nintedanib could produce similar effects in slowing the progression of the disease. Preclinical data support a possible effect of nintedanib in fundamental processes of lung fibrosis, and that the antifibrotic activity is independent of the cause of the fibrosing lung disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–14\\]</u>. Furthermore, the frequent association between UIP and RA allows us to speculate that nintedanib might also have efficacy in RA-ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【22】A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial (INBUILD trial) recently assessed the efficacy and safety of nintedanib (150 mg twice daily) versus placebo in 663 patients with a diagnosis of ILD other than IPF, including subjects affected by RA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Patients eligible for the study presented features of diffuse fibrosing lung disease affecting more than 10% of lung volume on HRCT; moreover, they showed disease progression in the last two years before screening, according to FVC, respiratory symptoms, or HRCT. In particular, the study population included a subgroup of patients with UIP-like pattern, namely, patients with reticular abnormalities and traction bronchiectasis with or without honeycombing on HRCT (412 patients, 62.1%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The patients who received nintedanib showed a slower progression of ILD compared to placebo, as shown by lower decline in the annual rate of FVC over the 52-week period, both in overall population and in UIP-like fibrotic patterns group. Interestingly, the absolute treatment effect of nintedanib in this study was similar in magnitude to those observed in pooled data from the INPULSIS trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【24】To our knowledge, this is the second report of a patient with RA-ILD treated with nintedanib, and for the first time, we describe the association between nintedanib and a biologic DMARD.\n\n【25】Kakuwa et al. described, for the first time, a 74-year-old man presenting the UIP pattern at HRCT who was diagnosed with IPF and subsequently developed an inflammatory articular involvement typical of RA, with positivity of ACPA and RF.

Abdominal pregnancy is a rare condition in which early termination is generally recommended. However, there are cases of abdominal pregnancies treated using expectant management with satisfactory outcomes. This management may be considered in special cases, such as previously infertile couples. Case. A case of a 27-year-old woman with infertility history complaining of vaginal bleeding was presented. Physical and ultrasound examination revealed an abdominal pregnancy with 18 weeks of gestation. Although she was ready to abort the pregnancy, she insisted to try expectant management for her pregnancy. Her baby was finally born at 25 weeks via laparotomy. Conclusion. Abdominal pregnancy is a rare and highly morbid form of ectopic pregnancy. It demands a skilled approach in management. A comprehensive and holistic approach is required to deliver the best outcome for the patient and her family.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Infertility is a common clinical problem affecting 10–15% of all couples worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Infertility is not only a medical problem but also is considered a social problem. There are many impacts of infertility on a couple and their environment. The feeling of depression, grief, guilt, and shame may become an additional problem, along with social isolation experienced by those suffering from infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Abdominal pregnancy is a form of ectopic pregnancy of which the sites of implantation included Douglas pouch, omentum, pelvic sidewall, bowel, liver, diaphragm, and large pelvic vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The abdominal pregnancy rate ranges between 1 : 10,000 and 1 : 30,000 in the population, representing 1% of all extrauterine pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Main risk factors for abdominal pregnancy include tubal damage, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, assisted reproduction techniques, and multiparity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Abdominal pregnancy is rather difficult to be distinguished from a tubal pregnancy or even a normal pregnancy. Early surgical termination is generally recommended to avoid further maternal risks. However, there are also cases of live birth following conservative management of abdominal pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is deemed as highly morbid and usually reserved for special populations, one of which is couples with the history of infertility.\n\n【6】This study aimed to present a case of a biopsychosocial approach for conservative management of abdominal pregnancy in previously infertile couple.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【8】A 27-year-old G1 woman with 18<sup>th</sup> weeks of gestation came to our obstetrics and gynecology policlinic with chief complaint of abnormal vaginal discharge since a day prior. There was no complaint of vaginal bleeding, urinary problem, nor defecation problem. Previously, she had her routine antenatal care at an obstetrician located in another city. Previously, she thought she had normal pregnancy. However, it was known that her pregnancy was an abdominal pregnancy since 3 weeks ago (15<sup>th</sup> weeks of gestation). Afterward, she was referred to other hospital in our city. She then routinely took her antenatal examination every 2 weeks.\n\n【9】Previously, her husband and she were suffering from 3 years of primary infertility. She had never used any kind of contraceptive. Her prior medical condition and her family history were also unremarkable.\n\n【10】The patient’s vital sign was stable at the time of arrival. Physical examination revealed her fundal height matched the gestational age. Her fetal heart rate was 145 times per minute, while her vaginal discharge was identified as flour albus, suspected to be caused by bacterial vaginosis. Her laboratory results revealed mild microcytic hypochromic anemia and mild hypokalemia.\n\n【11】Ultrasonographic examination revealed singleton abdominal pregnancy with normal biometry and normal activity. The gestational sac was located in the pouch of Douglas, while the placenta was implanted at the omentum. There was no congenital anomaly identified on the fetus .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Ultrasonographic image of the abdominal pregnancy.</u>\n\n【13】A family meeting consisting of the patient, her husband, and the obstetricians was commenced following the examination. She was told that abdominal pregnancy was a highly morbid form of ectopic pregnancy; thus, there were significant risks associated with it. However, she was also told that there might be hope for satisfactory maternal and fetal outcomes. She told the obstetricians that her husband and she were suffering badly due to her previous infertility. They also experienced being gossiped by their families and neighbors. Therefore, she hoped that she can retain her pregnancy as they were unsure if she could have any other pregnancy. Eventually, the meeting ended with agreement of trying expectant approach for the pregnancy.\n\n【14】She was a housewife, while her husband was a merchant at a traditional market. Although they are suffering from their previous infertility, they could not afford to seek out medical help due to financial problem. Moreover, there was no sufficient medical infrastructure to address their problem in their city. On the third day following the meeting, there was no complaint remained. She was then discharged and planned to have antenatal care every 2 weeks at our center.\n\n【15】She had her antenatal care on our center. There was no sign of complication on the examination. Ultrasonographic exam showed estimated fetal weight of 297 g and placenta was implanted to omentum. It corresponded to 19 weeks of gestational age. During US Doppler examination, there was a absent end diastolic in the umbilical artery. Based on the data, additional heparin was initiated.\n\n【16】During her 25<sup>th</sup> gestational week, reverse A wave ductus venosus with brain sparing effect and reverse end diastolic umbilical artery was found. It was decided to deliver the fetus via laparotomy. Due to placenta implantation on the mesenteries, the laparotomy was done with assistance of digestive surgeons.\n\n【17】During the surgery, abdominal gestational sac was seen, covered by the right broad ligament, behind the uterus, filling the Douglas cavity. The uterus was slightly enlarged in front of the abdominal gestational sac. After delivering the baby, the placenta was seen to be implanted on the lateral side of the posterior uterine. Thus, placenta was left in site in order to prevent massive hemorrhage. The abdomen was then closed .\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Abdominal gestational sac. (b) The placenta. (c) Delivering the baby. (d) The placenta left in site.</u>\n\n【19】The baby was sent to neonatal intensive care unit for further evaluation and treatment. Meanwhile, the mother was observed for 24 hours at intensive care unit and discharged two days following the surgery. Two days later, the baby died due to respiratory distress.\n\n【20】A year after the surgery, the mother was alive and well. Upon follow-up examination, the placenta left was already reduced in size, while the mother had started another pregnancy program.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】##### 3.1. Biological Aspect\n\n【23】Infertility is a common problem affecting up to 15% of all couples worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It was categorized into primary (for those not having children prior to the infertility) and secondary infertility. It was associated with several medical problems arising from both the men and women. According to previous study, the most common causes of infertility are sperm abnormalities, ovulation dysfunction, and tubal pathology. However, a few of the cases remain unexplained 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our case, the patient and her husband experienced primary infertility, which pushed them to try to retain the abdominal pregnancy as they were unsure if the patient could have any other pregnancy.\n\n【24】Abdominal pregnancy is a rare event but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The incidence varies widely with geographical location, degree of antenatal attendance, level of medical care, and socioeconomic status. It is believed that abdominal pregnancy is more common in developing countries, probably because of the high frequency of pelvic inflammatory disease in these areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Besides, it may be due to low socioeconomic status, history of infertility, tubal sterilization, tubal reconstruction surgery, and pregnancy with intrauterine device 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Abdominal pregnancy is also associated with maternal mortality rate of 0.5–18% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The maternal mortality rate was 7.7 times higher than that observed in tubal ectopic pregnancies and 90 times higher than in an intrauterine pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Several studies considered that expectant management is possible, while others proposed that there is a high risk for a life-threatening hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Therefore, early surgical termination is advised to all abdominal pregnancy patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, there were cases of expectant management for abdominal pregnancies with satisfactory results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 10\\]</u>. Although there were cases of successful expectant management for abdominal pregnancies, it is usually reserved for special populations, one of which is previously infertile couples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Our patient in this case also experienced primary infertility prior to this pregnancy. However, the neonate died shortly after birth in this study. Therefore, we recommend that abdominal pregnancy be diagnosed and preferably terminated early to prevent further complications.\n\n【26】##### 3.2. Psychologic Aspect\n\n【27】Infertility has devastating consequences to a couple psychology. Due to infertility involving an inability to achieve the desired social role as “parents,” infertility is associated with severe psychological distress for a couple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. This problem creates stress for the couple, increasing the risk of developing anger, depression, anxiety, and various marital problems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Ironically, the psychological problems associated with infertility often increase sexual dysfunction and social isolation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Along with the stress associated with the infertility itself, there is considerable stress associated with those undertaking in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other forms of infertility treatment. A previous study mentioned that the clinical depression rates of women trying to conceive using IVF are similar to those having heart disease or even cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Therefore, psychologic assessment and guidance should be delivered to all infertile patients.\n\n【29】Abdominal pregnancy in our case also added additional psychologic burden to our patient and her husband. After three years of waiting, they had to accept the fact that their baby might not survive and the patient had to shoulder the additional risks associated with abdominal pregnancy.\n\n【30】##### 3.3. Social Aspect\n\n【31】Infertility remains as a social problem worldwide. Due to the traditions of some countries, infertility is associated with a social stigma of being “imperfect,” especially for the women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It is caused by patriarchy developed in many countries. Although recent medical advances have shown that there are as many cases of which male factor is the main factor of infertility, the societies continue to blame women as the “perpetrator” of infertility. Moreover, this phenomenon is often accompanied with the normalization of polygamy practice due to infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【32】There are many patients not receiving the recommended medical care according to several guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The suboptimal management may be caused by several factors, namely, the reluctance of the patients, the cost of infertility treatment, and the availability of proper medical infrastructure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In our case, the patient and her husband had not taken any steps to address their infertility problem due to the high cost and unavailability of proper medical infrastructure in their city. Moreover, her husband worked as a merchant at a traditional market, thus accompanying her wife to other city meant no income for their family.\n\n【33】On the other hand, in abdominal pregnancy, we try to joint with the stockholder in their around home to help if there is any emergency situation and ready to bring her to the RSCM Hospital.\n\n【34】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【35】Abdominal pregnancy is a rare and highly morbid form of ectopic pregnancy. It demands skilled approach in management. Early diagnosis and termination are preferable to ensure the best outcome for the mother. Comprehensive and holistic approach is required in order to deliver the best outcome for the patient and her family.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:45:39", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:46:04", "cost": 24.285}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:46:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:45:38"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Moyamoya-like angiopathy (also called moyamoya syndrome) is a rare intracranial complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and hypothyroidism. However, the treatment strategy for moyamoya syndrome complicated with such chronic systemic vascular disease remains controversial. In this paper, we present a case of moyamoya syndrome associated with SLE and hypothyroidism with onset of cerebral ischemia, which was effectively treated by encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS).\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 54-year-old woman, who had undergone treatment for SLE and hypothyroidism for 20 years by continuous steroid administration (prednisolone 5 mg/day), experienced repeating cataplexy of the right arm for 6 months and visited neurologists at our hospital. She was diagnosed with occlusion of the left internal carotid arteries (ICA) and cerebral ischemia of the left watershed area between the frontal and temporal lobe, and treatment with antiplatelets (acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg/day and cilostazol 100 mg/day) was initiated. The symptoms transiently improved, but recurred soon after. An increased dose of antiplatelets was administered (acetylsalicylic acid 200 mg/day and cilostazol 200 mg/day), but no improvement in her symptoms was observed. Subsequently, she was admitted to the department of Neurosurgery for intracranial revascularization surgery.\n\n【6】Preoperative head magnetic resonance imaging indicated cerebral infarction of the frontoparietal watershed area . Carotid echogram indicated shrinkage of the left ICA towards the distal end, starting at the level of carotid bifurcation without vascular wall thickening , compared with the right ICA ; the possibility of steroid-induced atherosclerosis as the cause of this left ICA occlusion was dismissed. And, left cervical digital subtraction angiography (DSA) also indicated stenosis and winding of the left cervical ICA towards the distal intracranial lesion . Head DSA of the right ICA indicated no abnormality . However, DSA of the left common carotid artery indicated the occlusion of the left ICA just after the bifurcation of the posterior communicating artery, deficit of the left anterior cerebral artery and the left middle cerebral artery, development of moyamoya-like vessels in the left basal ganglia , and leptomeningeal anastomosis from the left posterior cerebral artery to the perfusion area of the left anterior and middle cerebral artery . Analysis of <sup>99m</sup>Technetium-ethyl-cysteinate-dimer single-photon emission computed tomography (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT) imaging of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) using three-dimensional stereotactic region of interest template highlighted a reduced level of CBF in the left hemisphere under acetazolamide loading, compared with the right hemisphere .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging axial T2-weighted image (a) and coronal FLAIR image (b).

Preoperative CBF increase rate under diamox stress was impaired more around the central sulcus than on the ipsilateral side (2.2% and 10.8%, resp.).

EDAS—a method of revascularization surgery—is an indirect procedure and was chosen because this case was complicated by the systemic progressive vascular disease that was treated with steroids, and the preoperative status of the left middle cerebral artery, which was not visualized by DSA, was not known.\n\n【12】The postoperative course was uneventful, and the cataplexy of the right upper limb had nearly disappeared.

Discussion\n\n【15】Intracranial moyamoya-like vessels complicated with systemic vascular disease or immunological disorders, such as in this case, are diagnosed as “moyamoya syndrome,” rather than true moyamoya disease according to the precise criteria, and the exact pathology remains unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Natori et al. named this vasculopathy as “angiographical moyamoya” and indicated the relationship between the pathogenic mechanisms of moyamoya syndrome and true moyamoya disease at the genetic level in their report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Complication of SLE with moyamoya syndrome is rare, and only 3 or more cases of moyamoya syndrome complicated with SLE have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>, which were treated by direct or indirect bypass surgery. Most disorders of large cerebral vessels associated with SLE are reported as thrombus, dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitis, and atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Another possible pathogenic mechanism for moyamoya syndrome complicated with SLE is progressive atherosclerosis induced by continuous steroid treatment for SLE. Given that we observed gradual stenosis of the ICA from the cervical level towards the distal end without wall thickening , it is unlikely that the pathogenesis for our case is steroid-induced atherosclerosis. The cases of moyamoya syndrome complicated with hypothyroidism are reported as Sjögren’s syndrome with cerebral moyamoya vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 8\\]</u>. In these cases, autoimmune disorder is suggested as the common pathogenesis between moyamoya syndrome and Sjögren’s syndrome. However, despite these findings, the correlation in the pathogenesis of moyamoya syndrome and SLE or hypothyroidism remains unclear.\n\n【16】The surgical strategy against moyamoya syndrome complicated with systemic vasculopathy is still controversial, particularly for adult cases. Kaga et al. reported a case of adult moyamoya syndrome with reduced cerebrovascular reserve capacity, which was effectively treated by an indirect method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Moreover, Isono et al. reported 5 cases of moyamoya syndrome with reduced cerebrovascular reserve capacity, which were treated by indirect revascularization surgery; they concluded that indirect methods were effective only in cases with well-developed leptomeningeal anastomosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However, El Ramahi and Al Rayes reported a case of moyamoya syndrome complicated with SLE, which was treated by an indirect method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Consequently, their case was complicated by intracerebral hemorrhage after the operation, and no remarkable therapeutic effect was achieved. However, their case did not evaluate the preoperative cerebrovascular reserve capacity. Our present case indicated not only well-developed leptomeningeal anastomosis, but also decreased cerebrovascular reserve capacity of the ischemic area through preoperative examination. Therefore, careful consideration of the preoperative angiographical findings and cerebrovascular reserve capacity would be vital for determining the indication of indirect revascularization surgery for moyamoya syndrome complicated with systemic progressive vascular disease.\n\n【17】#### 4\\.

Tension pneumothorax is an uncommon presentation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) or COVID-19 pneumonia. We present a case of tension pneumothorax in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia and myocarditis. This was an unlikely diagnosis in a patient with no known underlying lung condition and no other precipitating factors such as barotrauma. In an acute deterioration of patients with SARS-CoV-2, it is important to always consider alternative diagnoses and repeat imaging.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. COVID-19 was reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 31<sup>st</sup> December 2019 and declared as a global pandemic on 11<sup>th</sup> March 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Presentations of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe illness or death. Multiple complications of COVID-19 including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, acute respiratory failure (ARF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, myocarditis, heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>, venous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>, secondary infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, pancreatic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and neurological complications such as seizures, meningitis, encephalitis, encephalopathy, ataxia, and neuralgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> have been reported in the literature thus far.\n\n【4】Pneumothorax is a common respiratory condition which is defined as the presence of air in the pleural cavity. Pneumothorax can be categorised by aetiology into spontaneous and traumatic, and spontaneous pneumothorax can be further characterised into primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients with no background of respiratory disease, and the pathophysiology is thought to be from asymptomatic blebs and bullae which disrupt due to shear force 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Secondary pneumothorax occurs in patients with underlying lung abnormality and diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, sarcoidosis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and connective tissue disorders. Many cases of traumatic pneumothorax are iatrogenic, and this complication has been reported in central vein cannulation, pleural tap or biopsy, transbronchial biopsy, fine needle aspiration, and acupuncture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Pulmonary barotrauma is another cause of iatrogenic pneumothorax occurring in patients being mechanically ventilated due to high inspiratory inflation pressures.\n\n【5】Tension pneumothorax develops when damaged tissue forms a one-way valve leading into the accumulation of air in the pleural space with inhalation. This results in rising volume of air and pressure in the affected hemithorax, leading to collapse of the affected lung and displacement of the mediastinum towards the contralateral side. This is a medical emergency, as the mediastinal shift exerts pressure on the contralateral lung and the vena cava, resulting in respiratory insufficiency, cardiovascular compromise, and death if untreated.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】We present the case of a 62-year-old gentleman, who was brought into the emergency department (ED) by ambulance with a history of dry cough, low grade fever, worsening shortness of breath for 4 days, and pleuritic sounding chest pain, which was different to when he had a pulmonary embolism approximately ten months ago. His past medical history included type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, treated malignant neoplasm of the base of tongue, diverticular disease, essential hypertension, and previous provoked pulmonary embolism. Before admission, he was living independently with his wife. His exercise tolerance was restricted to 10 yards with the assistance of a walking stick. He was an exsmoker and used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day but stopped smoking a few years previously.\n\n【8】On admission, he was pyrexial with a temperature of 38.2°C, oxygen saturations 98% on 28% FiO<sub>2</sub>, blood pressure 73/35 mmHg, and pulse rate 92 bpm. Initial treatment included oxygen 28% FiO<sub>2</sub> via a venturi mask and fluid resuscitation for hypotension. Physical examination revealed bibasal crepitations on auscultation of chest and a swollen and tender right leg. Initial investigations revealed deranged biochemical markers  and opacification affecting the right midzone of the lung .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Blood results.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest radiograph on admission demonstrating right midzone consolidation.</u>\n\n【11】Initial laboratory workup summarised in Table 1.\n\n【12】In view of the clinical presentation and raised d-dimer, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed which reported right upper lobe consolidation with subtle peripheral ground glass opacification in the left upper lobe and both lower lobes, suggestive of early COVID-19 infection . Moreover, his troponin I levels were markedly elevated and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment depression and T-wave inversion in the anterolateral chest leads. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function with an akinetic and rounded apical septal wall.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CT pulmonary angiogram report: there are no pulmonary emboli and pleural or pericardial effusions. There is consolidation within the right upper lobe with subtle peripheral ground glass opacification noted in the left upper lobe and in both lower lobes. Appearances are indeterminate but could represent early COVID-19 disease. The central and peripheral airways are patent with no lower cervical, axillary, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lung mass. Other viscera are unremarkable.</u>\n\n【14】On account of the history, examination, and investigations, he was treated as suspected COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia (CURB-65 score = 2, moderate severity), COVID-19 myocarditis, and sepsis, leading to multiorgan failure. In view of poor physiological reserve and comorbidities, the ceiling of care was decided to be ward level care and noninvasive ventilation if needed. However, he began to improve clinically, became normotensive, and was able to be weaned off oxygen day 3 after admission. By that time, his swab detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\n【15】Following initial improvement, he suddenly developed a new, increased oxygen demand, requiring titration of humidified oxygen up to 10 litres. Chest physiotherapy helped him bring up copious volumes of thick sputum, and he was stable for most of the day with oxygen saturations of 93%. Later that day, he suddenly deteriorated and becoming cyanotic and critically unwell. Oxygen saturations were 80% on 15 litres nonrebreathe mask, and he was significantly tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 40/minute. An urgent portable chest X-ray revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax causing mediastinal shift .\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Portable chest radiograph following acute deterioration, demonstrating a right-sided tension pneumothorax.</u>\n\n【17】An intercostal drain was inserted on an emergency basis and the patient improved slightly over the next 24 hours though he still required oxygen via a high flow nasal cannula system to maintain oxygen saturations of 92% or more. Despite the chest drain and the addition of thoracic suction, the lung did not reexpand. He continued to deteriorate rapidly, was unable to tolerate further pleural procedures, and died.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Here, we present a case of spontaneous tension pneumothorax in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia and myocarditis. Although our patient did not have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease before the admission, review of his CTPA images revealed minimal emphysematous changes in the right lung which could have ruptured by the added insult of COVID-19 pneumonia. This could have led to an air leak into the hemithorax, resulting in a spontaneous tension pneumothorax.\n\n【20】COVID-19 is a newly described disease with limited and ever-expanding knowledge of its clinical manifestations. Multiple causes of acute clinical deterioration have been already described, including ARDS and pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This case report aims to highlight the importance of urgent chest X-ray and prompt clinical examination in patients with COVID-19 that develop a sudden increase in oxygen requirements and become acutely tachypnoeic in order to rule out the possibility of pneumothorax. In view of the lack of a formal diagnosis of previous lung disease, this situation could have been misinterpreted as progression of ARDS in the current climate. This could have resulted in further deterioration of the patient if CPAP had been introduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Furthermore, chest physiotherapy is contraindicated in untreated tension pneumothorax, and depending on the time frame of pneumothorax development, may have had a negative effect on the clinical course of this patient.\n\n【21】Two recent case reports have been published regarding the link between COVID-19 and spontaneous pneumothorax; however, the absence of published literature of such cases could result in clinicians missing these diagnoses; hence, we present this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】In summary, our case demonstrates spontaneous tension pneumothorax as a rare but serious complication of COVID-19.

Full functional recovery can take months to years, but recurrence and/or persistence of symptoms and disability are frequent. This case reports a 22-year-old male who recovered from NA within 3 months following treatment with 1000 mg of methylprednisolone and off-label use of 0.5 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for four consecutive days. Three years later, the patient experienced soreness and paresthesia of the shoulder following a military shooting exercise, and 0.75 g/kg of IVIG and 1000 mg of MP were prescribed for 2 consecutive days resulting in complete recovery and no recurrences to date. EMG findings, 3.5-year postinitial treatment, revealed improvement in the brachial plexopathy.

Similarly, the Dutch military suspects their current NA incidence rates, 18 cases per 100,000/year to be an underestimation due to lack of training and recognition of this disease by military personnel and physicians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Despite increasing recognition and diagnosis of NA, recovery times are extensive and prognosis remains poor, highlighting the need to report alternative treatments with improved outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Since there is no specific treatment for NA, traditional management involves an expectant, or “wait and see” approach, while more recent studies suggest a high-dose oral corticosteroid early in the disease process and a long-acting opioid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if pain is present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–5, 8, 9\\]</u>. However, with these therapies, many patients remain in pain or have sustained loss of function; less than 10% of patients, in a 246-person cohort, reported a full recovery from NA after 3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Recovery time is also extensive, lasting between 6 and 18 months with recurrence rates at 25% and 75% for idiopathic and hereditary NA, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10\\]</u>. This highlights the need for more effective therapies to attenuate NA symptoms and promote functional recovery. In the following case report, a suspected immune-mediated pathogenesis of NA prompted treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), (Gamunex-C<sup>®</sup>, Research Triangle Park, NC) for its potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, and methylprednisolone acetate (MP) (Depo-Medrol<sup>®</sup>, Kalamazoo, MI). Administering this therapy during the NA acute phase elicited a full functional recovery within 3 months for this patient.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】An otherwise healthy, 22-year-old male Marine presented to the Neurology Department with painless, progressive paresthesia and paresis to his right dominant limb that started 14 days prior. During that time, he was participating in an 8-day training exercise where he hiked nearly 113 km carrying a total load of 54–60 kg. His family history was unremarkable, but his medical history was notable for right acromial numbness and paresthesia without paresis lasting three months with no medical intervention, following a 19 km run with a 20 kg rucksack, eight months prior.\n\n【7】Sixteen hours into his 8-day training exercise, he began experiencing painless, right arm weakness with no improvement when the pack was removed. By day 5, his shoulder and upper arm were paretic. He retained his forearm range of motion, but with notable weakness. On day 7, he was unable to perform fine motor tasks, and by day 9, he had approximately 4 kg of right-hand grip strength.\n\n【8】Initial physical examination revealed no aphasia or dysarthria, facial droop, or apparent higher cortical function deficits. His extraocular muscles were intact, as well as the range of motion of his cervical spine. All physical exam findings of the extremities were compared bilaterally with pertinent exam findings only noted on the patient’s right upper extremity. All other extremities had normal findings.\n\n【9】He had mild winging of the right scapula, some atrophy of the right shoulder girdle, and deltoid but could shrug his shoulder. Right rhomboids and serratus anterior were intact. A few deltoid and triceps fasciculations were observed. Using Medical Research Council (MRC) criteria, motor scores on the patient’s right side were as follows: deltoid 4, supraspinatus 3, pectoralis 4, biceps 4, brachioradialis 4, triceps 3, wrist extensors 2, finger extensors 2, pronator teres 4, finger flexors 4, intrinsic hand movement 4, flexor carpi ulnaris 3-4, and all contralateral muscles of the left upper extremity were 5 . His right upper extremity was areflexic, and his left was 2+. Bilaterally, his patellar reflexes were 2+, ankle jerks were 2+, and toes were downgoing. The patient had lack of sensation to light touch and pinprick from the dorsum of his right shoulder and triceps, distally. Position sense was intact. He had no Romberg’s sign, and his gait and station were normal.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of Medical Research Council (MRC) scores of right limb before and after IVIG treatment.</u>\n\n【11】Chest MRI without contrast showed asymmetry of the nerve roots on the right side. Additionally, there was a subtle increase in T2 signal intensity and enlargement in the roots of C7, C8, and T1 in coronal and sagittal exams . This enlargement extended into the middle, and inferior trunks. Compared to the contralateral side, the right brachial plexus divisions were enlarged with an increased T2 signal intensity.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest MRI of the patient with inflammatory brachial plexopathy. (a) Coronal chest and (b) sagittal chest, T2 weighted and fat-suppressed MRI images without contrast show elevated T2 signaling indicating subtle thickening in the right brachial plexus structure at the time of diagnosis.</u>\n\n【13】An EMG was performed to further determine the extent of injury. Right brachial plexopathy involving primarily the posterior and lateral cords was confirmed by EMG. The deltoid, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, brachioradialis, and extensor digitorum communis in the right arm displayed acute, and to a lesser extent chronic, denervation changes. No electrophysiological evidence for nerve entrapment or radiculopathy was noted in the right upper extremity. These findings provided the basis for diagnosis of inflammatory brachial plexopathy.\n\n【14】The patient was treated for 4 consecutive days with 1000 mg of MP and 0.5 g/kg of IVIG. With this therapy, he experienced transient headaches, abdominal and facial edema, and diaphoresis. After the infusions were completed, he was given 80 mg of oral prednisone and instructions to taper the dosage by 20 mg every 3 days. The patient also received physical therapy for 4 months. Within 3 months, motor function and cutaneous sensations were fully recovered, and he was able to continue his military training.\n\n【15】Two years later, following a shooting exercise, the patient developed shoulder soreness and paresthesia in his right upper extremity. He was prescribed boosters of IVIG 0.75 g/kg and 1000 mg of MP for 2 consecutive days and the same course of oral prednisone. The paresthesia subsided upon completion of the treatment and has not recurred.\n\n【16】Upon posttreatment examination 3.5 years after the initial injury, consistent with initial findings, he had mild winging of the right scapula, and shoulder shrug, rhomboids, and serratus anterior remained intact. He had no Romberg’s sign, and his gait and station were normal. Compared to the initial examination, any atrophy, fasciculations, or deficits in sensation were no longer apparent. Motor scores of the right side were generally improved: deltoid 5, supraspinatus 5, pectoralis 4, biceps 5, brachioradialis 5, triceps 4, wrist extensors 4, finger extensors 4, pronator teres 5, finger flexors 5, intrinsic hand movement 5, and flexor carpi ulnaris 4, and the left upper extremity 5 . His right upper extremity reflex was 1+ (compared to previously being areflexic), and his left upper extremity reflex maintained at 2+. Bilaterally, his patellar reflexes 2+, ankle jerks 2+, and toes were downgoing, indicating no changes from the initial exam.\n\n【17】A follow-up EMG performed 3.5 years postinitial injury showed chronic, but not acute, denervation in muscles innervated by the superior trunk of the right brachial plexus, indicating an improvement in the brachial plexopathy .\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Summary of EMG findings of right limb before and after IVIG treatment.</u>\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 Nerve conduction findings of right limb.</u>\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】Neuralgic amyotrophy is a debilitating disease that can be initiated by genetics, biomechanical factors, immunological factors, or a combination of these factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 12\\]</u>. Septin-9 on chromosome 17q25, a protein responsible for cytoskeleton formation, cellular division, and tumorigenesis, is commonly mutated among those with hereditary NA, an autosomal dominant disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Hereditary NA and idiopathic NA are clinically similar, but hereditary NA tends to have more recurrent attacks, extrabrachial attacks, and increased duration of pain and disability due to repeated attacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Biomechanical and immunological events that may trigger NA include viral and bacterial infections, surgery, vaccinations, childbirth, strenuous exercise, injury, medical procedures, or autoimmune or connective tissue medical conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9,13\\]</u>. This case report describes a US Marine that developed rucksack palsy, which served as a traumatic trigger in his development of NA. Despite his poor prognosis, he achieved a complete functional recovery following treatment with IVIG and MP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10\\]</u>. Evidence of acute inflammation and axonal loss on his MRI and EMG made him a prospective candidate for this therapy, as there is evidence to support NA as an organ-specific immune-mediated disorder, rather than a generalized autoimmune disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Immune changes seen in patients with NA include blastogenic activity of lymphocytes within the brachial plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 14, 15\\]</u>, presence of antiganglioside antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 16\\]</u>, increased serum antiperipheral nerve myelin antibodies, and soluble terminal complement activation products during the acute phase of NA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Based on these data of prior NA patients, there are several, theorized mechanisms of action of how IVIG may have contributed to the healing process and full functional recovery in this patient. IVIG has regulatory effects on the complement system such as inhibiting active complement components from binding to and initiating destructive inflammatory responses against tissues; IVIG can also neutralize the anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, thereby reducing inflammation in NA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>. IVIG may also accelerate the clearing of pathogenic IgG seen in NA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Other NA case studies treated with IVIG and MP have demonstrated improved outcomes, often with shortened recovery times, compared to expectantor MP management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 16, 21–25\\]</u>. However, it has not been shown to improve the prognosis for every patient. This necessitates further research to better understand the mechanisms of NA and diagnostic indicators warranting this treatment regimen.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】This case report demonstrates the complete functional recovery of a patient suffering from NA following treatment with IVIG and MP within 3 months. These results are noteworthy as full functional recovery is rarely obtained with current recommended therapies, and partial functional recovery may take 6–18 months. The detection of antiganglioside antibodies and other inflammatory mediators prompted clinicians to consider IVIG and MP for the treatment of NA in this case. The efficacy and best time to administer this therapy has yet to be determined, but there are several cases that support the idea that IVIG and MP alleviate the symptoms and often improve the prognosis of NA. Although further research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis of NA and the therapeutic mechanism, efficacy, and potential adverse effects of IVIG in the treatment of NA, these results support a promising additional indication and usage for IVIG.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:09:07", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:09:21", "cost": 14.7}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:09:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:09:06"}

Subsequently, she received high-dose chemotherapy with an in vivo rituximab-purged autologous stem cell transplant. Seven years have passed since the transplantation, and she remains in remission. This suggests that transplantation of an in vivo rituximab-purged autograft is a promising strategy for primary bone marrow DLBCL.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The involvement of bone marrow in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) usually represents the systemic dissemination of lymphoma. However, a rare type of DLBCL involving the bone marrow alone, known as primary bone marrow DLBCL, has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. The prognosis of primary bone marrow DLBCL is poor with a median survival of 14.9 months, and approximately 70% of patients die within 2 years despite receiving chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue is an effective treatment strategy for high-risk non-Hodgkin lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Furthermore, treatment with rituximab in addition to stem cell mobilization or a conditioning regimen has been reported to improve the outcome in patients with high-risk B-cell lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. High-dose chemotherapy rescued by in vivo rituximab-purged autologous stem cells is a reasonable approach for primary bone marrow DLBCL because the risk of lymphoma cells being contaminated in the autograft is high. Here, we present a case of a patient with primary bone marrow DLBCL who achieved long-term remission (at least 7 years) after high-dose chemotherapy rescued by in vivo rituximab-purged autologous stem cells.\n\n【5】The present case suggests that this strategy may enable the cure of patients with primary bone marrow DLBCL.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 39-year-old woman suffering from dyspnea on exertion was admitted to our hospital. On physical examination, her body temperature was 37.0°C, the conjunctiva was anemic, but neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly was observed.\n\n【8】Laboratory findings showed a decreased white blood cell count of 2,950 × 10<sup>6</sup>/L, a low hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL, an increased soluble interleukin-2 receptor level of 3,350 U/mL, and a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase level of 154 U/L.

An通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18</sup></u>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan revealed disseminated bone marrow uptake, but no abnormal uptake was observed at other sites .

Our patient received an additional 2 courses of R-CHOP, followed by stem cell mobilization chemotherapy consisting of 24 mg/day dexamethasone (days 1 to 10), 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> carmustine (day 2), 75 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> etoposide (days 4 to 7), 200 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> cytarabine (days 4 to 7), 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> melphalan (day 3), and 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> rituximab (day 1), which was started 40 days after the completion of the last course of R-CHOP. Filgrastim at a dose of 600 μg was administered on day 11 and continued until the completion of leukapheresis. Leukapheresis was performed using a continuous-flow blood cell separator (Cobe Spectra, Lakewood, CO, USA), and a total of 7.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/kg body weight were obtained.\n\n【13】Two weeks after stem cell collection, our patient received a conditioning regimen of 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> carmustine (day −6), 100 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> etoposide (days −5 to −2), 200 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> cytarabine (days −5 to −2), 140 mg/m<sup>2</sup> melphalan (day −1), and 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> rituximab (day −9), followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). All of the collected stem cells were infused, and filgrastim was administered at a dose of 450 μg on days +1 to +10 and at 150 μg on days +11 to +13. Engraftment of neutrophils (ANC > 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>/L) was performed on day +11. Seven years have passed since the transplantation and the patient remains in remission .\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Primary bone marrow DLBCL is a rare but distinctive entity of extranodal lymphoma with a poor prognosis.\n\n【16】Because primary bone marrow DLBCL is rare, no standard therapy has been established. Chang et al. reported 8 cases of primary bone marrow DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Four patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, of which 3 died at 8, 10, and 22 months after the initial diagnosis. In contrast, of the 4 patients treated with chemotherapy combined with rituximab (R-CHOP, 3 patients; R-COP, 1 patient), 3 have remained in remission for 3, 10, and 14 months. These results suggest that similar to other types of DLBCL, chemotherapy combined with rituximab would be a standard strategy for primary bone marrow DLBCL too. However, the long-term outcome is unknown because the followup period is too short.\n\n【17】Although high-dose chemotherapy rescued by autograft is known to improve the outcome of relapsed lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, the role of upfront ASCT for the patients with DLBCL is controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Presently upfront ASCT is recommended only in selected high-risk circumstances or in the context of clinical trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Although primary bone marrow DLBCL is thought to be a type of high-risk lymphoma, the role of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is unclear because of its extremely rare incidence. To date, 3 cases of primary bone marrow DLBCL (including the present one) treated by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been reported, all of which have remained in remission for 14 months, 12 months, and 7 years (our patient) after transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】In patients with primary bone marrow DLBCL, the high risk of lymphoma cells in the autograft being contaminated is a major problem because it may cause relapse. Therefore, an in vivo rituximab-purged autograft was used for transplantation in our patient. She has been alive without evidence of relapse for the past 7 years. This suggests that ASCT using an in vivo rituximab-purged autograft might be a promising strategy for the treatment of primary bone marrow DLBCL.\n\n【19】However, because this is only a case report, the role of ASCT in curing primary bone marrow DLBCL remains unclear. An accumulation of cases is required to clarify the role of ASCT with an in vivo rituximab-purged autograft for primary bone marrow DLBCL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:12:05", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:25:20", "cost": 794.716}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:25:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:12:05"}

Few case reports have been reported of ITP after COVID-19 infections and COVID-19 vaccines. Herein, we present a patient who presented with severe ITP with a platelet count of 0 after receiving the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (also known as the Pfizer BioNTech). She subsequently recovered with a prolonged treatment course.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a clinical condition where the platelet count is less than 100,000/μL and is associated with petechiae, bruising, or mucosal bleeding when the platelet count is below 50,000/μL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. ITP may be primary when autoantibodies to platelets cause platelet destruction without an underlying cause, but it is secondary when it is the result of an associated condition that may include medications, infections, malignancies, or autoimmune conditions. Prior reports have indicated that vaccinations such as MMR have resulted in ITP in children and that viral infections such as hepatitis C, HIV, and EBV infection can be associated with ITP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. In this report, we present a patient who presented with severe ITP after receiving the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (also known as the Pfizer BioNTech) and recovered with treatment.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Vignette\n\n【5】A 63-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a rash and easy bruising that started a day after her second dose of BNT162b2 vaccination. The rash was initially noted on both her legs and then spread to the rest of her body. Two days after the second COVID-19 vaccination, the patient noticed a large bruise on her lower back, without prior trauma. In addition, she also noted mild bruising of her tongue but no active bleeding. She reported mild dyspnea after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine 3 weeks earlier and noted similar symptoms soon after her second dose of the vaccine. Dyspnea was not associated with chest pain or leg edema. The patient denied nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, hematemesis, hematochezia, or any abdominal pain. She had a past medical history of COPD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, but no history of liver disease or bleeding tendencies. She was on hypoglycemic agents, antihypertensives, and citalopram, but not on aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed generalized petechiae and subcutaneous bruises on the lower back. Laboratory evaluation showed normocytic anemia, normal white blood cell count, and platelet count was 0/μL. Peripheral blood smear was normal except for decreased platelets without evidence of immature platelets. Figure 1 demonstrates the timeline of the patient’s treatments and her platelet counts.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The timeline of the patient’s treatments and her platelet counts.</u>\n\n【8】Since thrombocytopenia due to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) can occasionally lead to thromboembolism and, given the patient’s initial complaint of dyspnea, with an elevated D-dimer of 0.85, a CT angiogram was ordered. CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism. Subsequent workup including absence of schistocytes on peripheral smear, normal LDH, haptoglobin, and bilirubin levels ruled out MAHA. CT head showed no intracranial bleeding. Table 1 shows the pertinent lab values at admission and after treatment.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory values on admission.</u>\n\n【10】Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), believed to be secondary to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was admitted to the hospital. The patient was started on dexamethasone at 40 mg orally daily for 5 days, as well as IVIG 1 g/kg once daily for a total of two doses. Of note, the patient tested positive for Sjogren’s Ab (SS-A) and scleroderma antibodies. Workup for other causes of thrombocytopenia including hepatitis serology, HIV, EBV, ANA, Smith Ab, RNP ab, anti-Jo1 Ab, anti-dsDNA Ab, anti-centromere, and Sjogren’s ab (SS-B) were negative.\n\n【11】Over the next week, the patient’s vitals and overall health remained stable. Her bruising was gradually improving, with no evidence of bleeding or new bruising. While the clinical picture showed stability, her platelet count showed a very slow response to treatment. Labs showed slowly increasing platelet counts from 0K/μL on day 1, 1K/μL on day 3, 5K/μL on day 5, 15K/μL on day 6, 11K/μL on day 7, and 8K/μL on day 8. Since the thrombocytopenia was refractory to IVIG and a 5-day course of steroids, the patient was started on prednisone therapy daily for a total 9 of doses. She subsequently received two doses of Nplate and one dose of Rituxan. Her platelet count responded and improved to 99K/μL on day 14. She was discharged on a prednisone taper and is scheduled to receive the remaining three doses of Rituxan in the outpatient setting.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】The diagnosis of ITP is generally made after the exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia as well as response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As in our patient with new onset ITP, the temporal association of the onset of symptoms after the BNT162b2 vaccine is significant but cannot be proved causality. An underlying rheumatological process cannot be entirely ruled out, given patient’s mildly positive ANA and positive scleroderma antibodies. A detailed review of the current literature shows that patients have been diagnosed with ITP after COVID-19 vaccination, including some patients with a prior history of ITP and few without prior ITP, as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–14\\]</u>. However, most of the reports have shown ITP occurring after the first dose of vaccine, with few reports after the second dose, as seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7, 9–14\\]</u>. It is also possible that the patient may have had a mild form of ITP after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine but was not symptomatic or not detected at that time.\n\n【14】As most patients with ITP respond well to IVIG and steroids, this is the initial management approach for patients with ITP after the COVID-19 vaccine. If the platelet count remains low, thrombopoietic agents and vincristine may be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Rituximab is generally avoided following COVID-19 vaccination due to the slow onset of action, potential negation of recent vaccine-induced immunity, and the inability to revaccinate for more than 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, it may be administered in refractory cases when the benefits outweigh the risks of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The pathogenesis of ITP is still unclear, but it is believed to be secondary to autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoprotein by the patient’s B cells, or by cytotoxic T cells against platelet precursors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As noted earlier, secondary ITP has been reported following multiple conditions, including vaccinations. Based on a literature review, it may be possible that antibodies directed against an antigen formed by the attachment of vaccine particles to some platelets lead to a reaction involving the rest of the platelets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. There have also been reports of ITP following a COVID-19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 17\\]</u>. Interestingly, all the patients presented with symptoms of subcutaneous or mucosal bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia. In general, platelet counts improve rapidly with steroids, but this was not seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. One speculation regarding the etiology is that an underlying damage to megakaryocytes may have resulted in a lack of platelet production. This could also possibly explain the lack of response to IVIG due to the absence of autoantibodies to platelets. The subsequent improvement after day 14, which included treatment with Nplate, could then have been secondary to the development of a new population of megakaryocytes to reestablish platelet production.\n\n【16】ITP is commonly treated with steroid therapy and IVIG, as in our patient. It is important to highlight that the platelet count responds to therapy with improvement of counts. In some instances, when there are bleeding complications, platelet transfusion may be needed.\n\n【17】In summary, we herein report a unique case of severe ITP likely induced by the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, reiterating that this is a rare and treatable condition that can be diagnosed easily and responds to therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:34:44", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:34:56", "cost": 11.407}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:34:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:34:44"}

In the COVID-19 era, reports of AIFR have emerged, with high mortality and morbidity rate. This paper presents two cases of COVID-19 associated AIFR with the combined proven fungal etiology of Aspergillus flavus and Rhizopus arrhizus in case 1 and Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus in case 2. Both patients received liposomal amphotericin B then posaconazole combined with aggressive surgical debridement of necrotic tissues with a favorable clinical outcome. Mixed etiology AIFR can influence the outcome; hence, further studies are required upon this new threat.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has increased and become one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. Most of these infections are described in patients with diabetes mellitus, hematologic malignancies, and solid organ transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Bacterial coinfection in SARS-CoV-2, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenza, and fungal coinfection, including Aspergillus or Mucoraceae species have become a serious concern in the management of patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Both of these fungal infections have been well described as complications of COVID-19, especially among critically ill patients in intensive care units 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Herein, we report two cases of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFR) with combined Aspergillus and Mucoraceae species.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【6】The first case was a healthy 31-year-old woman with a five-day history of fever (38.5°C), myalgia, and severe dyspnea (SpO<sub>2</sub> was 85%–room air), who referred to the emergency department. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. High-resolution chest CTs obtained at admission showed multifocal areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacification with peripheral and basal predominance. Supportive oxygen therapy with nasal cannula and treatment with remdesivir at a dose of 200 mg on day one and 100 mg/d for five days with methylprednisolone 80 mg every 12 hours were prescribed. Methylprednisolone continued for two days and then switched to dexamethasone 4 mg/d, which continued for additional four days. The patient’s condition improved over ten days, and the patient was discharged with SpO<sub>2</sub> = 93%, afebrile, and improved cough. Several days after discharge, the patient referred to our hospital with a history of headache, left retro-orbital pain, and nasal discharge and was readmitted. At admission, physical examination showed a hemodynamically and respiratory stable patient. The initial laboratory data were as follows: white blood cells (WBC) 13000/μl, platelet (PLT) 240000/μl, hemoglobin (Hb) 10 gr/dl, creatinine (Cr) 0.7, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 26 mg/dl. On physical examination, the extraoral swelling over the left side of the face and the numbness of the left side of the upper lip was remarkable. Subsequently, the computed tomography of sinuses and lungs was performed . According to the mucosal thickening and accumulation of secretions in paranasal sinuses, the patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery and severe involvement with the necrosis of the left-side lateral nasal wall and left maxillary sinuses were observed. The direct smear of the specimen revealed broad aseptated hyphae and septated hyphae. The sample was cultured with colonies phenotypically identified as Aspergillus flavus and Mucoraceae species. Sequencing of the ribosomal DNA was performed by amplification, and identification of Rhizopus arrhizus (formerly called Rhizopus oryzae) was confirmed . The patient received treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>). After 15 days of liposomal amphotericin B therapy and removal of necrotic tissues, the therapy switched to posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg every 6 hours). No evidence of recurrence was found at her one-month follow-up.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Ostiomeatal complex (OMC) is obstructed leading to mucosal thickening and accumulation of secretions in paranasal sinuses.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Direct smear revealed hyphae with characteristics consistent with Mucorales (a).

Case 2\n\n【11】The second case was a 58-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension who referred to the emergency department due to nasal obstruction with complaints of purulent discharge, left side facial pain with numbness, and swelling of the upper eyelid and the left cheek. The patient was hospitalized three weeks before the admission with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and was treated with remdesivir at a dose of 200 mg on day one followed by 100 mg/d and dexamethasone 8 mg/d for five days. The initial laboratory data were as follows: WBC 7300/μl, PLT 141000/μl, Hb 8.9 gr/dl, Cr 1.4, and CRP 31 mg/dl. SpO<sub>2</sub> was 92% at room. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent, and his blood sugar level and HbA1c were 210 mg/dl and 6%, respectively. Physical examination showed the ptosis of the left eye associated with periorbital edema and numbness of the left cheek. The findings of the sinuses CT scan were opacity in the left maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses . The endoscopy sinus surgery showed necrotic tissues in the left middle turbinate and left maxillary sinus associated with profuse purulent discharge. The histopathological examination of tissue sections revealed a vascular structure (large arrow) involved and filled with both thin and broad (smaller arrow) fungal hyphae . The sample was cultured with colonies phenotypically identified as Aspergillus fumigatus and Mucoraceae species. PCR amplification and sequencing was performed, and the Mucoraceae species was identified as Rhizopus arrhizus (formerly called Rhizopus oryzae) . The patient received treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>). After 17 days of liposomal amphotericin B therapy and removal of all necrotic tissues, the therapy switched to posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg every 6 hours). At the time of writing this paper, 14 days follow-up demonstrated no evidence of recurrence.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 CT scan of sinuses (axial and coronal) revealed nasal septum is deviated to the left side.

Discussion\n\n【17】AIFR is a time-sensitive condition that must be diagnosed and treated promptly to avoid serious complications. The most common etiologic agents of these invasive fungal infections include Mucoraceae species and Aspergillus species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Rhizopus oryzae and Aspergillus flavus are the most common organisms isolated from patients with AIFR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6,7\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Mucormycosis is an angioinvasive opportunistic infection caused by fungi belonging to the Mucorales order and the Mucoraceae family. This invasive fungal infection is recognized as one of the most rapidly progressive lethal forms of fungal infection with a high mortality of 70–100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8,9\\]</u>. Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis is the most commonly reported form of the disease characterized by progressive invasion of the hard palate, paranasal sinuses, orbit, and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This clinical manifestation of mucormycosis is observed mainly in patients with uncontrolled diabetes or having immunosuppressive conditions, such as corticosteroid treatment with immunosuppressive doses, cancer chemotherapy, hematological stem cell transplants, prolonged neutropenia, and solid organ transplants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Aspergillus species are ubiquitous molds found in diverse environments throughout the year. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common and life-threatening fungal pathogen, which is particularly important among immunocompromised hosts. Aspergillus flavus more commonly causes rhinosinusitis. Pulmonary aspergillosis and sinusitis are the most common sites of invasive aspergillosis most frequently observed in the setting of immunosuppression status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 12–14\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Cases of secondary fungal infections, such as aspergillosis and mucormycosis, have been reported since the emergence of COVID-19, demonstrating the importance of COVID-19-associated invasive fungal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Imaging modalities, including CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging, can help to suggest a diagnosis of AIFR, and biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Direct mycological and histological examinations are the gold standard for diagnosis. In mucormycosis and aspergillosis, the hyphae are specific for each fungus; Mucoraceae presents large, broad aseptated hyphae with right-angle branching, and Aspergillus shows septated hyphae that branch at 45° angles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Coinfection with mucormycosis and aspergillosis is a rare entity, and very few cases have been published in the literature. Johnson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> reported a case of combined probable pulmonary aspergillosis and possible mucormycosis in a diabetic male with COVID-19 in the ICU who was treated with liposomal amphotericin B. Zayet et al. reported a case of cerebro-rhino-orbital mucormycosis and aspergillosis coinfection in a patient with diabetes mellitus with complete recovery after antifungal therapy combined with surgical debridement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Anita et al. reported three cases of mucormycosis combined with aspergillosis caused by Rhizopus species and Aspergillus flavus with favorable clinical outcomes. The patients were treated with surgical debridement combined with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B, and two cases received step-down therapy with posaconazole. One of the cases was a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In another report, a 55-year-old diabetic male patient was hospitalized with a three-day history of dyspnea, fever, and generalized malaise. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed. He was started on methylprednisolone (40 mg twice daily), along with general supportive care and management of diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with ptosis and diplopia on day 10 of discharge and rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis caused by mixed proven infections of Rhizopus arrhizus and Aspergillus flavus were confirmed. The patient received amphotericin B and after 17 days of therapy, the patient recovered clinically. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was the main predisposing factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Several mechanisms in COVID-19 predispose the patients to fungal infections. Endothelial damage and immune dysfunction are known complications of COVID-19, which may provide an opportunity for Aspergillus and Mucoraceae species to invade tissues. A decline in cell-mediated immunity has been observed, including leukopenia, lymphopenia, and T-cell dysregulation. COVID-19 associated lymphopenia is attributed to the production of cytokines and a decrease in CD4+T and CD8+T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 23\\]</u>. In addition, the usage of corticosteroids (CSs) in the treatment of COVID-19 may further predispose the patients to these fungal infections, which are attributed to CS-induced hyperglycemia or immunosuppression status caused by high doses of CS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24,25\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Our data indicate that both patients we presented had AIFR caused by proven aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Patient 1 had no other underlying comorbidity, and COVID-19 infection per se was the main risk factor for predisposing the patient to both infections. However, the CS therapy could possibly play a role in this process. In case 2, the combined risk factors, including COVID-19 infection, diabetes mellitus, CS treatment, and its induced hyperglycemia, contributed to invasive fungal infections.\n\n【25】Timely diagnosis of AIFR is critical to enable early initiation of active antifungal therapy. Complete surgical debridement of necrotic tissues, and when feasible, control of the underlying medical condition are the cornerstones of the therapy. Additionally, empiric antifungal therapy should be based on polyene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【26】This paper presents two cases of COVID-19 associated AIFR with mixed fungal etiology of Aspergillus flavus and Rhizopus arrhizus in case 1 and Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus in case 2. These two case reports highlight that combined aspergillosis and mucormycosis can present as complications of COVID-19. Mixed etiology AIFR can also influence the outcome; therefore, further studies are required upon this challenging threat.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:55:38", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:56:09", "cost": 31.272}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:56:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:55:37"}

However, an increased risk of breast cancer in NF1 patients has not been widely recognized or accepted. Here, we report two cases of breast cancer in NF1 patients and review the literature on the association between NF1 and breast cancer.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or von Recklinghausen disease is one of the most common autosomal dominant diseases in humans, and its incidence and prevalence have been reported to be approximately 1 in 2,700 and 1 in 4,600, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. NF1 is a group of heterogeneous multisystem neurocutaneous disorders and is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which is considered a classical tumor suppressor. Besides the development of neurofibromas, which are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors, NF1 patients have an increased risk of developing other benign and malignant neoplasms. Breast cancer has been shown to be associated with NF1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>; however, an increased risk of breast cancer in NF1 patients has not been widely recognized or accepted.\n\n【4】Here, we report two cases of breast cancer in NF1 patients and review the literature on the association between NF1 and breast cancer.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case One\n\n【7】A 25-year-old woman with a palpable lump in her right breast was referred to our department. She had been diagnosed with NF1 at the age of 17 years. Two of her aunts had cancer; one had breast cancer and the other had ovarian cancer. However, there was no family history of neurofibromatosis.\n\n【8】On US, an ill-defined hypoechoic mass with microcalcifications and irregular duct changes, extending to the subareolar area, was noted in her right breast. Additionally, several lesions believed to be metastatic lymph nodes were observed in the ipsilateral axilla . On mammography (MMG), fine pleomorphic microcalcifications with segmental distribution were noted in the lower outer portion of her right breast . On MRI, the lesion showed about 6.5 cm sized, nonmass enhancement lesion with heterogeneous internal enhancement pattern and occupied most of the right breast, except the lower inner portion .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Ultrasonography shows an ill-defined hypoechoic mass with microcalcifications and irregular duct changes in the right breast.

Mammography shows fine pleomorphic microcalcifications with segmental distribution in the lower outer portion of the right breast. And mild skin thickening (arrows in c) and metastatic lymph node are also noted (c). Magnetic resonance imaging shows that lesion exhibits nonmass enhancement lesion with heterogeneous internal enhancement pattern and occupies most of the right breast, except the lower inner portion (d).</u>\n\n【10】She underwent US-guided core needle biopsy in the lower outer portion of her right breast and of the pathological lymph nodes in the right axilla. She was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ in the breast and metastatic lymphadenopathy in the right axilla. She underwent modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, and the final diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma with axillary metastasis (T2N3M0; estrogen receptor positive; progesterone receptor positive; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative; Ki-67 10–20%). We analyzed DNA from peripheral blood in order to evaluate the presence of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Specific coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequence alterations were confirmed at the genomic level with PCR amplification, and no mutation was noted in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. She received postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Presently, she is being regularly followed up, and she has not shown any signs of disease recurrence.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Case Two\n\n【12】A 47-year-old woman with NF1 visited our department for a palpable lump in her left breast. On MMG, an irregular hyperdense mass with microlobulated margin was noted in her left breast, and pathologic lymph nodes were noted in her left axilla . On US, the large mass appeared to be of irregular shape, angular margin, and hypoechoic echotexture and multiple pathological lymph nodes were noted in the left axilla at levels I and II .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Left mediolateral oblique mammography shows an irregular hyperdense mass with indistinct margin (thin arrow) and axillary lymphadenopathy (arrowhead).

PET-CT shows hepatic metastasis (d).</u>\n\n【14】She underwent US-guided core needle biopsy of the irregular mass in the left breast and was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Additionally, during the staging workup, she was diagnosed with hepatic metastasis on PET-CT . She received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and later underwent modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. The final diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma with axillary lymph node metastasis (T3N1M1; estrogen receptor negative; progesterone receptor negative; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative; Ki-67 10–20%). During follow-up, the hepatic metastasis worsened and lung, bone, and retroperitoneal lymph node metastases were diagnosed. She eventually died 15 months after being diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Here, we reported two cases of NF1 associated with breast cancer. NF1 is a complex neuroectodermal disorder characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, high penetrance, and wide variability in expression. The disease is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, and the risk of various types of tumors, especially those derived from the embryonic neural crest, including pheochromocytoma, leukemia, glioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, astrocytoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, is higher in individuals with NF1 mutations than in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The NF1 gene is located in the pericentromeric region of the long arm of chromosome 17, which interestingly also includes the BRCA1 gene. An interaction between these two genes has been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>; however, the exact interaction is unclear.\n\n【18】Neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene, functions as a negative regulator of the Ras oncogene pathway, interacting with Ras and converting active Ras-GTP to its inactive form Ras-GDP. Ras is an essential component of the signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and the impairment of the hydrolytic reaction is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Hence, the NF1 gene has a potential role as a tumor suppressor gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 39\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The first report of an association between NF1 and breast cancer was published in 1972 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and subsequently several clinical cases of NF1 patients with breast cancer have been reported in the literature. We reviewed the English literature and have summarized all the reports of breast cancer in NF1 patients in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–38\\]</u>. There were 29 cases of breast cancer in NF1 patients and six studies about the association between breast cancer and NF1. Among 20 patients whose age at diagnosis was reported, eight patients (40%) were diagnosed with breast cancer before 40 years of age and five patients (25%) were diagnosed before 30 years of age. Additionally, among 19 patients whose breast cancer stage was reported, 10 patients (52.6%) had advanced cancer (greater than stage IIB). In the six studies, the incidence of breast cancer was reported to be 1.1–19.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of previously reported NF1 patients with breast cancer.</u>\n\n【21】Sharif et al. retrospectively evaluated the risk of developing breast cancer among 304 women aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with NF1 over a period of 30 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These authors found that the overall standardized incidence ratio of breast cancer was 3.5 in women with NF1 and that the risk of developing breast cancer at the age of 50 years was 4.9-fold higher in women with NF1 than in women in the general population. Additionally, the cumulative risk of developing breast cancer at the age of 50 years was 2% in women in the general population and was 8.4% in women with NF1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Similarly, Madanikia et al. retrospectively evaluated the risk of developing breast cancer among 126 women aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with NF1 over a period of 15 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. These authors found that the overall incidence of breast cancer in women with NF1 was 3.2%. Additionally, the risk of breast cancer was nearly threefold higher in women with NF1 who were under 50 years old than in women in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Nakamura et al. noted that breast cancer occurred in 18.5% of young women (<35 years of age) with NF1, which is a relatively high incidence when compared to the incidence of 6.7% in young women (<35 years of age) without NF1 reported in another study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Both of our patients developed breast cancer under 50 years of age, and one of these patients developed breast cancer at 25 years of age. A previous article reported the development of breast cancer in a 21-year-old woman with NF1 and BRCA1 mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. However, our patients did not have BRCA gene mutations.\n\n【22】Murayama et al. reported 37 cases of breast cancer associated with NF1, and most of the cases were diagnosed at an advanced stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In both of our patients, breast cancer was diagnosed at an advanced stage (stage IIIC in one case and stage IV in the other case). Furthermore, Evans et al. reported that women with NF1 have not only an increased risk of breast cancer but also an increased rate of mortality associated with breast cancer diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>.\n\n【23】All the above-mentioned articles have similar findings that NF1 increases the risk of developing breast cancer and that NF1 patients with breast cancer have a poor prognosis.\n\n【24】Breast cancer screening guidelines have been well established for the general population and for high-risk women, to decrease mortality through early diagnosis. However, currently, there are no such guidelines for NF1 patients, and guidelines similar to those for Cowden syndrome, which is a genetic disorder associated with breast cancer, should be developed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】The patients and physicians should be aware of the high possibility of breast cancer in individuals with NF1. For early diagnosis, the current guidelines used to screen women in the general population appear to be insufficient to screen NF1 patients. The findings of the above-mentioned reports and other published data justify the requirement of specific screening programs for NF1 patients, similar to the programs for Cowden syndrome patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between NF1 and breast cancer, especially at the genetic level, and to establish specific screening guidelines for the early diagnosis of breast cancer in NF1 patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:32:22", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:36:01", "cost": 218.439}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:35:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:32:19"}

In this report, we are presenting a case of rare variant of nutcracker phenomenon along with brief review of anatomy, pathophysiology, public health, and clinical significance of nutcracker syndrome. On a routine dissection of an adult male cadaver, we noticed an unusual arrangement of the structures at the hilum of the left kidney showing entrapment of renal vein between left anterior inferior and posterior segmental renal arteries. The variation in the course of left anterior inferior segmental renal artery leads to compression of left renal vein at renal hilum. Therefore, we have named this rare abnormal anatomical entity as hilar nutcracker phenomenon. The structures in the right renal hilum are normal. The objective of this paper is to report an unusual but important variant of nutcracker phenomenon and also give collective knowledge of such anatomical variations in renal vasculature that will help in diagnosing and treating such rare renal disorder.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The renal vein entrapment, also referred as nutcracker phenomenon is most commonly seen as a compression of renal vein in between abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery and the resulting clinical scenario is known as nutcracker syndrome. The nutcracker phenomenon could be asymptomatic or could give rise to nutcracker syndrome with clinical manifestations such as proteinuria, hematuria, pain, or discomfort in flank/abdominal/lumbar region, congestion in pelvic region in female, and varicocele in male patients. This usual form of nutcracker phenomenon or syndrome has also been termed as anterior or classic nutcracker phenomenon or syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. The first description of this pathological disorder was given by the anatomist Grant in 1937, whereas the first presentation as a clinical case was reported by El Sadr and Mina in 1950 and then by Chait et al. in 1971, who described this anatomical pattern of the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery as two arms or handles of a “nutcracker” compressing renal vein in between 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5–8\\]</u>. However, it was de Schepper who termed this phenomenon the “nutcracker syndrome” in 1973 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Apart from the classic anterior nutcracker syndrome, there are other rare variants such as posterior or retroaortic nutcracker syndrome and combined nutcracker syndrome. The retroaortic or posterior nutcracker syndrome refers to the left renal vein compression in between the abdominal aorta and vertebral spine. The combination of anterior and posterior nutcracker syndrome with duplication of the left renal vein and compressing either the anterior branch between the abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery or posterior branch between the abdominal aorta and vertebral spine has been be presented as combined nutcracker syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Also, Basile et al. have presented a clinical case of left renal vein compression arising due to aberrant renal artery close to inferior vena cava leading to stenosis and renal hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Polguj et al. have also reported a lateral or anterolateral nutcracker phenomenon describing a left renal vein compression as it moves between the superior mesenteric artery and the right renal artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The symptoms of nutcracker syndrome can also occur due to renal vein undergoing compression from fibrolymphatic tissue, retroperitoneal tumor, para-aortic lymphadenopathy, pancreatic tumor, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and anatomical variation of testicular artery such as overarching leading to entrapment of renal vein. The nutcracker syndrome should not be confused with the Wilkie’s syndrome or superior mesenteric artery syndrome, which is referred as duodenum getting entrapped and compressed in between abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The clinical diagnosis of the nutcracker syndrome can be done by doppler ultrasound using contrast, computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography. However, the gold standard in the diagnostic investigation is evaluating renocaval pressure gradient by retrograde venography or phlebography. The assessment of pressure gradient in between renal veins can also be used to confirm the diagnosis of obstruction in renal vein and assess the severity of the obstruction as well as monitor therapeutic progress while clinically managing patients with nutcracker syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 10–12\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The patients diagnosed with nutcracker syndrome should be managed according to their age and clinical symptoms of the patient. Usually young patients with less than 18 years of age are more frequently treated conservatively, since majority of such patients will show complete remission in their clinical symptoms including hematuria. Nutcracker syndrome patients with mild hematuria or with spontaneous resolution of hematuria can be managed with conservative therapy. However, surgical intervention for correcting anatomical anomaly including procedure such as renal autotransplantation is indicated for patients with significant pain and severe, persistent life threatening hematuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8, 13, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Public Health/Epidemiological Data\n\n【8】The nutcracker syndrome is not a hereditary disorder, but reports have been presented showing sporadic cases in the siblings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 15\\]</u>. The incidence of anterior or classic nutcracker syndrome is higher than the retroaortic nutcracker syndrome. The incidence of retroaortic nutcracker syndrome varies from 0.8% to 7.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 16\\]</u>. The nutcracker syndrome, once considered to be a rare entity, has recently been shown to be diagnosed increasingly among patients with hematuria or proteinuria. However, the exact prevalence rate of nutcracker syndrome cannot be formulated due to variability in symptoms and lack of standardized criteria for diagnosing nutcracker syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. There is also insufficient epidemiological data showing prevalence and incidence rates among various demographic groups. Similarly, lack of advanced imaging techniques and diagnostic modalities in the less developed part of the world would make such disorders difficult to diagnose. And therefore, due to nonreporting of this disease condition, the prevalence and incidence rates of nutcracker syndrome are still very low in these populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【9】The nutcracker syndrome can be seen among all the age groups from pediatric to geriatric patients with increased prevalence rate among young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 14\\]</u>. Some reports have stated that rapid growth spurt with increase in body height and the maturation of the vertebral bodies during puberty could lead to decrease in angle formed by the superior mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta resulting in entrapment and compression of renal vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 14\\]</u>. According to some studies, there could be gender dimorphism in nutcracker syndrome, with slightly more predisposition towards female gender especially affecting middle aged women. However, one study showed that no such difference exists in prevalence rate between males and females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 14, 17\\]</u>. Also, individuals with low body mass index along with lordosis and decreased fat in retroperitoneal and mesenteric region have been shown to increase the risk factor in compressing renal vein leading to nutcracker syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 18\\]</u>. Similarly, reports have also suggested that, in pregnancy, compression of the large veins by gravid uterus could be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of the right-sided nutcracker syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Clinical Significance\n\n【11】The nutcracker phenomenon could be asymptomatic or could give rise to nutcracker syndrome with clinical symptoms such as proteinuria, hematuria, abdominal or flank or lumbar discomfort or pain, varicocele in the men, and pelvic congestion in the women that include vulvar and pelvic varices along with dyspareunia, dysuria, and dysmenorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 20\\]</u>. The hematuria that includes both gross and microscopic hematuria followed by pain in abdominal and flank regions is the most common symptom reported in the patients with nutcracker syndrome. Similarly, about 5.5% to 9.5% of men with nutcracker syndrome get affected by varicocele with predominance on left side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 21\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The nutcracker syndrome due to left renal vein compression results in medial or mesoaortic narrowing and lateral or hilar dilatation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The increased pressure in the left renal vein and the renal hilum dilatation lead to congestion of the left kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The compression of renal vein can also manifest as gonadal vein, renal pelvis, and ureter varicosities leading to flank or abdominal discomfort or pain, albuminuria, hematuria, abnormal menstruation in the women, and varicocele in the men. Less frequently, renal vein compression can also present with symptoms involving gastrointestinal system, chronic fatigue syndrome in children and adolescents, and orthostatic proteinuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The gonadal vein or ovarian vein pain syndrome, a form of pelvic congestion syndrome, can manifest as flank or abdominal pain that sometimes can also involve posteromedial part of the thigh and buttock region. The pain can also show exacerbation while sitting, standing, walking, or doing movement such as riding in a moving vehicle. The flank pain can also occur from ureteral colic due to passage of blood clots through the ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Routinely, patients with nutcracker syndrome can also present with varicose veins in their lower extremities due to renal vein compression causing renal to gonadal vein reflux 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 20\\]</u>. The compression of renal vein leads to increase in pressure within the renal circulation which in turn leads to formation of plexus of abnormal hypertensive venous collaterals at the renal pelvis causing gross or microscopic hematuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, such gross or microscopic hematuria in nutcracker syndrome seldom causes anemia in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Apart from its anatomical classification, the nutcracker syndrome can be clinically differentiated into two subtypes, such as typical with renal manifestation and atypical with urologic manifestation. The typical clinical nutcracker syndrome with renal manifestation includes gross or microscopic hematuria and orthostatic proteinuria with or without flank pain. And the atypical clinical nutcracker syndrome with urologic manifestation includes fatigue, flank/abdominal pain, orthostatic intolerance, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia in women, and varicocele in men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. It is also proposed that nutcracker syndrome can be differentiated clinically into three subtypes, such as idiopathic hematuria, orthostatic proteinuria showing protein levels in urine more than 400 mg/dL, and orthostatic intolerance that leads to serious morbidity and interference with daily activities causing disability in living normal life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Nutcracker syndrome patients with orthostatic disturbance can also manifest systemic clinical symptoms such as headache, abdominal pain, fainting, and tachycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although systemic hypertension is not considered in the clinical manifestation of the nutcracker syndrome, some reports have described the presence of renin dependent hypertension in the patients with nutcracker syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Similarly, nutcracker syndrome is also known to be associated with various other clinical disorders such as IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, idiopathic hypercalciuria, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and familiar Mediterranean fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 22\\]</u>. There are clinical reports of patients presenting with nutcracker syndrome combined with other syndromes such as median arcuate ligament syndrome and May-Thurner syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Thus, the knowledge of anatomical variations in renal vasculature such as nutcracker syndrome will be very useful in treating patients with rare renal disorders. It will also serve as a valuable tool for surgeons performing and managing complicated renal surgeries. In this paper, we are reporting a rare case of nutcracker phenomenon that showed left renal vein compression by getting entrapped between anterior inferior and posterior renal segmental arteries at the hilum of the left kidney.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Case Report\n\n【16】On a routine dissection of an adult male cadaver, we noticed a variant of nutcracker phenomenon due to an unusual arrangement of the structures at the hilar region of the left kidney leading to left renal vein compression by overlapping anterior inferior segmental branch of a left renal artery. The normal pattern of structures passing through the hilum from anterior to posterior is renal vein, and then renal artery followed by the pelvis of the ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. According to Terminologia Anatomica, the renal artery divides into five segmental arteries such as superior, anterior superior, anterior inferior, inferior, and posterior segmental arteries near the hilum to supply respective renal segments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. However, there can be considerable amount of variation from this usual pattern of arterial supply to the renal segments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In this reported cadaveric body, the left main renal artery after arising from the aorta runs posterior to the renal vein. In the prehilar region around 3 to 4 cm away from the hilum of left kidney, the left main renal artery divides into two segmental arteries, namely, anterior and posterior segmental arteries. The anterior segmental artery during its course gives an anterior superior segmental artery and then continues further as anterior inferior segmental artery. The anterior segmental renal artery, after arising from the main left renal artery posterior to left renal vein, overrides the left renal vein in a serpentine fashion to enter the hilum of the left kidney anterior to left renal vein as anterior inferior segmental artery. During this anatomical course of the left anterior inferior segmental renal artery, the left renal vein gets entrapped between two anterior inferior and posterior segmental renal arteries. This unusual serpentine course of the left anterior inferior segmental artery tends to compress the left renal vein demonstrating a nutcracker phenomenon at the hilum of the left kidney on its anterior view . And from the posterior view, the posterior segmental artery can be seen entering the hilum of left kidney . So, in this reported anatomical abnormality, the two arms of the “nutcracker” are represented by the left anterior inferior and posterior segmental renal arteries with renal vein getting entrapped and compressed in between.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Left renal hilum (anterior view). (A) Left renal vein, (B) left anterior inferior segmental renal artery, (C) left anterior superior segmental renal artery, and (D) left kidney.</u>\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Left renal hilum (posterior view). (A) Left posterior segmental renal artery, (B) left kidney.</u>\n\n【19】Thus, in this cadaveric case report, we have described a rare anatomical variant of a nutcracker phenomenon showing entrapment and compression of left renal vein between two renal segmental arteries at the hilum of left kidney. And, therefore, we have named this entity as hilar nutcracker phenomenon. The right renal hilum showed normal anatomical structures with renal vein, followed by renal artery and then pelvis of the ureter lying in anterior to posterior plane without any structural or course variations. The right and left kidneys were also visually normal looking with no apparent change in size and shape as well as no visible deformities in gross anatomical morphology . There were also no visible signs of varicocele or varicose veins on the lower extremities of the cadaver. Therefore, we felt that since there were no apparent signs of renal congestion in this cadaveric body, we should be addressing this particular anatomical anomaly showing compression of left renal vein between two segmental renal arteries as a nutcracker phenomenon rather than nutcracker syndrome in this cadaveric case report.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Right and left renal hila (anterior view). (A) Right kidney, (B) right renal vein, (C) inferior vena cava, (D) left renal vein, (E) left anterior inferior segmental renal artery, and (F) left kidney.</u>\n\n【21】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【22】The nutcracker phenomenon or nutcracker anatomy as an abnormal structural variation not always gives rise to clinical syndrome. And these anatomic abnormalities showing nutcracker phenomenon can be seen in normal individual with absolutely no clinical manifestations. Therefore, the patients with distinctive clinical symptoms along with noticeable anatomical variation displaying a nutcracker arrangement are the only patients diagnosed with nutcracker syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 25, 26\\]</u>. In this case report, we have presented an unusual case of nutcracker phenomenon which showed left renal vein getting entrapped between the anterior inferior and posterior segmental renal arteries. And along this course, the left anterior inferior segmental renal artery compresses the left renal vein due to its serpentine path at the hilum of left kidney. So, in order to distinguish such a rare variant of nutcracker phenomenon from usual anterior (classic) or posterior (retroaortic) nutcracker phenomenon, it should be called as hilar nutcracker phenomenon based on the anatomical location of the anomaly. Thus, reporting such a complex and rare anatomical variant of renal hilar vessels demonstrating nutcracker phenomenon is very significant from clinical perspective in terms of medical diagnosis and surgical approach.\n\n【23】The entrapment of renal vein in the two arms of the fork leads to nutcracker phenomenon. However, only few patients manifest the clinical sign and symptoms of renal vein compression. Therefore, the nutcracker syndrome and its related pathophysiology are difficult to understand or comprehend and so they remain elusive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 18\\]</u>. Out of several theories presented in the medical literature, one of the theories states that posterior nephroptosis or renal ptosis can result in venous hypertension due to left renal vein getting stretched over the aorta causing its compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 15, 27\\]</u>. It is also proposed that, in the nutcracker syndrome, the abnormal branching of the superior mesenteric artery may cause an elevation in the pressure gradients between the proximal segment of the left renal vein and inferior vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Furthermore, in normal physiological condition, the pressure difference of less than 1 mmHg exists between the left renal vein and the inferior vena cava and in the nutcracker syndrome this pressure difference is more than 3 mmHg. This increase in pressure difference between the left renal vein and inferior vena cava promotes venous congestion leading to abnormal development of collateral branches between the renal sinus and the renal calyces causing hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. One study also suggested that, in nutcracker syndrome patients, venous hypertension may cause hematuria due to disruption of the thin walled septum that separates the veins and the collecting ducts in the renal fornix. Also, the pooling of blood in the gonadal veins may lead to pelvic congestion in patients with nutcracker syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【24】In normal anatomical situation the superior mesenteric artery forms almost a 90° angle with the abdominal aorta and this structural organization protects the left renal vein from getting compressed by the superior mesenteric artery. However, in anterior nutcracker syndrome, the above angle is less than 90° and this reduction of angle or space between superior mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta may result in compression of left renal vein. The superior mesenteric artery then follows a very steep path downward resulting in entrapment of the left renal vein in between two handles of the nutcracker tool formed by abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery. Such abnormality in the anatomical arrangement often leads to the compression of the left renal vein between abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery. Thus, this above illustration gives a classical description of anterior nutcracker syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Moreover, in the sagittal plane, the angle between the abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery measured is normally greater than 45°. And in nutcracker anatomy this angle is less than 35°. It is also proposed that in nutcracker syndrome the caliber of the lumen of the left renal vein is reduced by more than 50% from its normal diameter of 4-5 mm, while it crosses abdominal aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【25】In conclusion, the nutcracker phenomenon or syndrome denotes an anatomical abnormality showing left renal vein getting trapped and compressed from surrounding structure. It results in renal hilum dilatation, increased left renal vein pressure, and congestion in the left kidney. The nutcracker phenomenon could be asymptomatic or could give rise to nutcracker syndrome with clinical manifestation such as hematuria, proteinuria, flank or abdominal discomfort or pain, varicocele in men, and pelvic congestion in women. In this report a rare case of hilar nutcracker phenomenon is presented. In hilar nutcracker phenomenon, the left renal vein is entrapped and compressed in between the anterior inferior and posterior segmental renal arteries at renal hilum. Also, the compression of left renal vein displaying a nutcracker phenomenon was due to unusual serpentine course of left anterior inferior segmental renal artery at the hilum of left kidney. Thus, the objective behind this report is to impart and share knowledge of anatomical variations in renal vasculature such as nutcracker phenomenon that not only will help in understanding pathophysiology behind renal disorders, but will also assist clinicians in diagnosing and treating such rare renal syndromes. Furthermore, highlighting such rare and critical anatomical variation in renal vasculature has academic as well as clinical significance due to increase in number of renal surgical, radiological, and transplant procedures being performed in recent years.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:07:28", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:07:42", "cost": 14.153}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:07:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:07:28"}

Clinical presentation includes fever, leucocystosis, and abdominal pain. CT SCAN is a must for diagnosis. The preferred treatment is either conservative, with intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous drainage, or splenectomy. We report the thirteen case of a splenic abscess after LSG. In our patient, the abscess occurred three weeks after LSG in a 21-year-old man, and it was successfully treated conservatively.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Morbid obesity is nowadays a common disease affecting large amount of adults worldwide. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a simple procedure to treat morbid obesity. However, complications occur and include hemorrhage, leak of luminal contents, obstruction, and infection (wound and intra-abdominal abscess). We report the case of a patient who underwent LSG, complicated three weeks after surgery by a splenic abscess. And to the best of our knowledge, there were only twelve cases reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 21-year-old obese male with a body mass index of 45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> underwent LSG in our department in April 2018. The patient did not have any past medical or surgical history. No systemic CT scan was done preoperatively, only gastroscopy that showed normal mucous of the stomach. The operation was very smooth without any complications: no splenic infarction nor a tear was detectable. No hemostatic agents were used. Immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 2 after tolerating a clear diet. No routine CT scan or opacification was made. Three weeks after surgery, the patient presented high fever and chills and took 24 hours of oral antibiotics before consulting his surgeon who decided to rehospitalize the patient.\n\n【6】At admission, his temperature was 38.5°C, and pulse rate was 120/min with a normal blood pressure. The blood results revealed 17,700 WBC and a CRP level at 295. Abdominal CT scan  showed a splenic abscess of 10 cm with no evidence of leakage. Initial management included hydration, intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam), and percutaneous drainage . The liquid culture was negative. The drain was removed after two days to avoid the risk of splenic hemorrhage without follow-up imaging.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Splenic abscess of 10 cm with no evidence of leakage.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Percutaneous drainage of the splenic abscess.</u>\n\n【9】The patient got better clinically and a full fluids diet was initiated, but he continued to experience low grade fever with a WBC count of 14,400 and CRP at 240. A new abdominal CT scan showed a residual splenic collection of 2 × 3 cm with a pleural effusion . The pleural effusion was drained, and it revealed a transudate liquid with negative culture. The splenic collection was considered as a residual abscess, and then we decided to upgrade antibiotherapy to a larger broad-spectrum one (imipenem) without radiologic or surgical drainage of the residual splenic abscess. A total of ten days with intravenous antibiotic treatment was necessary before fever disappearance. The patient was discharged under IM ertapenem for 10 days.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Pleural effusion and residual splenic abscess of 2 × 3 cm.</u>\n\n【11】Follow-up at 6 months, the patient was completely asymptomatic. Blood tests showed a normal count of WBC and CRP level.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】In general, splenic abscess can result from multiple causes such as neoplasia, immunodeficiency, trauma, splenic infarction, endocarditis, and sickle cell disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It was also reported after some gastric procedures like Nissen fundoplication and gastrectomy for cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Splenic abscess after LSG is a very rare condition, and the literature enumerates twelve patients who experienced this condition  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>. The mechanism of formation of splenic abscess described by the previous authors include iatrogenic splenic injury during surgery, splenic ischemia after LSG, extension from a gastric staple-line leak, and temporary immune suppression in the immediate postoperative course.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Characteristics of the different cases.</u>\n\n【16】In our case, there was no evidence of leakage nor a spleen ischemia or a spleen injury during the operation. Therefore, the formation of splenic abscess could be related to temporary immune suppression that results from rapid weight loss, limited oral intake, and a transient bacteraemia as it was noticed by Sakran et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In most of the cases, the patient presented with fever, leucocytosis, and left upper quadrant pain. Our patient experienced the same symptoms. The diagnosis was made on CT scan of the abdomen, as it remains the gold standard for diagnosis of splenic abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Splenic abscesses tend to be polymicrobial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>, so they should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. Enteric Gram negative and Gram positive were the common organisms as presented in Table 1. In our case, the culture was negative because the patient started on antibiotics without our knowledge before being admitted.\n\n【19】Solitary spleen abscesses are actually treated with percutaneous or laparoscopic drainage, in order to preserve the spleen. When symptoms persist or when multiple abscesses exist, splenectomy remains the definitive management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11, 12\\]</u>. However, our patient experienced a good evolution and a stable condition under conservative treatment, although a residual collection was documented on the last CT scan.\n\n【20】After all, would a splenectomy be beneficial even if the patient is completely asymptomatic, knowing that he is actually 6 months off treatment postoperatively?\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】Splenic abscess is a very rare complication after LSG. The etiology of formation of splenic abscess needs further studies. The patient must benefit from a conservative treatment based on antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. The decision to undergo a splenectomy will be based on clinical status and response to treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:40", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:53", "cost": 13.162}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:39"}

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative disorder presented with different manifestations. However, bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (BAH) and adrenal insufficiency (AI) are rare manifestations. Herein, we described a patient who suffered from BAH and AI in the context of PV. Case Presentation. A 60-year-old man with an underlying history of PV was admitted with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of consciousness. Primitive computed tomography (CT) scan findings revealed bilateral adrenal masses (right: 40  23 mm, left: 60  35 mm) with the second scan showing quite similar results (right adrenal: 40  29 mm, left adrenal: 48  26 mm) suggesting BAH. The further adrenal assessment proved concurrent AI. Both adrenal masses resolved completely after 15 months. However, the patient still suffered from AI. Conclusion. BAH and AI in patients with PV should be considered rare complications requiring high clinical suspicion for early diagnosis and treatment to avoid life-threatening outcomes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Several predisposing factors have been suggested for this unusual disease, including septic shock, stress, abdominal trauma, pregnancy, coagulopathies, and different hematologic disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome and essential thrombocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. However, the incidence of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (BAH) and subsequent adrenal insufficiency (AI) in the context of polycythemia vera (PV), as one of the myeloproliferative disorders, is rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Herein, we described a patient with an underlying history of PV who experienced BAH and subsequent AI and reviewed the literature in this regard.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 60-year-old man with underlying hypertension and PV was admitted after an acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and concomitant loss of consciousness. On admission, he had a blood pressure of 110/75 mmHg. The patient mentioned prior episodes of vague abdominal pain over the past decade. He was diagnosed with PV 14 years ago on the basis of erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, and a bone marrow biopsy which was consistent with erythroid and myeloid hyperplasia without any grades of fibrosis. A PCR test for BCR-ABL1 was negative and the mutation JAK2V617F was detected. He denied using cigarettes and alcohol. His only medications were daily aspirin (80 mg), hydroxyurea (200 mg), and irregular usage of losartan (25 mg) and he did not mention usage of any other drugs. He irregularly performed phlebotomies and did not have good adherence to treatment. Based on previous medical records, his underlying disease was not well controlled and his last cell blood count revealed white blood cells (WBC) of 19.2  10<sup>3</sup>/l, hemoglobin of 14.2 g/dL, and platelet counts of 160  10<sup>6</sup>/l. There were no records indicating a hypertension control status. He denied any previous thrombotic events or any major bleeding episodes. On physical examination, he was lethargic and confused. Abdominal tenderness was present in the epigastrium as well as the periumbilical region, and splenomegaly was also noted in addition to left side costovertebral angle tenderness. As shown in Table 1, laboratory data were normal except for leukocytosis, which had been approved to be in the same range since he was diagnosed with PV.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory results of the admitted patient.</u>\n\n【8】Abdominopelvic spiral computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous and oral contrast was requested and revealed splenomegaly and a hypodense lesion with a mean 55 Hounsfield unit (HU) at the site of the right adrenal gland (40  23 mm) and another ill-defined soft tissue lesion (60  35 mm) with infiltrative margins at the site of the left adrenal gland without any evidence of vascular thrombosis. Supportive therapy was initiated, but the patient left the hospital due to personal desire and was admitted to one of the tertiary hospitals in Isfahan, Iran.\n\n【9】His vital signs on admission were the followings: blood pressure: 115/85 mmHg, heart rates: 100/min, respiratory rates: 20/min, T: 37.1°C, O<sub>2</sub> saturation: 85% on room air (94% with a face mask). He suffered from dyspnea, chest pain, and diarrhea. On physical examination, huge splenomegaly, generalized abdominal tenderness, and left costovertebral angle tenderness were noted. The requested electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia. Laboratory profile showed elevated creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin .\n\n【10】With prior suspicion of prerenal azotemia due to intraabdominal disorders including mesenteric ischemia, fluid replacement and broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed. Due to the presence of multiple air-fluid levels on the abdominal X-ray, surgical consultation was requested, which recommended observation and correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances. After two days, the patient’s symptoms improved, and he gained normal bowel function with normal creatinine. Due to the suspicion of adrenal disorders including probable pheochromocytoma or adrenal cancer, an abdominal CT scan with the adrenal protocol was performed that revealed huge splenomegaly (spleen span: 25 cm) and bilateral adrenal masses (right adrenal gland: 40  29 mm, left adrenal gland: 48  26 mm) without any enhancement and 50 HU subsequently in favor of adrenal hematoma . Comprehensive adrenal glands assessment was performed and revealed the followings: aldosterone; 45 pg/ml (reference range: 30–400 pg/ml), plasma renin; 12 pg/ml (reference range: 12–36 pg/ml), 17 (OH) progesterone; 1.3 ng/ml (reference range: 0.2–2.3 ng/ml) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS); 25 mcg/dl (reference range: 56–80 mcg/dl). A 24-hour urine analysis was also requested, and the following were reported: norepinephrine; 23.1 mcg/day, epinephrine; 0.7 mcg/day, normetanephrine; 112 mcg/day, metanephrine; 62 mcg/day, and vanillylmandelic acid; 6 mg/day. These finding collections including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and abnormal adrenal CT findings were in respect to nonfunctional adrenal masses that resulted in AI in the context of adrenal hematoma. Therefore, basal cortisol was checked and the result was less than 3 mcg/dl. A tetracosactide test was performed in a way that one milligram of tetracosactide was injected intramuscularly and the cortisol level was measured at baseline and 4 hours afterwards (basal serum cortisol at 8 AM; 2.28 mcg/dl, 4 hours; 10.37 mcg/dl). Finally, the AI was confirmed and the patient was treated with daily prednisolone (5 mg) and fludrocortisone (100 microgram). The patient was discharged in a stable condition after 12 days with a recommendation for a follow-up ultrasound.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bilateral adrenal masses in favor of adrenal hematoma.</u>\n\n【12】During the follow-up assessment, the patient acknowledged voluntarily discontinuing medication for AI after ten months of discharge. However, he had no clinical symptoms of AI. The adrenal hematoma was resolved gradually through periodic ultrasound assessments, and there was no evidence of adrenal masses on the abdominal CT scan 15 months after his discharge . Basal serum cortisol was 5.90 mcg/dL, and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 68.2 pg/ml. Further investigation with the tetracosactide test 4 hours after intramuscular injection of 1 mg tetracosactide revealed a serum cortisol level of 18.15 mcg/dL. Therefore, AI was documented, and daily prednisolone (5 mg) was prescribed again.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Resolved bilateral adrenal hematoma during follow-up assessment.</u>\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion and Conclusions\n\n【15】We reported an Iranian male patient with an underlying condition of myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN), most likely a PV, which manifested with signs and symptoms of BAH and resultant AI. Although this entity is quite rare in literature, high clinical suspicion is required for prompt diagnosis and treatment. PV is defined as MPN with pathologic growth-factor independent increased growth of erythroid precursors. In addition, myeloid and megakaryocytic lineages are also often affected, resulting in increased numbers of WBCs and platelets. JAK2V617F is the main culprit in this regard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most common symptoms of PV are attributed to hyper-viscosity leading to oxygen delivery impairment and headache, vision changes, fatigue, claudication, dizziness, and aquagenic pruritus, among commonly reported complaints 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, few reports described MPN/PV patients with concomitant BAH and/or AI . Gonen et al. reported a 56-year-old male admitted with nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and loss of appetite. His lab data revealed erythrocytosis and leukocytosis with confirmed PV diagnosis through bone marrow biopsy. A CT scan revealed bilateral adrenal masses measured 4  5  5.5 cm and 4  3  2 cm in the right and left adrenal glands, respectively. Basal serum cortisol of <138 nmol/l, ACTH of 550 pmol/l, and an ACTH stimulation test suggested simultaneous AI. During the periodic follow-up assessment, both adrenal lesions diminished significantly, and they were completely disappeared after two years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Another report was of an 85-year-old man who suffered from PV presented with abdominal tenderness and syncope finally diagnosed as BAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Bhandari et al. described a 64-year-old man with a chronic history of PV admitted with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. Further assessments were in favor of cardiogenic shock resulting from myocardial infarction. After percutaneous coronary intervention and stent insertion in the left anterior descending artery, he was still hypotensive and low random cortisol (3.3 mcg/dl) with a dramatic response to hydrocortisone stress dose proved AI as the main culprit. Also, a noncontrast CT scan revealed BAH (right adrenal: 5.3  3.4  3.8 cm, left adrenal: 6.1  4.3  5.4 cm) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Summary of studies reported adrenal hemorrhage in the context of polycythemia vera.</u>\n\n【17】Despite the quite low prevalence of AH, improvement in imaging technologies including sonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scan might yield to diagnose this topic more frequently with the latter being the modality of choice in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Adrenal hematomas appear round or oval, and peri-adrenal fat stranding is almost present. Acute or subacute adrenal hematomas contain high attenuation areas that usually range from 50–90 HU. Most adrenal hematomas resolve gradually over time, but some of them may resolve partially and cause permanent AI and lifelong hormone replacement requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The exact pathophysiological mechanisms of AH remain uncertain; however, the anatomic location and physiological properties might play roles. Three main arteries (the superior, middle, and inferior suprarenal arteries) in comparison to a single adrenal vein draining blood from adrenal glands might predispose to vascular congestion and subsequent AH. On the other hand, catecholamine release leads to vasoconstriction of the adrenal veins impairing blood outflow. Efferent adrenal vein thrombosis and hyperviscosity resulting from PV impair venous drainage and venous congestion, ultimately predisposing to AH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In conclusion, BAH with subsequent AI should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with myeloproliferative diseases, especially PV, presented with non-specific symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hypotension, in order to prevent life-threatening outcomes.\n\n【20】#### Abbreviations\n\n| AH: | Adrenal hemorrhage |\n| --- | --- |\n| BAH: | Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage |\n| AI: | Adrenal insufficiency |\n| PV: | Polycythemia vera |\n| WBC: | White blood cell |\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| HU: | Hounsfield unit |\n| ECG: | Electrocardiogram |\n| LDH: | Lactate dehydrogenase |\n| DHEAS: | Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate |\n| ACTH: | Adrenocorticotropic hormone |\n| MPN: | Myeloproliferative neoplasia |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:39:09", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:39:20", "cost": 10.831}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:39:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:39:08"}

In the usual setting, patients with FAP are identified based on their germline mutations and the diagnosis of thyroid neoplasm is made after the FAP diagnosis. We herein report a case in which the recognition of a CMVPTC led to the initial diagnosis of FAP. The histological and clinical features of CMVPTC are reviewed with emphasis on its relationship to FAP.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Thyroid neoplasms occur in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with a frequency reported to be increased to as much as 100–160 times the rate seen in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, in a report of 28 tumors in 4 patients with FAP, were the first to recognize and describe in detail the unusual morphology of these tumors. They suggested that FAP-associated thyroid tumors have similarities to typical papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), but are sufficiently unique that they should be considered a tumor distinct from both follicular and papillary carcinoma. There are two reported cases in the literature of recognition of this unusual thyroid neoplasm leading to the diagnosis of familial polyposis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>; sporadic counterparts, non FAP associated, have been described as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. We herein describe a case of diagnosis of FAP in an individual without a family history of colonic disease based on recognition of a thyroid neoplasm of unusual morphology.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 23-year-old Chinese woman underwent total thyroidectomy for a painless enlargement of the thyroid gland. The enlargement had first been noted 10 years prior to admission, and there had been a gradual increase in size during the intervening period. The patient had no family history of colorectal cancer and both parents were in good health. She did not have any gastrointestinal symptoms and was otherwise well. A total thyroidectomy was performed for a clinical diagnosis of nodular goitre.\n\n【6】On the basis of the thyroid pathology, a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed. This revealed numerous small (<5 mm) polyps scattered in clusters from rectum to descending colon. Biopsies of these polyps showed that they were all tubular adenomas. At colonoscopy there were more than 100 small polyps throughout the colon but predominantly left-sided. There were no polyps found on esophagogastroduodenoscopy. DNA extracted from blood lymphocytes showed a truncating mutation in segment 1 of the APC gene by protein truncation analysis, confirming the diagnosis of FAP. A total colectomy was performed.\n\n【7】One year following colectomy, two firm, immobile intraabdominal masses were noted on physical examination. An ultrasound directed biopsy of the masses revealed fibromatosis.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【9】The thyroidectomy specimen was fixed in formalin, and representative paraffin-embedded sections were routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with the labelled streptovidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system using a panel of antibodies .\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Antibody information.</u>\n\n【11】##### 3.1. Pathology\n\n【12】The excised thyroid weighed 72 g and contained one nodule (5 × 4 × 4 cm) in the right lobe and three nodules in the left lobe ranging in size from 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.5 to 3 × 2.5 × 2.0 cm.\n\n【13】Light microscopic examination revealed that the three nodules in the left lobe were surrounded by fibrous capsules of varying thickness. The architectural patterns within the nodules were variable, but papillae were present at least focally in each tumor. The papillae were generally short and blunt with edematous cores. A prominent finding within all of the nodules were cribriform structures composed of follicles deficient in colloid and lined by flattened to low cuboidal epithelial cells with scant intervening fibrous tissue . Other portions of the tumor nodules had a trabecular arrangement of tall columnar cells. Frequently within these trabecular areas and to a lesser extent elsewhere, there were small whorls of cells . The tumor cell nuclei were oval and overlapping with irregular outlines. Nuclear grooves were readily identified and occasional typical intranuclear cytoplasmic pseudoinclusions were present. Many of the cells within the whorls had nuclei with a pale eosinophilic to clear appearance . There was no necrosis or mitotic activity present.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Histological features of CMV variant of PTC.

Beta-catenin immunostaining demonstrated nuclear localization within the tumor cells . There was no cytoplasmic reactivity for CK20, chromogranin, or S100. In all of the immunostained sections, including the negative controls, there was strong positivity within the tumor cell nuclei with the peculiar nuclear clearing described above.\n\n【16】Microscopic examination showed that the mass in the right lobe was a follicular adenoma.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【18】The extraintestinal associations of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are wellknown and include osteomas, epidermoid cysts, fibromatosis, adrenal, biliary, liver, and brain neoplasms (some kindreds with Turcot's syndrome) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> as well as thyroid carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. The risk of development of thyroid carcinoma in FAP is not known with certainty. A report from a large FAP registry indicated that 1.2% of affected individuals develop thyroid carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Two large studies of FAP patients found a relative risk of developing thyroid carcinoma of 7.6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and 23 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> compared to the general population. However, amongst females with polyposis, the risk has been estimated at 100–160 times greater than expected in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Some authors have recommended that FAP patients be screened for the development of thyroid carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>, but this is controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The FAP-associated thyroid tumors reported in the literature have been variably diagnosed as papillary, follicular, or mixed papillary and follicular carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported four cases of thyroid carcinoma in FAP patients with a review of the literature and noted the following unusual features: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>female : male ratio of 8 : 1 (2 : 1 to 4 : 1 in sporadic PTC); other studies have found an even more striking female predominance (f : m—17 : 1) for this particular subtye 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>,通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>majority under age 30 ( most in 30–50 age group in sporadic PTC),通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>multifocality (differing from sporadic PTC multifocality-tumors encapsulated, circumscribed, differing architectural patterns), and通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>unusual histologic patterns: cribriform, solid, spindling, and whorls.\n\n【20】The authors concluded that FAP-associated thyroid carcinomas were likely related to PTC, but were sufficiently different to warrant status as a distinct entity.\n\n【21】Based on the distinct and unusual morphology of the thyroid tumors occurring in FAP patients, Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> suggested that the recognition of such a tumor should prompt investigation for FAP. The investigation in the case reported herein led to a diagnosis of FAP, supporting their recommendation.\n\n【22】However, Cameselle-Teijeiro and Chan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> described 4 cases with similar or identical morphology apparently occurring in patients without FAP. Others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 12\\]</u> have also described similar tumors, again in patients without evidence of FAP. These tumors have been termed the “cribriform-morular” variant of PTC (CMV PTC) by Cameselle-Teijeiro and Chan in recognition of their two most prominent and unusual patterns. The cribriform areas are composed of anastomosing bars and arches of cells without intervening stroma with the follicular spaces devoid of colloid. The morulas are composed of spindled cells with “peculiar nuclear clearing.” These clear nuclei differ from both the optically clear nuclei and intranuclear pseudoinclusions more typically seen in PTC and consist of accumulations of biotin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> speculated that the morphology of this apparently distinctive tumor might be related to the involvement of the APC gene in the pathogenesis. Several groups have analyzed APC gene mutations. Cetta et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> analyzed four tumors from patients with known germline APC mutations. They found no examples of biallelic inactivation. Soravia et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> studied 9 samples from 4 tumors and found somatic APC mutation in 1 sample. However, Iwama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> found germline and somatic mutation of APC gene in 2 cases of FAP-associated thyroid carcinomas. These findings suggest that, although somatic mutation of APC gene may be seen in some cases of FAP-associated thyroid carcinoma, it is not a required step in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms. However, a number of studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14, 16\\]</u> have shown evidence of ret/PTC-1 oncogene activation, which is known to be an early molecular event in papillary thyroid carcinoma oncogenesis. This finding would support the concept that FAP-associated thyroid tumors are variants of PTC.\n\n【24】More recently Xu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> have demonstrated that aberrant nuclear accumulation of mutant beta-catenin may substitute for APC mutations in a subset of CMV of PTC . It is thought that these sporadic cases are due to a somatic mutation in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1), further highlighting the analogous role to the APC-beta-catenin pathway. Although only a small number of cases have been studied, the most common carcinogenic genetic abnormality in papillary thyroid carcinoma—BRAF mutation—appears to be absent in FAP-associated thyroid cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Thyroid carcinomas occurring in FAP patients have unusual clinical and pathological features, but morphologic and molecular evidence supports the concept that these are variants of PTC. Although the morphologic features are unusual and rarely seen in sporadic PTC, recent reports have emphasized that they are not specific for FAP. Nevertheless, they are sufficiently uncommon that their presence in a thyroid tumor should prompt investigation for FAP. This may be particularly important in the 20% of patients with FAP who have no family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:13:13", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:14:51", "cost": 97.605}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:14:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:13:12"}

It is not a neoplasm but is rather considered a nonspecific reactive response to chronic synovial irritation, due to either mechanical or inflammatory insults. We report three cases of lipoma arborescens affecting the knee, the first in a young male without previous history of arthritis or trauma, the second in a 58-year-old male associated with osteoarthritis, and the final in a 44-year-old male diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, which cover the entire pathologic spectrum of this unusual entity.

The patient complained of night knee pain that woke him up. He also stated that while knee swelling was growing, pain was reducing. He did not report prior trauma, surgery, or infection in his knee.\n\n【8】On clinical examination, there was painless, diffuse swelling in the suprapatellar area. The knee had full range of motion and showed no signs of meniscal lesions, nor anteroposterior and collateral instability.\n\n【9】All laboratory studies were normal.\n\n【10】Plain radiographs depicted an area of dense soft tissue in the suprapatellar pouch. The femur and tibia were normal, with normal joint space.\n\n【11】CT revealed a low-density intra-articular mass, similar to fat, with multiple villi, surrounded by joint fluid causing distention of the joint capsule.

Patient 2\n\n【23】A 58-year-old male presented with a 4-year history swelling and mild pain in both knees, especially in the right. The patients’ previous history was free of trauma, fever, or morning stiffness. No other joints were affected.\n\n【24】Clinical examination showed fullness in the suprapatellar and parapatellar regions of both knees. The swelling was more obvious in the right knee, with tenderness in the medial joint line. The cruciate and collateral ligaments as well as the menisci were intact clinically.\n\n【25】The patient was investigated for rheumatoid factor, serum uric acid, antinuclear antibody, and anti-dsDNA, apart from the routine blood examinations. All findings were normal.\n\n【26】X-rays established the diagnosis of osteoarthritis, with joint space narrowing and osteophytes on both knees, more pronounced on the right.\n\n【27】MRI of the right knee demonstrated severe medial compartment osteoarthritis, with marginal osteophytes, chondral lesions, subchondral changes, and a complex tear of the medial meniscus. Mild, villous, frond-like fatty subsynovial hyperplasia was present in the suprapatellar bursa, associated with joint effusion and synovial proliferation, which enhanced after iv administration of gadolinium.

Arthroscopic examination of the knee revealed a large amount of yellowish frond-like projections in the suprapatellar pouch, with degenerative changes of the cartilage in the medial and lateral compartment. Synovium was meticulously excised from the suprapatellar pouch and the medial and lateral gutter. Retropatellar fat pad was debrided as well.\n\n【30】Histopathological examination of the tissue revealed fibrous tissue and adipose cells in the subsynovial region, which were responsible for villous dilatation. The villi were covered by hyperplastic inflamed synovium.\n\n【31】The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient returned to his previous level of activity without restriction in the range of movement. There was no recurrence during a twenty-month follow-up period.\n\n【32】##### 2.3. Patient 3\n\n【33】A 44-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of pain and swelling in his right knee and feet. He did not report prior trauma or surgery in the affected knee.\n\n【34】Clinical examination disclosed a large amount of knee joint effusion, with restriction of knee movement. Skin examination demonstrated psoriatic plaques and ichthyosis. Blood tests showed C-reactive protein of 10 mg/l and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 20 mm/h. Antinuclear antibody and anti-dsDNA screen, as well as rheumatoid factor, were negative.

There was no recurrence up to 18 months after surgery.\n\n【46】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【47】LA is an unusual, intra-articular, benign lesion of synovium. The first detailed case report was by Arzimanoglu in 1957 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Since then, less than 100 have been reported according to Kamaci et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Most reports consist of just one case or a small series of this unusual lipoma, while Howe and Wenger described the largest series with 45 lesions in 39 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【48】Its etiology and pathogenesis are unknown. A history of trauma is reported in many patients with LA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Diabetes mellitus or steroid use have also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Lesions due to either degenerative or inflammatory arthritis are seen quite often, as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 9–11\\]</u>. Indeed, Howe and Wenger reported the presence of arthritic chondral damage at 36 of their 39 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Moreover, late treatment is related to early development of osteoarthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【49】According to Kloen et al. a typical patient with LA is an adult in the fourth or fifth decade of his life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Men and women are equally affected. Howe and Wenger describe unilateral knee involvement as typical, while atypical cases include both knees or involvement of other joints, such as shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip and ankle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7, 13–16\\]</u>. Patients complain of chronic, progressive, painless swelling of the involved joint. Effusion is almost always present, but limitations in range of movement and pain are not seen very often 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 13, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【50】Blood tests are normal and plain radiographs may show soft tissue density in the suprapatellar pouch when the knee is involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>.\n\n【51】MRI is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice and can demonstrate variable morphological patterns with pathognomonic characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 19\\]</u>. A large frond-like mass arising from the synovium is seen, with signal intensity similar to fat on all pulse sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–22\\]</u>. Alternatively, multiple villous proliferation of the synovium and fatty-appearing globules can be seen, while a mixed pattern can also appear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Although the subsynovial tissue does not enhance after iv administration of contrast medium, the synovial lining and the joint fluid may demonstrate enhancement, related to the presence of inflammatory cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Finally, the absence of magnetic susceptibility artifacts attributable to hemosiderin is also characteristic and useful in the differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【52】Although LA has characteristic features that usually make it a straightforward MRI diagnosis, other entities presenting as filling defects in the suprapatellar recess, such that osseous loose bodies, synovial chondromatosis, “rice bodies” accompanying rheumatoid arthritis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, quadriceps fat pad impingement, synovial hemangioma, intra-articular lipoma, and intra-articular liposarcoma may mimic LA and cause confusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>.\n\n【53】Macroscopically, LA appears as a yellowish synovial proliferation, with broad villous projections of fatty tissue arranged in an arborescent pattern, usually filling the suprapatellar pouch and both gutters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 25\\]</u>. Histologically, massive infiltration of the synovium by mature adipose cells is characteristic for LA. Enlarged hyperaemic capillaries and focal chronic inflammatory infiltration is usually observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【54】Although our first patient is a typical LA patient regarding age and MR imaging findings, his symptoms and clinical signs at time of presentation were quite atypical. A painful knee swelling is not so common in patients with LA. It is also very unusual that our patient’s knee was becoming less painful as swelling was progressing, a characteristic that has not been mentioned in other painful LAs. Moreover, night knee pain that awakens the patient has not been described in the literature so far being more commonly associated with bone sarcomas with an incidence ranging from 20 to 44% and may mislead to false diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26, 27\\]</u>.\n\n【55】The third case presented here is extremely rare and refers to unilateral LA in a patient with psoriatic arthritis. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two cases reported in the literature referring to concurrent psoriatic arthritis with LA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28, 29\\]</u>. However, in our patient, the MRI appearance is very unusual, with innumerable individual villi and with small quantities of interposed fluid, creating a feathery appearance. Areas of hypertrophic synovium with little or no fat deposition were also present. When LA develops in patients with chronic synovitis, as in this patient with psoriatic arthritis, areas of synovial thickening without fat deposition are often encountered.\n\n【56】LA is a benign tumor. Malignancy has not been reported, so biopsy is not regarded by some authors as an essential part of treatment algorithm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 25, 30, 31\\]</u>. However, considering the small number of cases with LA that have been described in the literature so far, as well as the fact that the pathology of this entity has not been clarified up till now, we believe that biopsy may be useful in selected cases. Recommended treatment is open synovectomy and recurrence after surgery is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 30\\]</u>. Arthroscopic synovectomy is also described in recent case reports, with comparable rates of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 30, 32\\]</u>. Chemical synovectomy with Yttrium has been used for temporal relief of the symptoms, but not as the definitive treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【57】When synovectomy is delayed more than a year from symptoms onset, early osteoarthritis may develop 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. One of the largest case series showed osteoarthritic signs two years postoperatively in all patients treated with a delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【58】Finally, although MRI with iv administration of gadolinium is extremely useful diagnostically, the definite diagnosis can only be established by histological examination, which reveals diffuse replacement of the subsynovial tissue with mature fat cells, causing villous expansion of the synovium, and inflammatory cells around capillaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 33\\]</u>.\n\n【59】In conclusion, LA is a relatively uncommon benign lesion, which typically affects knee joint, especially the suprapatellar pouch. It should always be considered in the spectrum of differential diagnosis when clinicians deal with chronic swelling, either painful or painless, of a joint. MRI findings are characteristic and early synovectomy offers the best functional outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:26:58", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:27:29", "cost": 30.553}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:27:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:26:58"}

However, there have been few reports on cases at high risk of postoperative complications. Cancer patients often have negative automatic thoughts about illness, and these negative automatic thoughts are associated with reduced health behavior and physical activity. This case series demonstrates the successful combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation for negative automatic thoughts in two cancer patients who underwent thoracic surgery. One patient underwent pneumonectomy with laryngeal recurrent nerve paralysis; the other patient, who had a history of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and dialysis, underwent S6 segmentectomy. Both patients had negative automatic thoughts about cancer-related stress and postoperative pain. The physical therapists conducted a perioperative rehabilitation program in which the patients were educated to replace their maladaptive thoughts with more adaptive thoughts. After rehabilitation, the patients had improved adaptive thoughts, increased physical activity, and favorable recovery without pulmonary complications. This indicates that the combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation was useful in two thoracic cancer surgery patients. The psychoeducational approach should be expanded to perioperative rehabilitation of patients with cancer.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Although thoracic surgery is necessary for the treatment of cancer, it carries the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Perioperative rehabilitation strategies recommended to prevent postoperative complications include lung expansion interventions, deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry, and ambulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Negative automatic thoughts are associated with reduced health behavior and physical activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. The psychoeducation for negative automatic thoughts reportedly enhances the adaptive coping and psychological wellbeing of cancer patients through the provision of medical and psychological information and the development of patient problem solving skills 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>; this approach has been investigated starting several days after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u> and after the initiation of immunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Negative automatic thoughts in cancer-related stress are expressed as helplessness, anxious preoccupation, fatalism, and avoidance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Negative automatic thoughts related to pain have also been successfully treated using the psychoeducation in the perioperative period in orthopedic surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Pain-related negative automatic thoughts are expressed as helplessness, rumination, and magnification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. Although the psychoeducational approach has been proven effective for negative automatic thoughts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7, 10, 11, 15\\]</u>, further investigation is needed into the benefit of psychoeducational approaches in cancer rehabilitation.\n\n【5】Herein, we report two cases in which patients with negative automatic thoughts underwent thoracic cancer surgery. These patients received the combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation for negative automatic thoughts.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Treatment\n\n【8】Treatment was provided by attending thoracic surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, and physical therapists. During the preoperative period, the patients received information about the operation and rehabilitation. After the operation, the patients were immediately extubated and transferred to intensive care unit. The patients started deep breathing, sitting, and standing by postoperative day 1 (POD1). Gait training was initiated after the patients returned to the general ward.\n\n【9】##### 2.2. Rehabilitation Program\n\n【10】The rehabilitation program, which included psychoeducation, was conducted from the time of admission (a few days before surgery) until discharge. The most important treatment goal was the prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications. Perioperative rehabilitation, including orientation and measurements, was performed by a specialized physical therapist (K.H.) with 5-year experience who was trained in psychoeducation and cognitive behavior therapy. Training consisted of guided discovery, identifying and countering negative automatic thoughts, pacing, graded activity, relaxation, and other skills. During the preoperative period, the physical therapist provided medical and psychological information specific to cancer and the perioperative condition, as well as the plan for postoperative rehabilitation. The goal of providing psychological information was to help the patients understand the influence of various stressors on physical and mental conditions and to motivate them to change their behavior to reduce stress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Patients were guided to explore their individual emotions, automatic thoughts, and beliefs based on Beck’s approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The therapist helped the patients to distinguish their emotions and thoughts from an external event. The patients were helped to identify particular cognitive distortions and to replace these negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes with more adaptive thoughts. The patients were educated in coping style and were encouraged to participate in more activities. The physical therapists went to the patients’ rooms several times a day for the first 3-4 days after the operation and checked their exercise level and thoughts. The presence of the physical therapists was then gradually reduced to facilitate independence. The 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) measured by the 6-minute walking test was performed during the preoperative period and at discharge by following a standardized procedure in room air 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Publication of these cases was approved by the ethics committee of Nagoya University Hospital (number 2015-0413).\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Case 1\n\n【13】##### 3.1. Pneumonectomy with Recurrent Nerve Paralysis\n\n【14】###### 3.1.1. Patient History\n\n【15】The patient was a 60-year-old man. He had a high school degree, lived alone, and worked until he was 60 years old. He smoked 30 cigarettes per day for 20 years until he was 40 years old. He had a history of moderate alcohol consumption for 20 years until he was 40 years old. He did not regularly exercise. This patient was referred to our university hospital for investigation of a cough with bloody sputum that had persisted for months. He had no other comorbidities.\n\n【16】Chest CT revealed a 6.3 × 5.2 cm mass located in the left central portion of the lung and enlarged hilar lymph nodes. The tumor was diagnosed as stage IIB (T2bN1M0) squamous cell carcinoma 6 months after the patient first experienced coughing symptoms.\n\n【17】Clinical findings on admission were normal, except that electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia (heartrate > 110 bpm) . The 6MWD immediately after admission was 493 m. The patient’s thoughts regarding his illness were as follows: “There is nothing I can do to help myself” and “I have put myself at the doctor.” These thoughts were similar to one of the items in the helplessness and fatalism maladaptive coping style 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Patient characteristics and response to treatment.</u>\n\n【19】###### 3.1.2. Perioperative Course\n\n【20】Medical and psychological information was provided during the preoperative period, and the modifying structured association counseling technique was performed throughout the study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The patient was provided with opportunities to remember how he had lived before his cancer diagnosis and was encouraged to be aware of how he was being affected by the stress of the cancer. The psychoeducation and information consisted of “stress and both physical and psychological reaction,” “stress and its related factors (including personality, self-esteem, and social support),” and “better attitude for living (including having a positive attitude, expressing negative emotions, getting social support, and the effectiveness of laughter).” The physical therapists helped the patient find ways to manage stressful situations and to better perform health behavior and physical activity.\n\n【21】The patient underwent a left pneumonectomy and combined resection of the left recurrent nerve. Operating time was 198 minutes, and blood loss was 105 mL. Postoperative diagnosis was stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma. The patient had tachycardia (heartrate > 110 bpm) and was given landiolol hydrochloride (3.39 μg/kg/min) on POD1. A tracheal tube was inserted via cricothyrotomy due to insufficient sputum expectoration. The patient returned to the general ward on POD2. Postoperative pain was managed with continuous epidural anesthesia, patient-controlled analgesia, and oral loxoprofen sodium. Oral intake without aspiration was possible on POD4. The patient’s thoughts were “I suffer from a lot of anxiety due to my disease,” “I have difficulty in believing this happened to me,” and “I distract myself when thoughts about my illness come into my head”; these thoughts were similar to one of the items in the anxious preoccupation and avoidance maladaptive coping style 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. However, the patient also thought “I try to fight the illness,” which was similar to one of the items in the fighting spirit of the adaptive coping style 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The patient could independently perform activities of daily living and was discharged home on POD16. The 6MWD at discharge was 455 m. The patient thought “I am determined to beat this disease” and “I see my illness as a challenge,” which was similar to one of the items in the fighting spirit of the adaptive coping style 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. After discharge, the patient regularly walked 30 minutes daily to improve physical function. The patient was not readmitted for any pulmonary complications.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Case  2\n\n【24】##### 4.1. S6 Segmentectomy with Comorbidities of Hepatic Encephalopathy and Dialysis\n\n【25】###### 4.1.1. Patient History\n\n【26】The patient was a 67-year-old man with hypertension who had undergone pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer 7 years ago. He also had noncirrhotic recurrent hepatic encephalopathy after shunting from the superior mesenteric vein to the inferior vena cava for a jejunal varicose vein for 3 years and dialysis for chronic kidney disease for 1 year. He had a high school degree, lived with family, and worked until he was 60 years old. He smoked 40 cigarettes per day for 30 years until he was 50 years old. He had no history of alcohol consumption. He did not regularly exercise.\n\n【27】Chest CT screening after pancreatoduodenectomy in our hospital revealed a 1.1 × 1.4 cm mass located in the right S6. The tumor was diagnosed as stage IV (T1aN0M1) lung metastasis of pancreas adenocarcinoma. The patient was advised to limit the use of postoperative analgesic drugs because of comorbidities. He had no signs of pleural effusion, ascites, disturbance of consciousness, or obvious fatigue. Clinical findings on admission were normal, except that the pulmonary function test revealed a mild restrictive defect . The 6MWD on admission was 372 m.\n\n【28】Preoperative pain-related psychological findings were measured using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), which consists of 13 items and gives a score ranging from 0 to 52 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 14\\]</u>. The PCS measures a subject’s perception of how frequently they have experienced negative automatic thoughts and predicts postoperative pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. The total PCS score was 23, and the subscales were 15 in rumination, 5 in magnification, and 3 in helplessness. The total PCS score was above the cutoff points of strong pain prediction, which have been reported to be 13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> or 16 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The patient’s thoughts were “I cannot seem to keep pain out of my mind” and “I keep thinking about how badly I want the pain to stop,” which was one of the items in the rumination of pain of the maladaptive coping style 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>.\n\n【29】###### 4.1.2. Perioperative Course\n\n【30】Medical and psychological information was provided during the preoperative period, and training to modify pain coping skills was performed throughout the study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The patient was provided with opportunities to recognize pain-related negative automatic thoughts, such as pain catastrophizing, and to replace these with alternative, rational, reassuring, adaptive thoughts.\n\n【31】###### 4.1.3. Postoperative Course\n\n【32】The patient underwent S6 segmentectomy of the right lung. The operating time was 87 minutes, and blood loss was 103 mL. The patient returned to the general ward on POD1. Postoperative analgesic drugs included continuous fentanyl (50 μg/hr) until POD2 and oral celecoxib (up to 200 mg per day as needed). Continuous epidural anesthesia and patient-controlled analgesia were not used because of comorbidities. Pain intensity using a 0–10 numerical rating scale was 8/10 on POD1, 5/10 on POD2, 3/10 on POD3 and POD4, and 0–2/10 on all subsequent days. The patient thought “I do something active, which diverts my attention away from the pain” and “I tell myself to be brave and carry on despite the pain,” which was similar to one of the items in the adaptive coping style 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Oral intake without aspiration was possible on POD6.\n\n【33】The patient was discharged home on POD19. The 6MWD at discharge was 344 m. The patient thought “I see my illness as a challenge,” which was similar to one of the items in the fighting spirit of the adaptive coping style 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. After discharge, the patient regularly walked for 20 minutes every day to improve his physical function. The patient was not readmitted for any pulmonary complications.\n\n【34】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【35】The present patients had negative automatic thoughts and were assessed as having high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications following thoracic surgery. These patients received combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation, which led to improved adaptive thoughts, increased physical activity, and favorable recovery.\n\n【36】Psychological intervention should be based on the individual patient’s specific goals for problem solving, not just a general coping strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Negative automatic thoughts are associated with reduced health behavior and physical activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Therefore, perioperative rehabilitation for cancer patients should focus not only on exercise, but also on psychoeducation for coping style. Successful exercise experiences can dramatically improve negative automatic thoughts. Physical therapists often initiate postoperative exercise, and so they should take the lead in psychoeducation to help patients replace negative thoughts with more adaptive coping styles during rehabilitation. As psychological constructs and QOL are worse in patients with short duration rather than long duration since diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–22\\]</u> and surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23–25\\]</u>, early combination treatment of rehabilitation and psychoeducation could be useful in cancer patients. Patients in the early postoperative phase experience pain and reduction of QOL, and therefore the treatment should be individualized for each patient’s symptoms.\n\n【37】Cancer patients often have psychological concerns and maladaptive coping styles about illness in the period from diagnosis to the completion of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26, 27\\]</u>, as observed in Case  . Perioperative psychological and physical changes occur before the patient is discharged. Hence, psychoeducation for effective coping strategies should be performed constantly during the perioperative period. Previous studies have reported that surgical patient outcomes are improved by patient education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28, 29\\]</u>, and the maladaptive coping style is a risk factor for psychiatric morbidity and decreased survival in cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26, 30–32\\]</u>. Further longitudinal psychological assessment and treatment are required from diagnosis to completion of treatment in cancer patients.\n\n【38】The patient in Case   had a high PCS score and marked postoperative pain. Preoperative pain catastrophizing predicts persistent postoperative pain in total joint replacement patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 33, 34\\]</u>. Marked postoperative pain prevents effective cough-up and deep breathing and increases the risks of postoperative complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. Positive coping for pain, such as thinking of things to distract them from the pain or engaging in active behaviors that divert attention away from the pain, is useful for health behavior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The psychoeducation for the maladaptive coping style in pain should be performed perioperatively.\n\n【39】This case report has several limitations. The negative automatic thoughts were assessed mainly by medical interview. Several short screening tools about negative automatic thoughts have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. Development of simple psychological assessment tools for perioperative cancer patients is required.\n\n【40】#### 6\\. Conclusions\n\n【41】The combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation is useful for improving automatic thoughts and behaviors about illness and leads to favorable recovery in thoracic cancer surgery. The psychoeducational approach should be expanded to perioperative cancer patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:48:02", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:48:31", "cost": 29.216}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:48:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:48:01"}

First branchial cleft anomalies (FBCA) are rare clinical entities of the head and neck. Typically, the tract of the FBCA begins in the external auditory canal and ends in the postauricular or submandibular region. Case Presentation. We present a case of a 23-year-old man who had a first branchial cleft fistula with atypical opening on the root of the helical crus. Complete excision of the tract, including the cuff of surrounding cartilage, was performed. Histopathology revealed a fistular tract lined with squamous epithelium. To our knowledge, this is the first case to be reported of type I FBCA with an opening on the root of the helical crus. The low incidence and varied presentation often result in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Conclusions. In the patients with FBCA, careful recognition of atypical variants is essential for complete excision.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】First branchial cleft anomalies (FBCA) are very rare and account for less than 10% of all branchial cleft anomalies. Work reported a classification system based on embryology and histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Type I anomalies are ectodermal in origin and arise from the duplication of the membranous external auditory canal. Type II anomalies are ectodermal and mesodermal in origin and arise from the duplication of the membranous and cartilaginous external auditory canal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The superior openings of these anomalies are commonly located on the floor of the external auditory canal. Herein, we report the first case of a branchial cleft fistula with the superior opening located on the root of the helical crus, extending into the postauricular crease.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 23-year-old man was referred to our clinic with postauricular drainage and swelling. He had a 10-year history of recurrent swelling in the postauricular area. Physical examination revealed a fistulous tract extending from the root of the helical crus to the postauricular crease. The lower opening in the postauricular area was surrounded by a reddish cystic lesion . The patient had no history of facial weakness. A preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan showed a left rim-enhancing cyst in the postauricular crease . Postauricular discharge was purulent and was treated with antibiotics. On suspicion of a branchial cleft fistula, surgical resection of the fistula was scheduled. A postauricular incision including an ellipse around the lower opening was performed. The tract and lower opening, including the surrounding skin, were excised. The tract was traced anteriorly to the helical crus and a portion of helical cartilage was excised in continuity with the tract . The tract was identified as superficial to the facial nerve. Histopathology revealed that the excised tissue was a fistula lined with squamous epithelium . The patient received intravenous antibiotics for 3 days and oral antibiotics for 2 weeks as a precautionary measure. The wound completely resolved after 1 month. During the 24-month follow-up, no sign of recurrence was found.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The opening of the fistula tract is seen on the root of the helical crus (a).

Discussion\n\n【11】FBCAs occur due to abnormal development of the branchial apparatus during weeks 4 to 7 of fetal life. The structures that develop from the first branchial cleft are the cavum conchae, external auditory canal, and outer layer of the tympanic membrane. Therefore, FBCAs are closely related to these structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Incomplete closure causes various types of first branchial cleft anomalies such as cysts, sinuses, and fistulas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The embryology of these anomalies reveals that the lesions are derived from the dorsal portion of the first branchial groove and lie between the derivatives of Meckel’s and Reichert’s cartilages. Therefore, the opening of the tract could occur anywhere, including in the external auditory canal, the postauricular region, or the neck over the angle of the mandible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Type I anomalies are purely ectodermal origin and contain squamous epithelium; this type of anomaly develops medial to the concha, often extending into the postauricular crease and ending in a cul-de-sac at the osseous-cartilaginous junction of the external auditory canal. These anomalies are usually superficial to the branch of the facial nerve. Type II anomalies are ectodermal and mesodermal in origin and thus contain adnexal skin structures and cartilages. The openings of the anomalies are usually below the angle of the mandible and extend toward the inferior part of the external auditory canal; the anomalies pass superficial to, deep to, or between the branches of the facial nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Type I FBCAs are very rare, while type II FBCAs are more frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【13】In the present case, the histopathological characteristics of the tract extending from the root of the helix to the postauricular crease showed only squamous epithelium and no cartilage. There was no visible opening of the fistula in the external auditory canal. The lesion was superficial to the facial nerve. On the basis of these characteristics, we classified the anomaly as a type I FBCA. The most frequent clinical feature of a type I FBCA is ear discharge or recurrent periauricular swelling. The rare incidence and varied presentation often lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, such as multiple incision and drainage procedures. Inappropriate treatments and recurrent infection may result in incomplete excision. When there is a history of prior infection, the recurrence rate of FBCAs can be as high as 14–22% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Definitive treatment for an FBCA is surgical excision of the entire anomaly, including a small amount of surrounding skin or cartilage. Accordingly, we excised the anomaly, including a small portion of the surrounding cartilage.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【15】Atypical variants of FBCA exist, and various presentations make diagnosis and treatment difficult. Careful examination and dissection are crucial to avoid rest of the anomalies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:16:25", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:16:32", "cost": 6.923}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:16:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:16:24"}

Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a potentially life-threatening autoimmune hemostatic disorder where autoantibodies that disrupt the functions of factor VIII (FVIII) are present in the circulation. The early diagnosis of AHA is difficult since the symptoms of AHA differ from those of congenital hemophilia A. Furthermore, the management of AHA is also more complex due to the presence of autoantibodies against FVIII (FVIII inhibitors). Here, we present three case reports and conduct a literature review of AHA with the aim to increase awareness and knowledge regarding the diagnosis and treatment of AHA. Case Presentations. We present three patients diagnosed with AHA in these case reports. The first patient was a young female, while the second and third patients were middle-aged and elderly males, respectively. All patients presented with a chief complaint of bruises without hemarthrosis and a history of bleeding. Laboratory examinations of the patients revealed isolated prolonged aPTT, normal PT, and the presence of autoantibodies against factor VIII, which are characteristics of AHA. Patients were then treated with corticosteroids to reduce the titer level of autoantibodies and received factor VIII transfusion to stop bleeding. Conclusion. AHA can be suspected in patients presenting with symptoms of bruises without hemarthrosis and without the history of bleeding. Isolated aPTT elevation with normal PT should raise high suspicion of AHA. The presence of FVIII inhibitors can help to confirm the diagnosis of AHA. Treatment consists of factor VIII transfusion and corticosteroid therapy. Bypassing agents are recommended as an alternative to FVIII transfusion.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare but potentially life-threatening autoimmune hemostatic disorder where autoantibodies against factor VIII are present in circulation due to a failure in immune tolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. There are several fundamental differences between AHA and congenital factor VIII deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. The first is the presence of autoantibodies which neutralize the function of factor VIII in AHA. Second, the majority of AHA patients have cutaneous and intramuscular hemorrhage instead of hemarthrosis, which is commonly observed in congenital hemophilia A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>. Additionally, the symptoms of AHA also vary across patients, with some having mild symptoms and others having major bleeding, which complicates diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. Due to these differences and the lack of a past medical history of bleeding in many AHA patients, AHA is often not suspected or its diagnosis is difficult, which may delay the administration of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 7\\]</u>. Since the mortality rate of AHA is high, early diagnosis and management are important in reducing negative outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 7–9\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The incidence rate of AHA has been estimated at around 1.2–1.48 cases per million people every year, with a mortality rate of around 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–11\\]</u>. Additionally, the incidence of AHA increases with age, with the elderly population being highly predisposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 12, 13\\]</u>. Furthermore, AHA may be associated with pregnancy, autoimmune diseases, and cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 12, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here, we present case reports of AHA in three patients (a young female, middle-aged male, and elderly male) treated with either corticosteroids only or in combination with cyclophosphamide. By studying these cases and reviewing the recent guidelines, we humbly hope that this article may increase awareness and knowledge regarding the diagnosis and treatment of AHA.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentations\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【8】An 18-year-old female presented on 7 April 2019 with a chief complaint of bruises on both legs in the past 2 weeks, which were painless but becoming larger over time. The patient also complained of an unhealed abdominal surgical wound 1 month after surgery due to a ruptured cyst in the right ovary.\n\n【9】Two months prior, the patient suffered a fall and was taken to a traditional massage therapist. However, she complained of small bruises after receiving the massage. Furthermore, the bruises increased in size over time. She was then treated with tranexamic acid at a clinic, with only slight improvement. She admitted that bruising had occurred easily throughout the previous year; however, she never consulted a physician because the bruises were relatively small and healed spontaneously. The patient denied having any history of liver dysfunction, blood clotting disorder, allergy, or any chronic disease. Similarly, the patient’s mother also denied having any similar history of bleeding in the family.\n\n【10】On 7 April 2019, a physical examination of the patient was undertaken, showing stable vital signs and no other abnormalities. Laboratory investigation of blood taken on the same day revealed a normal complete blood count, normal PT of 10.7 s (normal value of 9.8–11.2 s), prolonged aPTT of 113.2 s (normal value of 31.0–47.0 s), elevated D-dimer of 610 μg/L (normal value of <440 μg/L), normal liver function, and normal kidney function. Additional laboratory results for factor VIII and factor IX levels were <1% (normal: 40–170%) and 63.5% (normal: 51–137%), respectively. Accordingly, factor VIII inhibitors were detected at 105.00 Bethesda units (BU) (normal: not detected). The patient was diagnosed with AHA on the basis of these clinical presentations and laboratory findings.\n\n【11】The next day, the patient underwent additional laboratory tests to exclude autoimmune diseases. These tests showed an ANA score of 1/320 with homogeneous patterns, while tests of anti-dsDNA, C3, and C4 were within normal limits. These results showed that autoimmune diseases were unlikely to be a precipitating factor of AHA.\n\n【12】The patient was treated with both tranexamic acid (3 × 1000 mg) and injection of human factor VIII (2000 IU) for 2 days (8-9 April 2019); however, there was no significant clinical improvement. On 9 April 2019, it was decided to treat the patient with methylprednisolone (3 × 16 mg; equivalent to a prednisone dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 1 month). After 1 month of follow-up, her clinical presentation and laboratory parameters showed improvements. The corticosteroid treatment was then continued. In the second month, the methylprednisolone dose was reduced to 2 × 16 mg. Subsequently, in the third month, it was tapered to 24 mg (16–0–8 mg). In the fourth month of treatment, bruising no longer occurred. The methylprednisolone therapy was nevertheless continued with a dose of 2 × 8 mg, which was reduced by 4 mg weekly until the patient achieved steroid-free status. No relapse in terms of bruises or bleeding was observed after 6 months without steroid. Timeline of events for case 1 is shown in Figure 1.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Timeline of events and interventions for case 1.</u>\n\n【14】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【15】A 52-year-old male presented on 4 August 2019 with a chief complaint of bruises on all four limbs for the previous 3 weeks. The bruises were accompanied by swelling. According to the patient, the bruises first spontaneously appeared on his left foot before and later also spreading to other limbs.\n\n【16】The medical history was unremarkable, with the patient denying any history of trauma, prior liver dysfunction, chronic diseases, medications use, and blood clotting disorder. Additionally, the patient also denied having any similar history of bleeding in the family. Laboratory examinations on 5 August 2019 showed a prolonged aPTT of 87.8 s, decreased factor VIII level of 1.33%, and presence of factor VIII inhibitor at 106.80 BU (normal: not detected). Hence, the patient was diagnosed with AHA on the basis of the clinical manifestations and laboratory results.\n\n【17】On 5 August 2019, the patient received human factor VIII injections (3 × 2000 IU for 1 day), which then continued with a dose of 2 × 2000 IU for 2 days. Other treatments received by the patient were 3 × 1000 mg of tranexamic acid and 500 cc of a packed red cells transfusion. Furthermore, the patient was given methylprednisolone (1 × 125 mg IV for 5 days), with the dose subsequently reduced to 1 × 62.5 mg IV for 4 days.\n\n【18】On 13 August 2019, a second evaluation of factor VIII inhibitor and factor VIII levels was carried out, which showed improvements: 26.24 BU (normal: not detected) and 3.8% (normal: 40–170%). Meanwhile, the bruises on all four limbs were still present but had faded when compared with before, indicating a clinical improvement. On 14 August 2019, the dose of methylprednisolone was reduced to 3 × 16 mg PO for 2 weeks with the plan to reduce the dose further to 8 mg per week for the next 2 weeks. On the same day, tranexamic acid therapy was halted based on the improvements in bruises. The patient was then discharged from the hospital on 14 August 2019 and scheduled for an outpatient visit.\n\n【19】However, on 15 August 2019, the patient was admitted to the emergency unit after he accidentally fell while walking. Wide bruises appeared around the buttocks and groin, accompanied by pain. His laboratory tests revealed 7.1 g/dL of Hb and an aPTT of 47.8 s (normal: 31.0–47.0 seconds). As a result, the patient received supporting treatments consisting of packed red cells transfusion and human factor VIII injections (2 × 2000 IU for 3 days). Subsequently, recombinant factor VIII was used instead of factor VIII injections (2 × 1500 IU for 3 days), with the dose subsequently reduced to 1 × 1500 IU for 10 days and then 1 × 1500 IU every 2 days until the patient was discharged. The patient was also given methylprednisolone (32–32–16 mg) during the first 3 weeks of treatment, before continuing with 32–32–8 mg during the last week. Throughout the treatment period, the patient was also examined several times to exclude the possibility of having an autoimmune disease and cancer. The results for ANA and anti-dsDNA were negative. Furthermore, C3 and C4 were within normal limits.\n\n【20】On 12 September 2019, there were significant improvements in clinical and coagulation parameters, with an aPTT of 31.5 s, factor VIII level of 33.2%, and an undetectable level of the factor VIII inhibitor. The patient was eventually discharged on 14 September 2019 and prescribed oral methylprednisolone (32–0–32 mg daily). The patient was advised to check his aPTT level every month, as well as factor VIII and factor VIII inhibitor levels 3 months later (January 2020), which were 8.1% and 3.16 BU, respectively. On the basis of these laboratory results, administration of cyclophosphamide tablets (2 mg/kg/day for 3 months) was considered according to a dose of 2 × 100 mg based on bodyweight of 96 kg. After the first 3 weeks of cyclophosphamide administration, factor VIII levels increased to 13.5%, whereas the inhibitor level was undetectable. Timeline of events for case 2 is shown in Figure 2.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Timeline of events and interventions for case 2.</u>\n\n【22】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【23】An 87-year-old male patient was admitted on 3 January 2019 for swelling and painless bruising in his left hand for the past month. The patient denied any history of trauma, prior liver dysfunction, or blood clotting disorder. Furthermore, the patient also denied having any similar history of bleeding in the family. The patient had comorbidities of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IIIB and prior cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n【24】One month prior to his admission, the patient had already been clinically diagnosed with AHA based on his clinical manifestations and laboratory findings (aPTT of 84.7 s) at a hospital in a different province. At that time, the patient was hospitalized and received a fresh frozen plasma transfusion, packed red cells PRC transfusion, and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient was then referred to a tertiary hospital for further evaluation.\n\n【25】A physical examination revealed the patient’s blood pressure to be 159/90 mmHg, while other vital signs were stable. The initial complete blood count after a laboratory examination highlighted a hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.200/μL, and platelet count of 305.000/μL. The coagulation results showed an aPTT of 81.8 s (normal: 31.0–47.0 s). Further laboratory results showed a blood urea level of 107.9 mg/dL and serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dL.\n\n【26】Considering his clinical manifestation and prolonged aPTT, the patient was evaluated for factor VIII, factor IX, and factor VIII inhibitors, which were measured as <1% (normal: 40–170%), 109.5% (normal: 51–137%), and 10.56 BU (normal: undetected), respectively. Hence, the patient was diagnosed with AHA and chronic kidney disease.\n\n【27】The patient was orally administered methylprednisolone (3 × 16 mg) on 4 January 2019, before reducing the dose to 2 × 32 mg the next day and 2 × 16 mg on 14 January 2019. The patient also received human factor VIII injections (2 × 1000 IU starting on 4 January 2019 for 11 days) and cyclophosphamide (1 × 50 mg). On 14 January 2019, the factor VIII inhibitor level was reduced to 1.76 BU, and the aPTT was reduced to 43.2 s. On 29 January, the patient had no complaints; thus, he was discharged and prescribed methylprednisolone (2 × 16 mg) for 2 months. On the day of discharge, the patient’s aPTT was normal at 39.5 s (normal range: 31.0–47.0 s). Timeline of events for case 3 is shown in Figure 3.\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Timeline of events and interventions for case 3.</u>\n\n【29】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【30】##### 3.1. Diagnosis\n\n【31】The proper diagnosis of AHA is very important due to the associated mortality that results from severe bleeding. However, diagnosis is very challenging due to the rarity of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 7, 9\\]</u>. Another complicating factor is that AHA patients often have no history of bleeding or anticoagulant use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>. Furthermore, in contrast to hemarthroses which is common in congenital hemophilia A, bleeding in AHA predominantly occurs from the skin, muscles, and mucous membranes, making the symptoms nonspecific at best and confusing at worst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 7, 14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Well-written clinical guidelines presented by Tiede et al. Kruse-Jarres et al. and Shetty et al. identified the first diagnostic pathway for suspected AHA as aPTT measurement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 17\\]</u>. The reason for this is that in AHA, there is often an isolated prolonged APTT without other abnormalities in coagulation, such as a prolonged PT or abnormal platelet count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 16, 17\\]</u>. However, an isolated prolonged aPTT can also be caused by deficiencies in other coagulation factors, such as FIX, FXI, and FXII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Hence, additional diagnostic modalities are recommended to properly diagnose AHA.\n\n【33】An aPTT mixing test is helpful in differentiating causes of isolated prolonged aPTT. In a mixing test, the patient’s plasma is mixed with an equivalent volume of normal plasma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. If a coagulation factor inhibitor is present, such as in AHA, the mixed plasma will still result in a prolonged aPTT due to the inhibition of coagulation factors. On the other hand, in a patient with only a coagulation factor deficiency (FVIII, FIX, FXI, and FXII), the mixing test would normalize the coagulation factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 16, 18\\]</u>.\n\n【34】The guidelines presented by Tiede et al. and Shetty et al. recommend conducting a mixing test after the aPTT test. By contrast, the guidelines by Kruse-Jarres et al. recommend that a FVIII activity concentration test be carried out in place of the mixing test (and after the aPTT test), which is only necessary if the FVIII test is unavailable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 17\\]</u>. Both Tiede et al. and Shetty et al. also recommended a FVIII test, but only after the mixing test is conducted. We agree with recommendation of Kruse-Jarres et al. that a mixing test may not be needed and can be skipped if an AHA diagnosis can already be confirmed by the low FVIII activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Another argument against the use of the mixing test is its lack of adequate standardization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【35】The measurement of the FVIII activity after aPTT test or mixing test is important as it can differentiate between the presence of AHA or lupus anticoagulants. A normal FVIII activity (≥50%) is highly indicative of lupus anticoagulants or other inhibitors such as FIX and FXI inhibitors, whereas a reduced FVIII activity level (<50%) instead indicates AHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16\\]</u>. The presence of lupus anticoagulants can be excluded using the dilute Russell’s viper venom time (dRVVT) assay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The final step of AHA diagnosis is a Bethesda assay to detect and measure FVIII autoantibodies in Bethesda units (BU) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【36】##### 3.2. Role of Hemostatic Agents\n\n【37】There are three focused objectives in AHA therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 12, 15\\]</u>. The first objective is to control and prevent further bleeding, if present, to maintain the patient’s vitals. The second objective is to eradicate factor VIII inhibitors in order to achieve complete remission. The third objective is to treat the underlying cause of the disease, if there is any.\n\n【38】For the first objective of bleeding control, hemostatic agents may be used. Currently, there are two types of hemostatic agents applied in AHA treatment: FVIII replacement therapy and bypassing agent (BPA) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 12, 15, 21\\]</u>. Human FVIII (hFVIII) replacement therapy has been a mainstay treatment for congenital hemophilia A. However, hFVIII is not effective in the presence of high anti-FVIII inhibitor titers, which may quickly neutralize the transfused hFVIII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Nevertheless, when the antibody titer is <5 BU or BPA is not available, hFVIII replacement therapy can still be used as a first-line treatment, although the dose required is often high and the response may be unpredictable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 7\\]</u>. Indeed, a recent guideline by the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) in year 2020 also supported the use of FVIII replacement therapy for AHA patients with low-responding inhibitors (antibody titer < 5 BU) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【39】The issue of hFVIII inhibition such as in AHA patients with high antibody titer can be solved by using recombinant porcine-derived FVIII (rpFVIII), which should not be neutralized by the autoantibodies theoretically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. However, there have been several observations in the literature of some AHA patients having inhibitors which cross-react with rpFVIII, resulting in a lack of or reduction in response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24–26\\]</u>. On the other hand, some patients may develop antiporcine FVIII antibody during therapy of rpFVIII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The recommended dose of rpFVIII is 50–100 U/kg for patients with no detected antiporcine FVIII inhibitor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. If there is a detectable antiporcine FVIII inhibitor, the dose should be increased to 200 U/kg for severe bleeding; however, the dose remains 50–100 U/kg for less severe bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Several literatures have recommended BPAs, which activate blood clotting without a need for factor VIII, instead of using recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) or plasma-derived activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) to control bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 17, 27–29\\]</u>. Physiologically, FVIII activates FX in the coagulation cascade pathway. However, FX can also be activated both directly and indirectly by rFVIIa through tissue FVIIa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Hence, a BPA such as rFVIIa can “bypass” the normal coagulation activation from FVIII, which is blocked by FVIII inhibitory antibodies. In the EACH2 study, rFVIIa and aPCC showed no significant difference in bleeding outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. However, it should be noted that there is a potential for rare thrombosis side effects from the use of BPAs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 17, 31, 32\\]</u>. The recommended dosage of aPCC is 50–100 U/kg every 8−12 h, whereas that for rFVIIa is 90 μg/kg every 2-3 h 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Generally, all AHA patients with bleeding should be administered hemostatic treatment. The choice of treatment depends mainly on treatment availability. BPAs should be chosen over replacement therapy if possible due to the advantage provided 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 16, 17\\]</u>. The main limitations of BPAs are their expensive cost and lack of availability in several countries, where they are, thus, not the main treatment of choice, such as in Indonesia and other developing countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. In these countries, factor VIII transfusion, therefore, remains the treatment of choice. A summary of the hemostatic therapies found in the literature is presented in Table 1.\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of hemostatic therapies found in the literature.</u>\n\n【43】##### 3.3. Role of Tranexamic Acid and Desmopressin\n\n【44】Other hemostatic approaches, e.g. a combination of tranexamic acid with aPCC or rFVIIa, can help in maintaining clot stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 33–35\\]</u>. A study by Hvas et al. showed that a dose of 10 mg/kg is sufficient to achieve these effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.\n\n【45】Desmopressin which works by increasing FVIII plasma concentrations transiently through FVIII secretion from endothelial cells should only be used for mild bleeding and low titer inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 36, 37\\]</u>.\n\n【46】##### 3.4. Role of Immunosuppressive Therapies\n\n【47】The elimination of factor VIII inhibitors can prevent future bleeding in AHA patients. The eradication of inhibitors using immunosuppressive therapy is recommended for all adults with AHA, despite some articles reporting that the presence of inhibitors can be spontaneously resolved to undetected levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. The consideration of this recommendation is based on the substantial mortality rate, morbidity rate, and cost of hemostatic treatment of acute bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, due to risk of infections from immunosuppressive therapies which may cause mortality, extreme caution should be exercised 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【48】There are currently three recommended immunosuppressive treatments: corticosteroid alone, corticosteroid combined with cyclophosphamide, or corticosteroid combined with rituximab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 16\\]</u>. The corticosteroid dose can either be 1 mg/kg prednisone daily or 40 mg dexamethasone daily for 3-4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16\\]</u>. The cyclophosphamide dose should be 1-2 mg/kg, whereas that for rituximab should be 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV weekly for 4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. A summary of inhibitor eradication therapies found in the literature is presented in Table 2.\n\n【49】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Summary of recommended inhibitor eradication therapies found in the literature.</u>\n\n【50】About 60–80% of patients achieved complete remission after a median of 5-6 weeks on immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Whether the administration of a corticosteroid combined with cyclophosphamide produces a better response than corticosteroid alone is still unclear. One study showed no statistically significant difference in median time to remission between both groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In contrast, the EACH2 study showed faster remission in patients receiving combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide when compared with steroids only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Furthermore, a meta-analysis by Delgado et al. showed that the cyclophosphamide, with or without corticosteroids, was associated with better complete remission than corticosteroids only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>.\n\n【51】For rituximab, it is not shown to be superior than corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide in the EACH2 study; however, rituximab use was associated with longer time to remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Currently, many guidelines recommend rituximab as second-line therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 16, 17, 28\\]</u>.\n\n【52】According to a prognostic study by Tiede et al. a low FVIII activity (<1 IU/dL) and >20 BU inhibitor titer were associated with a lower partial remission rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Furthermore, factors such as age, gender, and underlying disorder did not affect the partial remission rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. The same study also observed that low FVIII activity (<1 IU/dL), >20 BU inhibitor titer, and age >74 years were predictors of poor overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Hence, it is recommended that corticosteroids be combined with rituximab or a cytotoxic agent such as cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy in patients with low FVIII activity and >20 BU inhibitor titer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【53】##### 3.5. Role of Intravenous Immunoglobulin\n\n【54】The role of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as a first-line therapy exhibits no benefits, as shown by Delgado et al. in a review and meta-analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Subsequent evidence also does not support the use of intravenous immunoglobulin for inhibitor eradication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 38\\]</u>. For example, the EACH2 study showed no significant improvement from adding IVIG to immunosuppressive therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Hence, IVIG is not recommended over other immunosuppressive therapies previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【55】##### 3.6. Lessons Learned\n\n【56】The first case report we presented demonstrates that AHA can occur in young females unrelated to pregnancy or autoimmune disease. A lack of pregnancy, therefore, does not necessarily exclude AHA diagnosis. Furthermore, we also reported two cases of idiopathic AHA. According to the cases above, an isolated subcutaneous hematoma without any bleeding history or other risk factors should warrant suspicion of AHA. Patients suspected of AHA should be screened for potential causes of AHA such as malignant diseases and autoimmune diseases.\n\n【57】Although it has been shown that the bleeding symptoms in AHA are usually severe, physicians should also be aware that mild bleeding can also occur in AHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 16, 41\\]</u>. A thorough laboratory examination must be performed to establish the diagnosis of AHA. Important laboratory examinations for AHA include the aPTT, mixing test, FVIII activity level, and FVIII inhibitor level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 12, 16\\]</u>. However, considering the presented cases, we argue that the mixing test may not be needed if an FVIII concentration test is available. Additional examinations for differential diagnoses, such as of lupus anticoagulants and VWF, may not be required in cases of low FVIII levels if there is a positive result in the Bethesda assay.\n\n【58】The treatment of AHA consists of hemostatic management and immunosuppressive therapy. The former constitutes BPAs as the first-line therapy, with FVIII replacement therapy used if BPA is not available. The latter is indicated as a combination therapy when high FVIII inhibitor titers and low FVIII levels are detected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【59】These cases also demonstrate the poor correlation of FVIII inhibitor levels with bleeding severity. Therefore, physicians should make treatment decisions based not only on FVIII inhibitor levels but also the severity of bleeding symptoms.\n\n【60】##### 3.7. Strengths and Limitations\n\n【61】The limitation of this case report is the lack of complete and uniform laboratory examinations in all patients. Additionally, the diagnostic and treatment pathways that followed differed from those in the recommended guidelines; however, due to these differences, the case reports offer new perspectives that can be beneficial for clinical practice, especially in developing countries where resources are limited, since all patients achieved clinical recoveries. Last, the follow-up of some patients after treatment was not long enough.\n\n【62】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【63】AHA is a rare hematologic disorder where factor VIII becomes inactive due to autoantibody formation. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. As it tends to occur in patients with an unknown history of bleeding disorders, early diagnosis is often difficult. Diagnosis of AHA is determined on the basis of the detection of low factor VIII levels in the presence of factor VIII inhibitors. The principles of AHA therapy involve controlling and preventing further bleeding, eradicating factor VIII inhibitors, and treating the underlying cause of the disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:37:33", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:38:01", "cost": 28.066}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:37:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:37:31"}

The congenital form, according to the main theory, originates from embryonic cells of the 1st and 2nd branchial arch. The acquired form may be due to traumatic or iatrogenic causes and as a result of the occlusion of a sebaceous gland duct. Its occurrence is less and is estimated to be from 1.6 to 6.4% of the dermoid cysts of the body in adults and 0.29% of the head and neck tumors occurring in children. They may also be classified as anatomical and histological. Anatomically, they are divided into median genioglossal, median geniohyoid, and lateral cysts, while histologically they are divided into epidermoid, dermoid cysts and teratomas. Clinically, a distinction between supra and inferior type as well as between central and lateral type is proposed in relation to themylohyoidmuscle and themidline, respectively. Histologically, an estimation of dermoid, epidermoid, and teratoid cysts is reported. Enucleation via intraoral and/or extraoral approach is the method of treatment. Two case reports of dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth are presented in this paper, and an evaluation with regard to pathology, clinical findings, differential diagnosis, and treatment is discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The term “dermoid cyst” in the floor of the mouth is used to describe three types of histologically related cysts: dermoid, epidermoid, and teratomata/teratoid cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth have been the subject of a good many researches. Jourdain 通用删除7(英):<u>(1778)</u> called them sublingual dermoid cysts. Roser 通用删除7(英):<u>(1859)</u> maintained that many cases of ranula and sebaceous cysts on the base of the tongue were dermoid cysts. Bytlin 通用删除7(英):<u>(1885)</u> was preoccupied with their description but also not only with their differentiation from other similar lesions of this area, while Chairi 通用删除7(英):<u>(1891)</u> proposed that the tumors in the floor of the mouth originated from the entrapment of epidermoid cells at the embryonic age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Dermoid cysts occur primarily in sites where embryonic parts fuse together. The majority of reported cases are in the midline of the body and especially in testis and ovaries. In the head and neck region, they occur most frequently in the periorbital area, while 6.5% of dermoid cysts in this region present in the oral cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The incidence of floor of the mouth cysts is quite less 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In a study carried out by Mayo Clinic 通用删除7(英):<u>(1937)</u>, in a total of 1495 dermoid cysts of the body, 103 (6.9%) concerned the head and neck and only 24 (1.6%) the floor of the mouth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>, even though these findings have been challenged on account of the high (44%) rate of hair follicle cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. In another study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, of a total of 541 evident dermoid cysts of the body, 184 (34%) occurred in the head and neck and 35 (6.5%) of these in the floor of the mouth. Lastly, in yet another study, out of 1007 tumors of the head and neck area in children, 95 (9.4%) were dermoid cysts and only 3 (0.3%) occurred in the floor of the mouth.\n\n【5】The present paper deals with two cases of dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth and at the same time discusses the pathology, clinical picture, and treatment as well as the differentiation of these cysts within a broad spectrum of oncomorphous lesions in this area.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Case Report 1\n\n【8】A 21-year-old female patient came to the consultation unit of the maxillafacial surgery department to be examined for a semihard, painless, slowly evolving submental augmentation which had appeared 5 years before . The intraoral examination showed a nodular mass in the floor of the mouth with some floating in palpation. Extraorally, there was a small swelling in the submental region with the skin intact. The young girl complained of a progressive dysphagia and dysarthria during the last 6 months, regardless of the previous small mass in the area.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | The semihard, painless, slowly evolving augmentation in the submental area. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【10】The (ECHO) ultrasonic scan showed an infrasonic formation with distinct boundaries .

Discussion\n\n【30】The term “dermoid cyst” in the floor of the mouth is used to describe three types of histologically related cysts in this area: dermoid, epidermoid, and teratomata/teratoid cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth have been the subject of a considerable number of researches. Dermoid cysts may be classified into 2 major categories: congenital and acquired forms.\n\n【31】In international bibliography, reference is made to 3 theories with regard to the origin of cysts in the floor of the mouth. According to the 1st and most prevalent theory, these cysts originate from embryonic cells of the 1st and 2nd branchial arch entrapped in the mesenchyme of the area during the 3rd/4th week of embryonic life. With regard to the 2nd theory, it explains the pathogenic mechanism of the acquired form. The acquired cysts may be due to the implantation of epithelial cells subsequent to accidental or surgical injury (traumatic causes, iatrogenic antecedents, or an occlusion of a sebaceous gland duct).\n\n【32】Lastly, the 3rd theory maintains that these cysts are considered a variation of the cyst of the thyroglossal pore 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–13\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Anatomically, it is possible to distinguish 3 different types of dermoid cysts: median genioglossal, median geniohyoid, and lateral cysts, according to the anatomic relationship between the cyst and the muscles of the floor of the mouth. So with regard to the midline, these cysts are differentially diagnosed as central and lateral cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, while with relation to the mylohyoid muscle they are differentially diagnosed as supra and inferior cysts of the mylohyoid muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 14\\]</u>. According to one point of view, lateral cysts are, in effect, central cysts which have undergone displacement due to the development of strong fibrous symphyses with the tissues of the midline. As far as another opinion is concerned, the lateral cysts constitute a separate entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【34】In histological terms, dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth are categorized according to Meyer’s classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, separating them into dermoid, epidermoid, and teratoid/teratomata cysts. Dermoid cysts have a wall of stratified squamous cornified epithelium and contain smegma and keratic scales as well as cutaneous appendages such as hair follicles, hairs, and sebaceous and sudoriparous glands. Epidermoid cysts have a wall of stratified squamous usually cornified epithelium and contain smegma and keratic scales without cutaneous appendages. Lastly, teratoid/teratomata cysts have a wall of stratified squamous epithelium with or without cornification and contain smegma and keratic scales as well as elements of the middle blastoderm such as vascular formations, elements of muscle and bone, dental tissues, or even whole teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. The latter type is the only variety that may have a malignant transformation. The clinical findings of these cysts cannot be differentially diagnosed.\n\n【35】Epidermoid cysts are less common than dermoid cysts in the head and neck region.\n\n【36】Most patients with these lesions ranged between the 2nd and 3rd decades of life. There is no predominant sex in the recent literature, regardless of some evidence which showed a male prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These cysts generally appear in the floor of the mouth, where there is a firm, usually painless, swelling, which sometimes raises the tongue. There are also symptoms of dysphagia and dysarthria and, when the lesions are quite large, dyspnea. A double-chin appearance is also common if the cyst develops below the mylohyoid muscle.\n\n【37】Depending on the position of its development and the size of the cyst, it either manifests itself as an augmentation in the submental area or as an augmentation in the floor of the mouth of a usually dough-like constitution and a double chin. In the case of a sizeable cyst, there is discomfort in chewing and in speech (croaking) or even in breathing, while in the event of infection there is rubor and pain in the area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9, 11, 14\\]</u>. The appearance of these cysts is most frequently reported in adults in their 20’ s and 30’ s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Of considerable assistance in the diagnosis of cysts in the floor of the mouth are the (ECHO) ultrasonic scan, the computed tomography (CT), the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the scintiscan of the area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 7\\]</u>. In the ultrasonic scan (ECHO), these cysts appear as infrasonic areas with ultrasonic elements; the computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging specify their size and anatomical relationship, while the scintiscan helps in their differential diagnosis from the ectopic thyroid tissue. The injection of endographine or lipiodol could assist in defining the boundaries and the size of the cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Nowadays, however, paracentesis of these cysts is usually avoided owing to their viscous content as well as the risk of their infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【39】The cysts in the floor of the mouth are differentially diagnosed with relation to a large number of diseases which occur in this area with similar symptomatology. Differential diagnosis should include developmental lesions, congenital, inflammatory, and salivary gland lesions, lymphomas, and benign tumors.\n\n【40】Developmental lesions are branchial cleft cyst, heterotopic gastrointestinal cysts, thyroglossal duct cysts, and ectopic thyroid tissue. Congenital masses include vascular malformations and lymphangiomas. Inflammatory accumulations are the Ludwig angina, cellulitis, and submandibular and sublingual space infections. Salivary gland deformities are ranula and the obstruction and dilation of the Wharton pore, cysts of the thyroid pore, pleomorphic adenoma, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Lymphomas are considerable in the area and coexist with lymphadenopathy. They are usually MALT lymphomas of low-grade extranodal B cells and often associated with autoimmune disease. Benign tumors are also rare and are of mesenchmal origin such as lipoma, schwannoma, and leiomyoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 13, 16\\]</u>. Needless to say, in all cases the conclusive confirmation of their diagnosis is effected via histopathological examination, as mentioned above 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Finally, the chosen treatment for cysts in the floor of the mouth is their total extraction (enucleation) via intraoral or extraoral approach or a combination of both, determined on each occasion by the location and size of the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6, 9, 14\\]</u>. There are no specific rules for treating these lesions because they are mainly congenital. When the symptoms include dysphagia and dyspnea, the doctor should guide the patient to undergo an operation. In most cases, the enucleation can be carried out intraorally, as clearly evident in a review of international bibliography, whereby in 194 cases of cysts of which 120 were surgically treated, 70 (58%) were done intraorally, 37 (31%) extraorally, and 13 (11%) via a combination of intra- and extraoral approaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 10\\]</u>. As regards location, out of 58 cases of sublingual approaches there are 5 reported cases of extraoral approach and 6 cases of combined approach; of 58 cases of submental approach, there are reports of 20 cases treated extraorally, 7 cases treated intraorally, and 2 treated with the combination of the intra- and extraoral approaches, while of 4 cases of submental approach, 3 cases were done via intraoral approach and 1 via extraoral approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【42】In our 2 case reports, Case  1 was treated via submental approach while Case  2 was done via intraoral approach. In Case  1, the surgical intervention yielded a dermoid cyst 6.5 cm long while in Case  2 it yielded a 5.4 cm long cyst. In both cases, the patients were observed for 2 years (at 6-month intervals) during which time there were no pathological findings. Prognosis is very good, and recurrence rate is very low and is usually related to bone remnant of the genial tubercles or of the hyoid bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【43】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【44】In conclusion, dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth are quite rare and need to be differentially diagnosed from several other diseases and conditions of the area. For their diagnosis, their clinical picture is essential involving a detailed examination of their size and anatomical location. Furthermore, invaluable assistance is provided by the ultrasonic scan, computed tomography, and scintiscan of the area. Their treatment calls for careful planning and execution of the surgical operation. The ultimate confirmation and definite diagnosis of the disease is always effected via histopathological examination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:49:16", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:55:21", "cost": 365.616}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:55:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:49:15"}

Metastatic bone disease represents a systemic pathology that heavily affects the quality of life of oncologic patients causing pain and functional disability. Methodology. We present the case of a patient with a history of renal cell cancer presenting pathologic fractures of both humeri and proximal right radius. Results. After a careful multidisciplinary approach, an adjuvant anticancer therapy and a photodynamic bone stabilization procedure were performed with a minimally invasive technique aiming to minimize pain and local disease progression, while restoring functional autonomy and improving the patient’s quality of life. Electrochemotherapy was delivered on the lytic bone lesions with extraskeletal involvement of the proximal left humerus and the proximal right radius, and then polymeric bone stabilization was performed on both humeri. At two months of follow-up, the patient presented satisfactory functional scores (MSTS score: 12/30 bilaterally; DASH scores: 46.7/100 for the right side and 48.3/100 for the left one), and pain was well controlled with opioid analgesics. Radiographs showed good results in terms of ossification of lytic bone lesions and durability of polymeric stabilization. At four months of follow-up, the patient reported a stable clinical scenario. Six months after surgery, due to extremely poor prognosis after the progression of primary disease, the patient was referred to palliative care and died shortly thereafter. Conclusion. Over the last decade, the management of metastatic bone disease has changed. Low-toxicity and minimally invasive procedures such as electrochemotherapy and polymeric bone stabilization might be performed concomitantly in selected patients, as an alternative to radiation therapy and to more demanding surgical procedures such as plating and adjuvant cementing.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The most common cause of destructive bone lesions is metastatic cancer. Bone is the third most common site for metastasis after lung and liver, while prostate, breast, lung, renal, and thyroid cancer account for around 80% of all skeletal metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Bone metastases are commonly associated with a high morbidity burden that heavily affects the quality of life of oncologic patients. Severe pain can be experienced due to bone pain and compression of spinal cord or nerve roots, and it requires adequate multidisciplinary treatment that can include narcotic analgesics, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bisphosphonate. Surgery is mainly indicated in nonresponding tumors or when pain is not controlled with medical treatment. Around 10–25% of patients present with an impending or actual pathologic fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, often requiring surgery and representing a catastrophic event for these patients. In addition to the fracture-related complications that could lead to immobilization, possible surgery, and consequent suspension of tumor-related treatments, other possible negative effects such as contamination of adjacent joint, soft tissue, nerves, and vessels by hematoma formation, or distant hematogenous dissemination due to microcirculation damages must be considered. Around 30% of the patients with renal cell cancer eventually develop bone metastases, and these are associated with worse overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Renal cancer bone metastases are usually lytic and highly hypervascular and cause technical issues especially during surgical management when the surgeon must face difficulties in achieving bone stability for pain control. Preoperative embolization is often required to minimize blood loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>, and whenever radical surgery is not indicated, minimally invasive palliative treatments, such as electrochemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, high intensity focus ultrasound, and photodynamic polymer bone stabilization, have become more and more popular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>.\n\n【4】At our institution, an Orthopedic Oncologic Department of a national reference center for musculoskeletal tumor surgery, the concomitant use of electrochemotherapy and a polymeric intramedullary stabilization system was chosen to treat multiple bone metastases of upper limbs in a multimetastatic renal cancer case.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A nonsmoker 60-year-old woman with a history of hiatal hernia with Barrett’s esophagus and depression was admitted to the Emergency Department due to persistent fever during the last month. Blood tests, ultrasounds (US), and computed tomography (CT) imaging showed an 8 cm right mesorenal cancer with infiltration of the perirenal fat, urinary collecting system, and renal sinus. Moreover, the presence of floating thrombus in the right renal vein up to the inferior caval vein was detected, while the absence of a cleavage plane with the lower face of the liver was reported. Radical right nephrectomy and homolateral renal vein thrombectomy were performed after 15 days from diagnosis. Histological examination revealed a pT3a G4 N1 clear cell renal cancer with extensive pleomorphic and rhabdoid aspects. A week after surgery, the patient suffered from left pulmonary thromboembolism, which required anticoagulant therapy. An acute pain at the left arm and right forearm occurred two months after surgery with no history of relevant trauma. Pathologic fractures were found in both the diaphysis of the left humerus and the proximal metaphysis of the right radius. The patient showed pain (NRS score 8/10 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>), swelling, and both upper limbs’ complete limitation of movement plus systemic fatigue and poor appetite. No fever was detected. The peripheral blood erythrocyte count was below 3 × 10<sup>12</sup>/L, and hemoglobin was around 95 g/L. The Karnofsky score was 30. After hospital admission, the patient received parenteral nutrition, analgesics, and other symptomatic treatments. Oral anticoagulant therapy was suspended and replaced with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) therapy. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, the patient was addressed for surgery. While undergoing the routine preoperative workups, a spontaneous diaphyseal fracture of the right humerus occurred. Preoperative radiographs 通用删除1(英):<u>(as in Figure 1)</u> demonstrated the fractures and wide lytic lesions involving the left humerus and the proximal right radius and confirmed the pathologic fracture of the right humerus. A CT scan of the thorax and abdomen was performed, and no secondary lesions were detected apart from the bone localizations. An additional CT scan of the upper limbs was performed to refine the surgical indication . Large osteolytic lesions with soft tissue invasion, involving the proximal left humerus and the proximal right radius were noticed. Our approach consisted of delivering a local adjuvant therapy on the lesions of the left humerus and right radius with electrochemotherapy using Cliniporator VITAE® technology (IGEA Spa; Carpi, MO, Italy). Thus, closed reduction and intramedullary fixation using a photodynamic polymeric stabilization system (IlluminOss® -IlluminOss Medical GmbH; Hilden, Germany) of both humeri was performed. The patient underwent general anesthesia and the entire procedure in a supine position. To treat both intraosseous and extraskeletal components of the lesions, electrochemotherapy was applied as follows: 4 and 7 single long (16 cm) needle VGD-1830T16 electrodes (variable geometry) with 1.8 mm in diameter and 3 cm active part were positioned around the right radial lesion and the left humeral lesion, respectively, and then the patient received a bolus of bleomycin (Bleomycin Nippon-Kayaku, Sanofi-Aventis, vials 15 mg, 15,000 UI/m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area). Eight minutes after the infusion, to allow the drug diffusion into the tumour tissues, electric pulses were applied (electroporation) according to the standard operating procedures. A single train of eight electric pulses of 100 µs of duration at 1000 V/cm was generated by the Cliniporator Vitae® (IGEA spa Carpi). Afterwards, a small incision was performed anterolaterally to the acromion process of the left scapula, the deltoid muscle was split longitudinally to expose the subdeltoid bursa, and then the supraspinatus tendon was incised in line with its fibers. The fracture was reduced with the aid of an intramedullary guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance and the canal prepared with flexible cannulated reamers. Thus, the Dacron® balloon catheter was inserted, and the monomer was infused. The light source was finally used to activate the monomer, the tissues were closed in layers, and the correct position of the implant was checked by fluoroscopy. When the stability of the left humerus was reached, the contralateral fracture was internally stabilized with the same photodynamic bone stabilization system. After the operation, the right arm was immobilized with a long splint for 20 days, while arm slings were positioned bilaterally. Passive mobilization was prescribed from the first day following the operation, active elevation of the arms was restricted for the first 20 days, while lifting and strength-training were prohibited for a period of six weeks. The postoperative period was complicated by anemia, and five blood units were given to the patient. The pain was controlled with the administration of oral oxycodone/naloxone 5 mg/2.5 mg combination every 12 hours. After oncological examination, 24 days after surgery, a systemic treatment with pazopanib 400 mg once a day was prescribed, and the patient was discharged to an outpatient rehabilitative long-term care ward. Two months following the operation, a clinical follow-up reported that all surgical scars were well healed, and the range of motion was acceptable for low-impact daily activities. Anterior elevation and abduction of both shoulders were around 90°, internal rotation was limited to the buttock, while the elbows demonstrated full range of motion bilaterally. While slight pain (NRS score 3/10) was reported during the mobilization of the left shoulder, no pain was evocable by palpation of the treated bone lesions or at rest (NRS score 0/10). Nonetheless, the patient continued the same opioid dosage as at hospital discharge. MSTS score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> was 12/30 (40%) bilaterally, while DASH scores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> were 46.7 and 48.3 for the right and left side, respectively. Along with the clinical examination, radiographs were performed  and showed no secondary mobilization of the implants, an initial callus formation, and new ossification processes. A radiographic partial response with a reduction of approximately 30% of the lesions’ diameters was reported (RECIST criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>). In conjunction with the oncologic team, the administration of pazopanib was confirmed, and a further clinical and radiological follow-up was scheduled at 6 months from surgery. At 4 months after surgery, the patient was contacted by telephone and reported substantial stability of the clinical scenario with well-controlled pain by mild opioid analgesics. At 6 months after surgery, a follow-up chest and abdomen CT exam detected lymph node infiltration of the caudate lobe of the liver and bone progression of disease. Furthermore, neck and supraclavicular lymph node metastases were reported. The oncologist suspended the treatment with pazopanib, and palliative care was initiated. The patient died within a month. This case report was approved by the United Ethical Committee of “AOU Città della Salute e della Scienza,” Turin, Italy, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The patient signed an informed consent form and authorized the use of data for research purposes.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Preoperative radiographs demonstrating simultaneous lytic lesions and pathologic fractures of upper limbs secondary to a renal cell cancer.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Preoperative CT scans demonstrating a large extraskeletal mass in the proximal left humerus causing a pathologic fracture, while a second lytic lesion is visible distally.

Discussion\n\n【12】The treatment of the multimetastatic patients has changed radically over the last 20 years: several surgical treatments have been introduced to control pain, maintain independent living, and improve the quality of life, along with improved medical treatments that target the prevention of tumor progression. Surgery is typically employed for impending fracture or for actual pathologic fractures, but when surgery is not indicated, fractionated radiation therapy (8 Gy/1f or 30 Gy/10f) is offered as first-line treatment. However, radiation therapy is not effective in around 30% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, and reaching of the maximum dose limits its usage. Moreover, patients might suffer from intolerance in the surrounding tissues and from weakening of the healthy bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient treated with internal fixation of pathologic fractures with an intramedullary polymeric stabilization system combined with simultaneous electrochemotherapy of upper limbs. The rationale was to apply adjuvant therapy to both the intraosseous and extraskeletal components to control tumor progression and pain, while providing immediate stability of the pathologic fractures with a minimally invasive surgical technique. In case of multimetastatic bone disease, the main objective of palliative treatments is to restore a partial/complete function controlling the pain and not always to reduce lesion size dimensions. Electrochemotherapy is based on the local intake of a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent (usually bleomycin) by means of electric pulses delivered to the tumor nodule via suitable sets of electrodes. Changes to the cell membrane potential determine the establishment of a transient passage: electroporation is induced, and water and charged molecules, such as some anticancer drugs, can pass through the cell membrane’s newly formed pores, into the cells’ interior. Such pores are established rapidly and disappear within minutes depending on the electric field amplitude 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In vivo studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–19\\]</u> demonstrated that, after exposure to the electric field, the tumor’s blood flow decreases up to 80% for about 24 hours allowing the cytotoxic agent to stay within the tumor for several hours and possibly determining a vascular-disrupting effect on the targeted cells. Electrochemotherapy’s range of applications is extensive and includes cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases, melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma, and liver and bone metastases; in addition, some clinical trials have been conducted on selected primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Even if the treatment of bone metastases and soft tissue masses with electroporation-based therapies is relatively recent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 21\\]</u>, good outcomes have been recorded in terms of pain control and tumor necrosis. A phase II clinical study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> conducted on 29 patients affected by painful bone metastatic disease showed an improvement on pain control or a decrease in analgesic consumption in 84% of the cases, while a local progression was detected in around 7% of the patients. No patient suffered from intolerance to bleomycin; local complications were rare accounting for skin ulceration and necrosis in previously irradiated skin and a neurogenic bladder after the third treatment in a large lesion involving the sacrum. Overall, electrochemotherapy is safe and feasible in well-selected patients with multimetastatic bone disease and provides good results on pain control and local disease progression. It also allows treating tumor masses and nodules in the proximity of noble structures such as vessels and nerves as the treatment does not employ tissue heating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Electrochemotherapy is currently in use at the referral centers for musculoskeletal surgery in Italy, while the Italian Society of Orthopedics and Traumatology (SIOT) has included it in the guidelines for the management of unresectable sacral tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Also, a registry named ReinBONE (Registry on Electrochemotherapy in Bone), which is promoted by the Study Group for Bone Metastasis of the SIOT, is at present collecting clinical data on the treated cases. The photodynamic bone stabilization system is a recent, minimally invasive surgical technique that allows surgeons to repair bone fractures using alight-curable polymer contained within an inflatable balloon catheter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. This technique allows the time to obtain a proper reduction of the fracture before hardening the polymer, unlike polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement: once correct alignment, rotational stability, and bone length have been restored, the visible light curing system is introduced to rapidly polymerize the liquid in the balloon to form a durable, hardened stabilizing rod. The ability of the system to get into contact with the cortical bone, filling the medullary space, significantly reduces the rotatory instability of the traditional intramedullary devices that require the use of further hardware, such as screws, to provide stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>. Also, if necessary, the hardened polymer can be used as a substrate for supplemental osteosynthesis as screws can be inserted as in conventional nails, to provide supplemental stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. A preliminary study reported no complications in the treatment of 36 osteoporotic and metastatic fractures of non-weight-bearing bones apart from one surgical revision of a humeral fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. To validate the initial studies, a European Union Registry has been set up: the first results reported achievement of procedural success, and no removal or revision of implants was required in 149 fractures treated with the polymeric rod 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Recently, a prospective study on 33 patients with traumatic humeral fractures treated with the polymeric rod showed a complete healing in the whole sample of patients, with good pain control and satisfying functional outcomes. The procedure’s complication rate was around 35% which is not higher than what was reported in literature for other stabilization systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. A comparison study among cemental plate fixation, intramedullary nailing, and photodynamic stabilization in the treatment of 105 malignant pathologic humeral fractures was conducted. No significant differences were registered in reoperation rates, but the rate of broken implants was significantly higher in patients treated with a polymeric rod 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Although the photodynamic polymer stabilization system is usually indicated for metastatic and osteoporotic fractures of non-weight-bearing bones fractures, several other uses are reported in the literature such as compassionate stabilization of femoral fractures in nonambulant patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> and surgical augmentation of acetabular and femoral fractures in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28, 29\\]</u>. Also, a preliminary study on sheep provided encouraging results in the treatment of weight-bearing bone fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. The system is contraindicated in active or not completely healed infections, even if studies have been carried out on the antimicrobial effect of the light used for the polymerization of the system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.\n\n【13】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【14】The management of a patient with a multimetastatic bone disease benefits a multidisciplinary approach. Whenever medical or radiation therapy is neither effective nor indicated, several palliative surgeries can be proposed to the patient. Minimally invasive and low-toxicity procedures such as bone electrochemotherapy and polymeric bone stabilization might be performed concomitantly in selected patients, in an attempt to synergize their benefits. Although clinical and functional outcomes of the above case report were satisfactory to improve the quality of life, further larger studies on combination of techniques could help surgeons make more conscious decisions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:03:26", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:04:18", "cost": 52.136}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:04:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:03:25"}

It is currently not routine practice to assess the functional response to these agents. However, concern over functional hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel has led to widespread uptake of prasugrel and ticagrelor as the default P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor after stent implantation in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Here we report, for the first time, 3 cases in which patients who have had ST exhibit hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Stent thrombosis (ST) is a major complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), occurring in 2.0–2.9% of patients within 22 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although uncommon, ST is associated with significant mortality of up to 45% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Dual antiplatelet therapy (APT) with aspirin and P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor has become the default strategy in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation to reduce the risk of ST. However, a cohort of patients may have an inadequate functional response to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u> and are more likely to sustain ischaemic events including ST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】There is particular concern about clopidogrel in this regard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. The established link between functional hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel and ischaemic events, including ST, in patients receiving coronary stents has triggered the development of more potent and faster-acting P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors. Two large randomised trials have demonstrated reduction in ischaemic endpoints for prasugrel and ticagrelor when compared to clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing PCI, albeit at the price of increased bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. In response to these data and earlier studies demonstrating quicker onset and more potent and more homogeneous responses of healthy volunteers and stable patients to prasugrel and ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel, many PCI centres in the UK have switched from clopidogrel to either prasugrel or ticagrelor as their default. Interestingly the incidence of prasugrel hyporesponsiveness is estimated to be 25% using flow cytometric analysis of intraplatelet vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation in ACS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In the CREST registry, out of 6 patients who were found to be hyporesponsive to prasugrel, only 3 responded adequately to ticagrelor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】We present for the first time 3 cases who had experienced definite ST after drug eluting stent (DES) implantation who demonstrated functional hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, using a previously well validated test, short thromboelastography (sTEG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–15\\]</u>. sTEG uses a novel parameter, percentage clotting inhibition (%CI) in the AA or ADP channel for clotting inhibition by aspirin or P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, respectively. The formula for %CI by aspirin is and for %CI by P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors is 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Threshold %CI of <50 in the AA channel and <30 in the ADP channel was used to define hyporesponsiveness to aspirin and P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, respectively.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】Patient 1 is a 74-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previous anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with a single drug eluting stent (DES) in the circumflex artery. He presented with proximal stent occlusion 2043 days after his index PCI while on aspirin 75 mg once daily. He was successfully treated with plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) and bare metal stent (BMS) insertion. Subsequently he underwent platelet function testing using sTEG. Initially our patient was started on aspirin 150 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. Forty-two days later, the assay revealed an adequate response to aspirin (%CI 71) but suboptimal response to clopidogrel (%CI 17). Therefore, prasugrel 5 mg daily was commenced as patient was borderline for age group with no initial loading. Once more the reading showed inadequate response to prasugrel 5 mg daily (%CI −7) after 63 days of treatment and the dose was uptitrated to 10 mg daily. Subsequent test, 105 days later, revealed suboptimal response again (%CI 9). As a result, the patient was commenced on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily without initial loading and retested after 85 days of treatment. Similarly, his reading revealed hyporesponse (%CI 1) . Due to development of dyspnoea while on ticagrelor, the patient was finally left on prasugrel 10 mg daily for life. After this episode, he was treated with cardiac resynchronisation therapy and defibrillation due to severe ischaemic cardiomyopathy but is currently alive, having suffered no further ST or other ischaemic events.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Short thromboelastography traces showing adequate response to aspirin 150 mg daily and hyporesponse to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors in first patient.

He represented with anterior STEMI due to ST 795 days after his index admission while on aspirin 75 mg daily. He was treated with intravascular ultrasound guided POBA. Platelet function testing using sTEG demonstrated an inadequate response to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor inhibitors. Initial response to aspirin 75 mg daily appeared adequate (%CI 61); however response to clopidogrel 75 mg daily was suboptimal (%CI 21) after 36 days of treatment. As a result, the patient was commenced on prasugrel 10 mg daily with no initial loading. Testing, after 70 days of treatment, again revealed hyporesponsiveness (%CI 17). Finally, ticagrelor 90 mg bd was introduced, with no initial loading, with similar effect (%CI −21) after 263 days of treatment . Ultimately, he was maintained on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for life and has suffered no further ST or ischaemic events to date.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Short thromboelastography traces showing adequate response to aspirin 75 mg daily and hyporesponse to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors in second patient.

He represented 671 days later with ST while on aspirin 150 mg daily. Both vessels required treatment due to acute thrombotic occlusion and four further DES were implanted. He was proven to have adequate response to aspirin 150 mg daily (%CI 82) but suboptimal response to thienopyridines. Clopidogrel 75 mg with inadequate response (%CI 8) after 19 days of treatment was replaced by prasugrel 10 mg daily with no initial loading, with again suboptimal response (%CI 9) after 56 days of usage. Finally, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily was commenced without initial loading but similarly was proven to have inadequate response (%CI 24) after 21 days of treatment. As response to ticagrelor was better than to prasugrel, the decision was made for him to remain on ticagrelor for 12 months.

Discussion\n\n【15】Our case series demonstrates three cases of patients with acute stent thrombosis who were found to be hyporesponsive to all three commonly available P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a series of such cases has been described. Two previously published case reports have illustrated patients with dual thienopyridine resistance to clopidogrel and prasugrel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. In both cases, the patient was subsequently shown to have an adequate response to the ticagrelor. Orban et al. suggested that the response to ticagrelor may be due to its properties as an active drug, compared with prasugrel and clopidogrel which are prodrugs requiring hepatic cytochrome bioactivation prior to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Based upon both early studies reporting superior potency, speed of onset and consistency of responses to prasugrel and ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in both volunteers and stable patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>, and subsequent large scale randomised trials, in many PCI centres, prasugrel and ticagrelor have become the default P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> agent. The assumption from some interventionalists is that prasugrel and ticagrelor are not associated with functional hyporesponsiveness (also known as “resistance”). However, recent data suggest that functional resistance does indeed occur in association with these agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Our case series describe for the first time the concept of functional resistance to all three commonly available P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors. These data were obtained using short TEG, a well described and validated modification of TEG platelet mapping assay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–13\\]</u>. Our group has previously described the reproducibility of sTEG and has demonstrated the value of comparing the ADP-induced clotting response to that achieved using kaolin stimulation. This method has the advantage that there is a built-in reference, both numerical and visual, of the strength of the clot in response to ADP compared to the maximum clot strength achieved by kaolin. We have also used sTEG to describe discrepancies between these results from Verify Now assay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>.\n\n【18】One limitation of our case series is that we were not able to objectively prove patients’ compliance with medications, although we appreciate that it might have implications on final management strategy. In addition to this, no other platelet function assays (i.e. Verify Now) were used to confirm our results.\n\n【19】These cases suggest that some patients experiencing ST may exhibit functional resistance to all 3 of the currently available oral P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors. As well as adding weight to the argument in favour of measuring individual responses to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, with the intention of possibly avoiding stents in patients who do not respond to them, it also raises interesting questions about the mechanism of hyporesponsiveness.\n\n【20】Further data are required to investigate whether this observation in such patients could be due to a paucity of receptor numbers, a functional flaw in the receptor activation, or perhaps even a lack of availability of such drugs at the receptor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:55:24", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:59:18", "cost": 233.509}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:59:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:55:24"}

Hydatid disease is a disease caused by the cestode Echinococcus. Echinococcus granulosus is the most common Echinococcus species affecting human. It may affect any organ and tissue in the body, most in the liver and lung. Disease is endemic in some regions of the world, and is common in Iran. Primary hydatid cyst of the axillary region is an unusual and rare localization of hydatid disease. So far, only sixteen cases have been published in the all medical literature. Case Report. Herein, we present a 33-year-old woman because of a mass in the axillary region of four months duration. Axillary ultrasonography showed a thick wall cystic lesion. No abnormality was found in mammographic examination of either breast, or in abdominal ultrasonography and chest X-ray. The mass was excised for pathological examination that showed a typical laminated membrane of hydatid cyst. Postoperative IgG- ELISA serology in this case was negative. Based on pathology an axillary hydatid cyst was diagnosed. Conclusion. Hydatid cyst should be considered in endemic areas in patients presenting with a soft tissue mass in the axillary region.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In human, three forms of echinococcosis are known to occur: cystic echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, alveolar echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, and polycystic Echinococcosis due to Echinococcus vogeli or Echinococcus oligarthrus. Hydatid disease is a parasitic disease usually caused by the larval stage of a small zoonotic tapeworm primarily found in dogs Echinococcus granulosus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Echinococcus granulosus (cystic echinococcosis) is the most common species, E. granulosus has worldwide distribution and is endemic in many countries, especially the Mediterranean region, Australia, South America, the Middle East, South Africa, and Eastern Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Iran is also an endemic area for hydatid diseases, the prevalence of cystic echinococcosis in humans detected by ultrasound ranges from less than 0.5% to 1.5%. Human seropositivity was greater than 5% in the west and southwest of the Islamic Republic of Iran, with 2–18% seroprevalence in nomadic groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. The hydatid cysts of E. granulosus tend to form in the liver (50% to 70% of patients) or lung (20% to 30%) but may through the capillary systems reaches the general circulation and passes to all viscera and soft tissues. For this reason, hydatid cysts may arise in atypical sites such as the brain, heart, orbit, urinary bladder, chest wall, subcutaneous tissue, tibia, parotid gland, breast, cervicofacial region, thyroid, and in any organ of the body (10%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 6, 7\\]</u>. The diagnostic methods include imaging techniques, mainly X-ray for lung echinococcosis, ultrasound and computed tomography examination for abdominal echinococcosis and other affected organs, and immunodiagnostic tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IFAT, and immunoblot) for confirmation. IgG-ELISA is about 90% sensitive for liver cyst infection but less sensitive for lung (80%) or other organ involvementand (90%), and its specificity is 90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Symptoms are often absent, and in many cases infection is detected only incidentally by imaging studies. Its symptoms depending on the host organ, location, its effect on adjacent structures, complications due to rupture, secondary infections, and immunological reactions caused by the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5\\]</u>. Primary axillary hydatid disease is rare even in the endemic regions, we could find only sixteen case reports in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6, 8–21\\]</u>. In this paper, we report a case of a primary hydatid disease which originated in the subcutaneous tissue in the right axillary region in a 36-year-old woman.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 33-year-old woman in 2010 was presented to our hospital with painless right axillar swelling of four-month duration. She had no history of breast mass, fever, other symptoms, or other mass, and also had no history of hydatid cyst. On physical examination, a firm to hard  cm mobile mass was noted in the right axilla. Laboratory investigations were done which revealed normal blood counts and biochemical result. Ultrasound showed a  cm thick wall cystic lesion comparable with type CE1 of WHO classification . No abnormality was found in mammographic examination of either breast. In this case it was difficult to differentiate a cyst with uncharacteristic imaging findings (type CE1 of WHO Classification based on ultrasound) from simple subcutaneous cyst, haematoma, necrotic tumor, or lymph node based on ultrasound. Under general anesthesia, the entire cyst was excised without rupture and sent for histopathological examination. On macroscopic examination, a unilocular cyst with a hard fibrotic wall was seen. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of a typical laminated membrane of hydatid cyst . The hydatid IgG-ELISA test in our case was negative. Radiographs of chest, spine, and long bones were done for evaluation of hydatid in organs and all were normal. Abdominal ultrasound examination was normal. The patient was discharged from the hospital with albendazole 400 mg twice a day for four weeks. During one-year followup, examinations since her surgery have shown no relapse of hydatidosis.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Ultrasound image of axillary cyst. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Section of cyst wall showing germinal epithelium and underlying laminated membrane (haematoxylin-eosin stain, magnification ×10). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Hydatid disease is a common clinical pathology in many parts of the world. The main species pathogenic for humans in Mediterranean and Southern European countries is Echinococcus granulosus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Hydatid cysts most often develop in the liver and lung. primary axillary hydatid disease is rare, as shown in Table 1, we could find only sixteen previous case reports in the medical literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6, 8–21\\]</u> .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Reported cases of hydatid cysts of the axilla.</u>\n\n【12】Hydatid cysts grow 5 to 10 cm in size within the first year and can survive for years or even decades. The cyst may be present for many years in the organ in which it is located with no clinical symptoms or signs, and sometimes it may exhibit clinical symptoms depending on the size and location of the cyst and the pressure of the growing cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. The sonographic and tomographic appearances of subcutaneous hydatid disease such as axillary hydatid cyst are similar to those in other organs. Hydatid cyst may be unilocular at earlier stages, whereas older cysts are usually multilocular. They may either be made up of daughter cysts or have a solid appearance made up of multiple septated cysts. However, hyperintense hydatid cysts in the axillary region can be misdiagnosed as a soft tissue tumor or lymphadenopathy. As Iran is an endemic area for hydatid disease, this should be in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with tissue masses including haematoma, abscess, sarcoma, lymphadenopathy, breast cancer, or metastatic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 18\\]</u>. Infection is suspected based on imaging studies (ultrasonography, CT, and MRI), and it may be confirmed by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot serology. Ultrasonography is an easy available, and affordable with high diagnostic sensitivity imaging test for screening of hydatid cyst in endemic areas and in family members based on WHO classification. The sonographic imaging in our case showed a simple cystic lesion comparable with type CE1 of WHO Classification and did not confirm a diagnosis of hydatid cyst; it is difficult to differentiate a cyst with uncharacteristic imaging findings from simple subcutaneous cyst, haematoma, necrotic tumor, or lymph node based on ultrasound. Immunodiagnostic tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IFAT, and immunoblot) are used for confirmation. IgG-ELISA is about 90% sensitive for liver cyst infection but less sensitive for lung (80%) and other organ involvement (90%), and its specificity is 90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Postoperative IgG-ELISA test in this case was negative. Abdominal ultrasonography and a plain chest radiography are mandatory to detect liver and lung involvement. Chest X-rays and imaging studies showed no other involvement in our patient. In routine practice, the accurate diagnosis in patient with soft tissue hydatidosis is frequently delayed until histopathologic examination after surgery. In this case, for accurate diagnosis, the entire cyst was excised.\n\n【13】Today, treatment options for CE (cystic echinococcosis) include surgery, PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration), and chemotherapy. Optimal treatment of hydatid cysts is surgical resection to remove the cyst. The main purpose of the surgery is to prevent the patient from complications such as compression of surrounding structures, infection or rupture of the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. Total cystectomy with fibrous adventitia which allows removal of all parasitic elements without spillage of the contents of the cyst, is curative treatment for soft tissue hydatidosis. We performed total cystectomy without rupture in spite of the anatomical distortion of the axillary region. Antiparasitic medication is widely used postoperatively and preoperatively for the purpose of cyst size reduction and to limit the risk of intraoperative dissemination of daughter cysts. All patients are treated with albendazole 10 mg/kg/day for at least two weeks preoperatively, and this is continued postoperatively for four weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. However, the experience with scolicidal agents such as albendazole (400 mg/kg) and praziquantel (50 mg/kg) or a combination of these drugs in the treatment of soft tissue hydatid disease is very limited and results of the medical treatment in the hydatidosis are unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. We gave the patient albendazole 400 mg twice a day for four weeks postoperatively.\n\n【14】In conclusion, hydatid disease is a widespread public health problem in developing countries especially in endemic regions; therefore, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a palpable mass in the axillary region.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:32:02", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:32:10", "cost": 7.17}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:32:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:32:00"}

This study quantified with Gait Analysis (GA) the gait pattern of a 4-year-old diplegic child with calf contracture before, 5 days, and 3 months after BTA injections into gastrocnemius. Kinematic and kinetic data of main lower limb joints were investigated. After only 5 days, ankle dorsi-plantarflexion and knee flex-extension improved, but hip joint worsened, increasing its excessive flexion, to compensate the improvement in knee position of the treated limb and to obtain better stability. A worsening of hip power happened. After 3 months, all joints generally improved their position during gait cycle. Hip and knee joints increased their range of movement and improvements occurred at ankle kinematics and kinetisc, too; a better ankle position and an increase of its capacity of propulsion during terminal stance were evident.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The use of Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) has been recommended in the management of spasticity in ambulant children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) to improve function and to delay the development of fixed deformity and the need for surgical intervention. Although its immediate positive effects have been quantified using Gait Analysis (GA) in previous studies, especially for the treatment of calf contracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>, some limits emerged. First, in literature the evaluation of gait changes after BTA injections for reducing gastrocnemius contracture was focused only on joints directly connected to gastrocnemius (knee and ankle joints); concerning proximal joints (pelvis and hip joints) no analyses were found. Then, all the studies quantifying both kinematic and kinetic strategies were conducted only on patients older than 6 years; few studies, in fact, investigated gait pattern of younger children using GA, and in these analyses only kinematics was evaluated, neglecting kinetic data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>. It is important to underline that no study evaluated the effects of the treatment few days after it, too; the evaluations were generally conducted one or more months after the treatment.\n\n【4】This study quantified with GA the effects of BTA injections into gastrocnemius for the reduction of excessive knee flexion due to calf spasticity in a 4-yr-old child with CP. His gait was evaluated considering distal and proximal joints and in term of kinematics, and kinetic data, too. He was examined before, 5 days, and 3 months after BTA injections into left gastrocnemius. In this way a complete quantification of motor strategy of a very young patient was conducted.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient was a 4-yr-old male (weight: 16 Kg; height: 103 cm) affected by spastic diplegia; he was born approximately 7 weeks preterm with respiratory distress. He showed a dynamic calf contracture and a stiffness of adductor muscles; the left side was more worsened than the right one. He was an independent community ambulator without the use of assistive devices or orthoses.\n\n【7】The patient was injected 2 times, and in each inoculation BTA (Botox, Allergan, USA) was injected intramuscularly in the same muscles and with the same dosage: in the left medial gastrocnemius (20 U) and in the left lateral gastrocnemius (15 U). The temporal distance between the two inoculations was 10 months. No side effects or complications following injections were found. He was examined before (PRE session) and 5 days (POST1 session) after the first BTA injection and 3 months (POST2) after the second BTA injection.\n\n【8】The patient was evaluated with 3D GA, using a 12-camera optoelectronic system (ELITE2002, BTS S.p.A. Milan, Italy) with passive markers positioned according to Davis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, for kinematic movement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, two force platforms (Kistler, CH), for kinetic movement , and a synchronic video system (BTS S.p.A. Milan, Italy). Seven trials were collected for each session for the repeatability of the results. Some parameters were identified and calculated from kinematic and kinetic data: spatiotemporal parameters, angles joint values in specific gait cycle instant, and peak values of joint powers. The mean values (standard deviation) of kinematic and kinetic parameters are detailed, respectively, in Tables 1 and 2, in PRE, POSTs sessions, and for normative range (CG).\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of kinematic parameters (mean and standard deviation) for analysed patient (CP patient; right and left side) in the examined sessions and normative data (Control Group, CG).

Pre Session\n\n【12】Child walked with a low velocity of progression (  m/sec; CG:  m/sec) and limited anterior step length (right:  m and left:  m; CG:  m), if compared to normative values. Pelvic tilt was closed to normality. His gait was characterised by excessive left hip flexion at initial contact, while right side was closed to normality; a reduced range of motion was evident bilaterally, due to a limited extension in midstance. Knee was characterised by abnormal flexion during stance, due to spasticity of gastrocnemius, showing a limited range of motion bilaterally. Ankle joint was dorsiflexed during all gait cycle, and the right side was the most compromised. Right foot was in a correct position in the transversal plane, while left foot was intrarotated during all gait cycle. Concern kinetic data, a limited capacity of ankle propulsion during terminal stance and a reduced peak of hip power generation during stance phase were found bilaterally.\n\n【13】##### 2.2. POST1 Session (5 Days After the First Injection)\n\n【14】Velocity of progression improved (  m/sec), while the other spatiotemporal parameters were unchanged. Pelvic tilt was in anterior position bilaterally and hip increased its flexion on right side, while left one improved its extension in midstance, remaining above normality. Right knee joint did not change significantly, while the left side improved its position in stance. The treatment reduced ankle dorsiflexion at right side while left one remained generally unchanged. There is a persistent drop foot in swing phase bilaterally, since ankle joints were not able to achieve dorsiflexion. Both feet were more intrarotated than PRE session. Concerning kinetic data, a reduction of power generation at left ankle during terminal stance occurred; hip power showed higher values of positive peak in stance phase bilaterally.\n\n【15】##### 2.3. POST2 Session (3 Months After the Second Injection)\n\n【16】hip joint reduced its excessive flexion at initial contact on right side, remaining above normality, and improved its extension in mid-stance bilaterally, with consequently a better excursion during movement. Knee showed a more physiological position during stance phase with better range of motion. Ankle reduced its excessive dorsiflexion bilaterally. The right side was closed to normality during stance phase, and the left side showed, in addiction, the worsening of ankle dorsiflexion in swing phase. Foot progression improved bilaterally. Concern kinetics, hip power improved at right side, and maximum of ankle power increased bilaterally.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】In this study the kinematic and kinetic aspects of gait in a 4-yr-old child with CP were evaluated using GA to quantify the effects of BTA injection into gastrocnemius for the reduction of excessive knee flexion due to calf spasticity. Literature investigated widely this topic but it presents some limits: only the effects on ankle and knee pattern were evaluated and those on proximal joints, as hip and pelvic joints, were neglected. Then, patients were generally more than 6-yr-old; few studies investigated gait strategy in younger children using GA, but these analyses concerned only kinematics, not kinetic data. In addition, the evaluations were conducted generally one or more months after the treatment.\n\n【19】The results of this study demonstrated that the brief term effects of BTA occurred on all joints of lower limbs, not only on joints directly connected to treated gastrocnemius, knee, and ankle joints. Concerning pelvic joint, a worsening happened in the sagittal plane, increasing the anterior tilt; hip increased its flexion and this condition was directly connected to abnormal pelvic tilt position. The higher hip flexion at initial contact and the reduction of excessive knee flexion during stance phase on the treated side induced a new biomechanical position: this condition may be directly connected to the initial reduction of gastrocnemius spasticity that allows the subject to experience greater extension of left knee. At ankle joint some significant improvements occurred in the sagittal plane, while on coronal plane, the treatment caused a worsening in foot progression bilaterally. The excessive hip flexion and foot intrarotation may be a strategy to obtain a better stability and equilibrium. As knee joint has a more physiological pattern on the treated side, while the right side maintained its excessive flexion, this strategy probably is a scheme that permits to walk the patient with safety and at higher velocity of progression. In term of kinetics, before the treatment, the spastic gastrocnemius induced a reduction of ankle power generation at terminal stance, because this muscle is not able to strongly contract in this phase; after injection no changes occurred. This result was connected to the nature of BTA that denervates and produces a temporary paralysis of the treated muscle. The worsening of positive hip power in stance may be related to the high hip flexion at initial contact and to the reduced ankle power generation at terminal stance, too: the low levels of ankle work resulted in greater amounts of work being done by muscle groups of the hip.\n\n【20】Three months after the second injection of BTA, gait pattern revealed a general improvement, both at proximal and distal joints. Hip reduced its abnormal flexion at initial contact on right side and revealed an improvement in hip extension in mid-stance bilaterally. A better position and a good excursion of knee during all gait cycle bilaterally were evident. In this way a reduction of knee asymmetry, present in POST1 session, disappeared, allowing the subject to show more physiological knee flexion during most of gait cycle: a knee flexion reduction and a better extension would facilitate a corresponding increase of hip extension, to maintain erect posture during gait. Ankle improved its position during all stance phase; in swing phase instead the range of motion remained low. Even if the treatment reduced the dominance of the ankle plantarflexors over the antagonist muscles and so tibialis anterior is not contrasted by the abnormal gastrocnemius activity any more, probably the dorsiflexor muscle is again weak avoiding the correct position of ankle joint during swing. Concern kinetic results, a better capacity of propulsion at ankle joint is evident : the improvement may be due to the conclusion of temporary paralysis of treated muscle that now can contract during terminal stance. Hip power reduced on the right side its maximum in stance phase, according to decrease of hip flexion.\n\n【21】From these results, it is evident that BTA represents an encouraging therapy for the reduction of spasticity in CP subjects. In particular this study demonstrated that the treatment performed on a very young patient has significant effects immediately few days after the treatment. These modifications, that were worsening at proximal joints and improvements at distal ones, may be due to the search of a new control strategy immediately required after the reduction of gastrocnemius spasticity: the modifications at distal joints, directly connected to treatment of gastrocnemius, probably induce postural adjustments at proximal joints. Some months after the second inoculation, gait pattern revealed a general improvement, both at proximal and distal joints, demonstrating the reaching of better stability and reorganization of motor scheme of the patient. These significant changes may be directly connected to the effects of the BTA inoculation into the spastic muscles and to the natural maturation of the gait in the patient, too: the reduction of the spasticity during the growth period may reduce muscle tone and allow normal longitudinal muscle growth and lengthening leading to a more physiological gait pattern. Future studies might be conducted to compare children with the same age treated and not treated with BTA, in order to exclude one effect (the natural maturation of gait) with respect to the other (effects of BTA).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:53:02", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:53:56", "cost": 54.358}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:53:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:53:00"}

Case Reports\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Case  1\n\n【6】A 52-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room because of a headache, fever (39°C), alternating with hypothermia, confusion, and weakness in the left leg. The patient also reported diarrhea, loss of appetite, and weight loss of 12 kilograms in the past three months. He had been diagnosed with HIV infection a few days before his admission. He denied previous diseases, using continuous medication, and previous hospital admissions or surgeries.\n\n【7】At the physical examination, the patient presented a regular status with confusion, isochoric and photoreactive pupils, and no signs of meningeal irritation, but a loss of force in the left leg. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed an area of hypodensity in the white matter on the upper convexity of the right frontal lobe. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a hypersignal in T2 on the upper and lower right frontal gyri, in the left occipital lobe, and lesions with ring enhancement in the deep upper left temporal sulcus . Laboratory exams showed a lymphocyte CD4 count of 94 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and HIV viral load of 479,365 copies ml. A reactive serological test for syphilis showed a titer 1 : 8, which was previously treated with penicillin G benzathine. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 3 leucocytes/mm3, proteins of 28 mg/dL, and glucose of 39 mg/dL. CSF cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. PCR testing for JCPyV virus was negative. However, PCR testing for BKPyV was positive. Detection of BKPyV consisted of a semi-nested PCR with two 20-base oligomer primers (PEP-1 and PEP-2) followed by second round PCR with 40-nucleotide sequence (BEP-1 and PEP-1), as previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The length of the BKPyV targeted for amplification was 176 nucleotide pairs. At this same hospitalization, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, and a regime of rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid was provided. The patient was started on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, he presented signs of sepsis of unknown origin twenty days after the admission and died three days later.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 A magnetic resonance image showed a hyperintensity in T2 on the upper and lower right frontal gyri, in the left occipital lobe, and lesions with annular enhancement in the deep upper left temporal sulcus (case report 1).</u>\n\n【9】##### 2.2. Case  2\n\n【10】A 45-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of headaches, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, dyspnea, loss of appetite, and fever. She had been diagnosed with HIV infection one month before. The patient was taking sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine due to a presumptive diagnosis of neurotoxoplasmosis in a previous recent hospitalization. On the physical examination, the patient was lethargic, with pain at palpation. She presented a severe immunosuppression with a CD4-T lymphocyte count of 23 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and a viral load of 167,580 copies/ml. Cerebral MRI showed mild volume loss with scattered FLAIR hyperintensities and asymmetric lesions without mass effect . The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed 8 leucocytes/mm3, protein 133 mg/dL, and glucose 40 mg/dl. Cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were negative. PCR testing for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, herpes zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and JC virus was negative. However, the sample was positive for the presence of BKPyV and cytomegalovirus. She continued to receive empiric treatment for neurotoxoplasmosis. During the hospitalization, she presented impaired renal function, which was attributed to sulfadiazine. It was also considered the hypothesis of BK renal infection, reinforced by a positive PCR testing for BKPYV in the urine. The patient was started on HAART (zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz).

However, BKPyV has been detected in asymptomatic apparently healthy and immunocompetent individuals, with self-limited clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. To date, since the first report of BKPyV associated neurological infection almost 20 years ago, only eight cases have been described in patients with AIDS  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14–22\\]</u>. As observed in our two patients, the most common symptom is a headache. Other signs of neurological impairment include seizures, progressive mental deterioration, dysarthria, hallucinations, visual disturbances, and in one case paraplegia. BKPyV retinitis has been described in AIDS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Imaging of CNS infection by BKPyV is characterized by a preferential involvement of the periventricular and pial surfaces of the brain parenchyma. In fact, magnetic resonance imaging of the cases of BKPyV meningoencephalitis has shown areas of increased signal intensity of the periventricular white matter of brain while the cortex is generally spared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9\\]</u>. Meningeal contrast enhancement along with increased meningeal thickness also occurs when infection spread to meningitis is present. Deep white matter of the cerebellum is generally spared while deep gray matter structures are compromised. As shown in Table 1, the diagnosis of BKPyV encephalitis has usually been established by PCR testing of the CSF in the majority of the patients and sometimes complemented or not by BKPyV PCR of the brain biopsy specimen. The lack of demonstration of the virus in the brain tissue sample has been frequently observed in the reported cases, either by immunohistochemistry or by in situ hybridization. If a patient shows neurological symptoms without a positive serology and PCR for other pathogens (namely, viral agents such as JCV, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus), while a positive PCR for BKPyV is present in the CSF/brain tissue, it strongly favors the diagnosis of a BKPyV meningoencephalitis.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Characteristics of HIV-infected patients with BKV encephalitis.</u>\n\n【15】There is no established treatment of BKPyV infection.

However, the effectiveness of these agents is doubtful and some of them can cause severe side effects. However, in the few reported cases of BKPyV encephalitis, therapy has been restricted to the use of antiretroviral therapy. Consequently, overall mortality of the reported cases has been high, 70% of the reported cases in the literature. In summary, BKPyV meningoencephalitis is an emerging disease in HIV-infected patients. Physicians should be aware to recognize the main clinical features and diagnose BKPyV meningoencephalitis.

It is typically characterized by the triad of altered mental status, vertical gaze paralysis, and memory impairment, although their symptoms can be highly variable. We describe the case of a young man who came to the emergency department presenting diplopia, speech alteration, and decreased level of consciousness with frequent fluctuations. Baseline computerized tomography was normal, and because of the clinical findings, thrombolysis was performed. Subsequently made magnetic resonance showed a bilateral acute thalamic infarction caused by an obstruction of the Percheron artery. Although Percheron syndrome has been previously described in medical journals, our case is an unusual case in which we could perform an acute intravenous thrombolytic treatment.

Introduction\n\n【3】Thalamic vascularization is complex and varies from person to person. The paramedian or Percheron artery is a rare variant where a single thalamoperforant artery supplies both thalamic nuclei, with variable midbrain irrigation. Bilateral thalamic infarcts are rare, occurring in 0.6% of ischemic strokes and between 4 and 18% of all thalamic infarcts. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】This type of stroke is related to embolic phenomena, and cardioembolism should always be considered as part of its etiology, as well as the discovery of some congenital defects not known previously objectified. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】It is characterized by decreased consciousness, neuropsychological and memory impairment, and vertical gaze palsy.

The study was completed with the performance of computerized angiography that revealed a bilateral thalamic hypodensity predominantly in the posterior left thalamus (bitalamic infarction, probably Percheron) which was confirmed with the performance of magnetic resonance imaging , where a bilateral acute thalamic infarction compatible with Percheron syndrome is finally observed, appreciating hemorrhagic transformation in the left thalamus.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Magnetic resonance imaging where a bilateral acute thalamic infarction compatible with Percheron syndrome is observed appreciating hemorrhagic transformation in the left thalamus.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Magnetic resonance imaging where we can observe hemorrhagic transformation in the left thalamus of the infarction.</u>\n\n【15】Due to the persistence of the alteration in the level of consciousness, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for neurological control.

Discussion\n\n【18】The artery of Percheron (AOP) is a rare variant of the paramedian arterial supply in which a single dominant thalamoperforating artery nourishes both the paramedian thalamus and, in some cases, the rostral midbrain. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Bilateral thalamic infarcts are rare, occurring in 0.6% of ischemic strokes and between 4 and 18% of all thalamic infarcts. They are typically characterized by the triad of altered mental status, vertical gaze paralysis, and memory impairment, although their symptoms can be highly variable, including aphasia, amnesia, and hypersomnolence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, as happened in our patient, where the fluctuation in the level of consciousness and diplopia were present from the beginning. Furthermore, our patient presented right hemiparesis. As we have seen in some publications such as Arauz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, motor paresis has been described as a frequent symptom and it may be explained by the cortical spinal tract impairment at the midbrain level.\n\n【20】Occlusion of the AOP is not the only condition that can be found in thalamic lesions. We want to highlight the importance of framing a syndrome within the differential diagnosis of altered level of consciousness in young people, among which we find other vascular etiologies such as basilar syndrome and deep cerebral venous thrombosis; pathologies such as Wernicke’s encephalopathy, neoplasms, infections, Wilson’s disease, osmotic myelinolysis, toxic and metabolic processes, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>; which we exclude based on symptoms and above all thanks to the neuroimaging findings.\n\n【21】AOP infarction is an often delayed diagnosis due to various factors. First is a syndrome that is unknown to many emergency physicians due to its rarity, and next, the ultimate diagnosis is typically by magnetic resonance imaging in the hospital course. When we suspect an infarction in the territory of the posterior circulation, it is of vital importance performing a cerebral computerized axial tomography (CT) imaging to exclude hemorrhagic processes and enable adequate treatment with intravenous thrombolysis. Early identification of basilar artery occlusion may allow recanalisation and reperfusion via intravenous and/or intra-arterial thrombolysis. As far as we know, our case is the second case reported along with the one reported by Caruso et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, in which we were able to perform an acute intravenous thrombolysis, often not available because of the delay in the diagnosis. Kostanian and Cramer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> also reported a case in which they performed acute endovascular thrombolytic therapy for the AOP occlusion that showed clinical and imaging improvement after 24 hours.\n\n【22】Patients have frequently missed the time window for acute management of ischemic stroke, most of the times because of the absence of alterations in the baseline imaging and authors reported a low sensitivity of angiographic study, being brain magnetic resonance the most specific imaging test for diagnosis, often based on clinical suspicion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】In conclusion, AOP is an uncommon entity of coma in young patients, being of vital importance for emergency physicians to keep it in the differential diagnosis of coma and altered mental status in young people, in order to exclude other vascular etiologies and metabolic diseases and to establish a treatment for a favorable neurologic outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:14:03", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:15:16", "cost": 72.66}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:35", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:15:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:14:03"}

It was subsequently found that the SFT had metastasized to the brain by additional pathology, and not the predicted adenocarcinoma. SFTs are a rare mesenchymal neoplasm that accounts for less than 2% of all reported soft tissue tumors. SFTs most commonly arise in the thoracic cavity, but are frequently found in various locations throughout the body, and rarely metastasize to the brain. This case highlights that rare neoplasms, such as SFT, should not be ruled out as a potential cause of metastasis. Due to the rarity of this clinical situation, we also provide a review and discussion of previously reported SFT cases and the use of postoperative radiation therapy. The optimal treatment for individual patients remains unclear in this unique situation. Surgical resection followed by adjuvant Gamma Knife radiation therapy to the surgical bed appears to be a safe option for local treatment of SFT in select patients.

Case Report\n\n【6】The patient is a 70-year-old male Navy veteran who served on the Mekong in Vietnam for 14 months, during which time he reports that he was exposed to Agent Orange. He has a previous history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass grafting in 2015, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from tobacco.\n\n【7】He presented with progressive shortness of breath and underwent a workup with CT scan of the chest without contrast, which revealed two distinct appearing tumors, one in the right upper lobe with a tumor size of 1.5 cm and another in the right lower lung with a tumor size of 13 cm . He underwent a right upper lobe wedge resection and a right lower lobectomy for these tumors. Pathology revealed two distinct neoplasms. The right upper lobe tumor was a moderately differentiated lung adenocarcinoma, stage pT2a . Pathology revealed focal invasion of the visceral pleura, confirmed by elastic stain.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Noncontrast CT chest, coronal view. Visible is a 1.5 cm tumor mass in the right upper lobe of the lung.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Noncontrast CT chest, coronal view.

Tumor shows an acinar growth pattern.</u>\n\n【11】The pathology of the right lower lobe tumor was a SFT. This tumor showed a fascicular pattern of spindled cells with elongated nuclei . The mitotic rate was significantly elevated at 13 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields . Multiple fields of necrosis were also identified. Immunohistochemical stains were performed, which revealed reactivity for CD34 and Bcl-2. The tumor was negative for pancytokeratin. This tumor did not extend beyond the lung parenchyma. A routine sampling of the right lower paratracheal (4R), subcarinal 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>, paraesophageal 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u>, and right hilar (10R) lymph nodes was negative for metastatic disease from either tumor. The surgical margins were negative for tumor in both cases. Thus, no additional therapy was recommended at that time. He was followed with clinical visits and imaging studies.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Hematoxylin and Eosin, low-power 100x view of solitary fibrous tumor.

However, a restaging CT chest with contrast showed multiple new pulmonary tumors. Shortly after this CT scan was performed, he presented with mild right leg weakness. MRI of the brain showed a solitary 2.5 cm enhancing mass of the left posterior frontal lobe, just anterior to the motor cortex, with extensive surrounding edema . The timing of his new symptoms and the imaging findings were consistent with a metastatic brain lesion.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 T1 postgadolinium MRI brain with axial view.

The brain resection pathology revealed a malignant solitary fibrous tumor. It appeared similar to the SFT resected from the lung. It was comprised of spindled cells with storiform and haphazard arrangement. The tumor matrix was predominantly myxoid, and the cells were fed by a rich vascular network of small slit-like vessels and large ectatic branching vessels . The tumor showed immunoreactivity for CD34, Bcl-2, and STAT-6. The Ki-67 proliferation index approached 30%. His case was discussed at the regional multidisciplinary brain tumor board where the consensus recommends radiosurgery. He underwent single fraction Gamma Knife radiosurgery to the tumor cavity with a prescription dose of 22 Gy to the 50% isodose line . His weakness subsequently resolved.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8 Postresection, T1 postgadolinium MRI brain with axial view.

He was prescribed systemic treatment with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and Alimta and tolerated systemic therapy well but does continue to have generalized weakness, generalized dyspnea on exertion, and a chronic dry cough. At the time of this report, it has been 16 months since the Gamma Knife treatment and he has not developed subsequent recurrence of brain metastasis. He continues to receive treatment with pembrolizumab.\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】This is an unusual case of routine adenocarcinoma of the lung, but also SFT of the lung. Furthermore, the patient developed a symptomatic solitary brain metastasis from the SFT, not the lung adenocarcinoma, even more unusual and unexpected.\n\n【25】SFTs are rare mesenchymal neoplasms that account for less than 2% of all reported soft tissue tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, first reported in the literature by Wagner in 1870 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. SFTs were originally thought to only arise in the thoracic cavity, but it is now known that while most SFTs are intrathoracic and usually from the pleura, these tumors are frequently found in various locations throughout the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Peritoneal cavities, usually the retroperitoneum or pelvic soft tissue, are the primary site of origin in 30% of SFTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. 20% occur in the head and neck, the meninges, or extracranial locations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–12\\]</u>. These can include the sinonasal tract, oral cavity, and orbit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. There have also been cases of SFT arising from the extremities and bone as well as very few reported from the abdominal wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>. SFTs are most commonly benign, but 10–20% of cases have been reported to be malignant. SFTs usually occur in middle-aged patients and equally in men and women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The most common sites for metastasis are the lungs (61%), pleura (49%), liver (41%), bones (41%), and peritoneum (41%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. SFT has a low reported incidence of metastasis to the brain, especially low when compared to lung adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【26】SFTs are usually considered chemoresistant; therefore, localized treatments with surgery or radiation therapy are the most common modalities used. Initially, surgery is most effective, and tumor removal with negative margins of 1 to 2 cm, if possible, is recommended. Complete surgical resection of localized lesions is thought to be important for optimal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Though the literature is inconclusive about the most effective use, radiotherapy is a good adjuvant treatment before or after surgery in more complex conditions, such as in the case of an incomplete resection or if the tumor is inoperable. We have previously published clinical outcomes after radiosurgery or whole brain radiation for brain metastasis of various histologic types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. Radiation therapy is especially utilized in cases with malignant SFT, narrow margins, tumor size greater than 10 cm, and fast-growing tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. For example, in an analysis of 102 SFT cases, Krengli et al. reported that local control was higher in patients who were treated with surgery plus postoperative radiation therapy when compared to surgery alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. If the tumor has metastasized, adjuvant radiation therapy and sometimes chemotherapy are also used. However, Duranti et al. summarized their treatment of 337 patients with localized thoracic soft tissue sarcoma, where 51% received adjuvant radiotherapy and 41% received postoperative chemotherapy, and concluded the patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy presented with better local control than those who received adjuvant chemotherapy alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【27】When compared to brain metastasis from adenocarcinoma, brain metastasis from SFT is significantly less common. In a study of 16,210 patients with brain metastasis, the authors reported that brain metastasis from lung cancers (19.9%) occurs more frequently when compared to other types of cancer, such as melanoma (6.9%), renal (6.5%), breast (5.1%), and colorectal (1.8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Another study reported similar outcomes with a higher incidence of brain metastasis in lung cancer (16.3%) when compared to renal carcinoma (9.8%), melanoma (7.4%), breast carcinoma (5.0%), and colorectal carcinoma (1.2%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Of lung cancers, a study of 485 cases of patients with lung cancer by Villano et al. reported that the highest occurrence of brain metastasis was from adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. In addition, in a 2018 study of 373 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung, brain metastasis was reported to be one of the most common sites of distant metastasis and have a significantly higher rate of brain metastasis than other types of non-small-cell lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The relatively high metastatic rate to the brain from adenocarcinoma of the lung is historically documented in that a study published in 1988 reported brain metastasis in 28% of their 259 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【28】SFT has a much lower incidence of brain metastasis than adenocarcinoma. In a study of 139 patients with SFT (49 of which had metastases), O’Neill et al. reported that the most common sites of metastasis were the lungs (61%), pleura (49%), liver (41%), bones (41%), and peritoneum (41%). Only 8 of their 49 patients with metastases had brain metastases. The authors report that 5 patients had multiple brain metastases while 3 patients had single brain metastases. Six of the patients with brain metastases had tumors located extraaxially, 1 had extraaxially, and 1 had both extraaxially and intraaxially. The metastases were hypervascular in half of the patients, and the largest diameter was 1.4 cm (range, 0.5–2.8 cm). O’Neill et al. stated that brain metastases were most commonly from head and neck primary SFT, as seen in 5 patients, but also arose from 2 patients with thoracic SFT and 1 with abdominal SFT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Very few brain metastases from SFT have been reported in the literature.\n\n【29】Surgical excision generally yields a good prognosis for most SFT patients, as seen in a study by Gold et al. of 75 patients with SFTs in a wide range of anatomic sites. The authors reported that the factors predicting worse prognosis include positive surgical margins, large tumor size greater than 10 cm, and the presence of a histologically malignant component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Another study by van Houdt et al. similarly found that the variables most correlated with local recurrence and worse prognosis overall included positive resection margin, tumor size greater than 10 cm, and high mitosis rate. Five years after surgical resection of the 81 patients they followed, overall survival was 84%, local recurrence rate was 29%, and metastasis rate was 34% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Franzen et al. also emphasized the importance of a high mitotic index in recurrence and worse prognosis after following 42 SFT patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. A study by Tapias et al. reviews 59 patients with surgical treatment of SFT of the pleura (SFTP), one of the most common anatomical locations of SFT, to propose a score that can help predict recurrence of SFTP and guide postoperative surveillance. They report that their scoring system was better at predicting malignant behavior and recurrence than some other scores, such as England’s criteria or de Perrot staging. Their predictive score focuses on factors including mitotic activity, necrosis, sessile morphology, presence of hypercellularity, and size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. However, Franzen et al. in their study found the factors of tumor necrosis and sessile morphology to be statistically insignificant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Localized treatment for primary tumor typically consists of surgery with or without radiotherapy for SFT. SFT can be chemoresistant, or chemotherapy may have inconsistent effects in some patients, but a study at MD Anderson concludes that conventional chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin-based therapy, gemcitabine-based therapy, and paclitaxel, can be helpful in controlling or stabilizing locally advanced and metastatic SFT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Another study at MD Anderson reported that combination therapy with temozolomide and bevacizumab was well tolerated and almost as beneficial as surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. However, surgical excision still remains the treatment of choice. van Houdt et al. reported the factor most significantly correlated with local recurrence is the positive resection margin with a hazard ratio of 4.8 (confidence interval 95%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Compared to patients with a negative margin, patients with a positive resection margin have a statistically significant higher risk of local recurrence. In a study of 220 cases reported of intracranial and intraspinal SFT, Bisceglia et al. recommends surgery as the main treatment as well as stereotactic and external beam radiotherapy for unresectable tumors and some cases of postsurgical tumor remnants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Adjuvant radiotherapy is also often used for cases with extensive external invasion. In a very recent study, Bishop et al. reviewed 31 patients treated for SFT in multiple anatomic sites using both surgery and radiation therapy and reported 5-year rates of local control, overall survival, and distant metastatic-free survival as 100%, 95%, and 92%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. In another very recent study including 14 SFT patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy, Jia et al. also recommends adjuvant radiotherapy to lower recurrence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【31】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【32】We present a unique case of a patient with simultaneously diagnosed solitary fibrous tumor of the right lung and adenocarcinoma of the right lung, and who was later found to have a solitary fibrous tumor metastasis to the brain with a single left frontal lobe lesion.

Sometimes, VM is accompanied by cochlear symptoms suggestive for MD. Therefore, in those cases, the differential diagnosis between the two disorders can be difficult. Moreover, a comorbidity with migraine in MD patients is widely reported, up to the hypothesis of a possible MD-VM overlapping syndrome. In this brief case report, we consider the clinical history of a family presenting high incidence of subjects fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of VM and single case fulfilling criteria for definite MD. The relationship between VM and MD is still under debate; anyway, it can be speculated that commonly shared genetic mutations could play a role as predisposing factors in both disorders. A congenital nystagmus in the family was present too, but its correlation with the other conditions is still not clear. Future goal of our work will be to assess genetics in this family.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Vestibular migraine (VM) is a very common neurotological disorder affecting 1-2% of the European population, whose diagnostic criteria, based on clinical history, have recently been drawn up by a joint committee of the Barany Society and International Headache Society 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The followings are criteria for definite VM:(A)At least five episodes with vestibular symptoms of a moderate or severe intensity, lasting from 5 minutes to 72 hours(B)Current or previous history of migraine with or without aura according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)(C)One or more migraine features with at least 50% of the vestibular episodes(i)Headache with at least two of the following characteristics: one side location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, and aggravation by routine physical activity;(ii)Photophobia and phonophobia(iii)Visual aura(D)Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis\n\n【5】In order to diagnose probable VM, only one of the criteria B or C must be observed. For probable VM, only one of B/C criteria should be fulfilled.\n\n【6】Recently, some authors have tried to highlight its clinical characteristics, noting, however, a strong heterogenicity of symptoms and phenotypes; above all, according to some authors, cochlear symptoms such as fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness have been reported by several patients during VM attacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. As a consequence, in early stages, a differential diagnosis between VM and Menière’s disease (MD) may be difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【7】On the other side, among MD subjects, a comorbidity with migraine is far from being rare, ranging from 40 to 50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【8】The overlap of vertigo attacks in the same patient with features of VM and MD for duration of attacks and accompanying symptoms has been reported by some authors, who proposed for the condition the name of VM/MD overlapping syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Genetic factors have been studied as a predisposing factor for both MD and VM, although at present, results are inconclusive, and normally, signs and symptoms of the diseases tend to appear at an earlier age as the disorder is passed from one generation to the next (anticipation) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>; curiously, in one work, it has been reported that 66% of VM patients referred another relative in the first or second degree suffering from vertigo, and when asked about the known diagnosis 7.1% referred MD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, underlying the possibility of commonly shared genetic predisposing factors between the two disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【10】The aim of this work is to describe the case of a family presenting a high incidence of subjects presenting episodic vertigo fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for definite VM and a single case presenting episodic vertigo fulfilling criteria for definite MD.\n\n【11】#### 2\\. Clinical History\n\n【12】The first sister, aged 14, presented a smooth horizontal conjugate left beating nystagmus, according to the parents congenital; the frequency of nystagmus increased during execution of pursuits, during which the two phases seemed to be of equal velocity , and decreased during movements of convergence, but the patient did not refer oscillopsia.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The records of spontaneous nystagmus of the first sister in the primary position (a) and during execution of pursuits (b).</u>\n\n【14】She was studied previously by neurologists and ophthalmologists without conclusive results; she does not suffer from albinism. When six-year-old, she suffered from torticollis, while till present, she had motion sickness. At the age of 12, she began to suffer from internal vertigo attacks lasting around 30 minutes and normally followed by headaches with migrainous features (lasting till 1 day, with photo and phonophobia, worsening with efforts and located around one eye and spreading to the left hemicranium, without aura). Vertigo was accompanied by nausea/vomiting, but no cochlear symptoms were reported. Rather than for the presence of congenital nystagmus, she fulfilled criteria for definite vestibular migraine. The frequency of vertigo spells was around one month, more frequently in the catamenial period. As a consequence of the congenital nystagmus, pursuits presented an almost complete saccadization, and vestibular assessment was poorly reliable. She had a normal audiometric threshold.\n\n【15】The second sister, aged 23, suffered of abdominal pain and motion sickness when she was around 4. From the age of 12, she suffered from headache with migrainous features (pulsatile and accompanied by photo and phonophobia, without aura) without vertigo, lasting till two days. At the age of 18, she began to report vertigo attacks lasting several hours with vomiting, fullness, and fluctuating hearing loss on the right side, not associated with migrainous symptoms. She reported a frequency of one attack every 6 months, more frequently, but not always in the catamenial period. An audiometric exam demonstrated low to medium frequencies sensorineural hearing loss on the right side with a difference in threshold of 40 decibel (dB) between 250 and 1000 Hertz (Hz) suggestive for a hydropic disorder . A vestibular bedside examination (including video head impulse, head shaking, skull vibration, and positional tests and eye movements evaluation) was negative rather than for the presence of a left beating nystagmus during the skull vibration test.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 The audiogram showing low to medium frequencies sensorineural hearing loss on the second sister’s right ear.</u>\n\n【17】Both sisters performed a central nervous system MRI, always negative for any pathological condition.\n\n【18】The father, aged 57, presented a history of migrainous headache from the age of 30, without aura and sporadical attacks of dizziness from the age of 35, without a sure correlation with headache. He suffered from hypertensive disorders anyhow well controlled with beta-blockers. An audiometric exam showed a bilateral and symmetric high frequency hearing loss, compatible with presbycusis. He fulfilled criteria for probable VM.\n\n【19】The mother, aged 47, suffered from benign paroxysmal vertigo in pediatric age (around 4-5 years old); she had migrainous headaches (without aura) from the age of 23 and in the last three years also sporadic vertigo lasting not more than 30 minutes often accompanied by a long lasting (till one day) headache and nausea. The bedside examination demonstrated normal pursuits and saccades and a positive skull vibration test. A central nervous system magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed microischemic lesions.\n\n【20】The mother had one sister and two brothers. The sister, aged 50, reported a positive history for migrainous headache, whose onset was at around 25; she also reported short episodes of dizziness/internal vertigo lasting 10 minutes since she was 35-year-old, more frequently during headaches, while some episodes of migrainous headache were preceded by eye flashes of light lasting minutes (compatible with aura). Central nervous system MRI highlighted microischemic lesions.\n\n【21】One of the two brothers, aged 52, also suffered from migrainous headache (without aura), whose onset was at 30. The other brother, aged 53, had no pathological disorder except for a mild hypertension well controlled with diuretic.\n\n【22】No affordable data were found on grandparents, except that maternal grandmother also suffered from headaches from the age of 25. A pedigree describing the distribution of the pathologies in this family is shown in Figure 3.\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Pedigree of the family starting from the grandparents. The circles represent women; the squares represent men; the green color represents healthy people who does not fulfill criteria for vestibular migraine or Ménière’s disease; the light blue color represents people with the history of migraine without vertigo; the blue color represents people who fulfills criteria for vestibular migraine; the white color represents people who fulfills criteria for definite Ménière’s disease.</u>\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Some speculations can be made concerning this family case. Our family presents a high rate of VM, since one sister and parents presented a clinical history of VM (definite or probable). The aunt also satisfied diagnostic criteria for definite VM.\n\n【26】Moreover, considering the onset of both migraine and vestibular migraine, an anticipation of the onset of both migrainous headache and vertigo should be underlined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>; second, both daughters reported an history of migraine precursors (torticollis and motion sickness in the younger; abdominal pain and motion sickness in the other); similarly, the mother reported short episodes of dizziness resembling benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The particular feature of this case is the onset of a MD phenotype in a migraineur woman, whose family presented phenotypes of migraine and definite (the sister and mother) or probable (the father) VM.\n\n【28】As a first consideration, it is still under debate if MD is a single disorder or a burden of symptoms, and recently, some authors proposed to differentiate five groups of patients with unilateral and five with bilateral MD according to a cluster analysis of comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Among these groups, the subgroups of subjects with migraine presented a lower age of onset of vertigo.\n\n【29】The relationship between the two disorders is at present under debate. For example, it has been reported that VM attacks may be accompanied by cochlear symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. On the other hand, some authors proposed the possibility of a simultaneous presentation of the disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, and the case of a contemporary presentation of migraine, MD, and other episodic vertigo in six families has been published some years ago 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Since for both VM and MD a genetic predisposition has been proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, it can be speculated that a commonly shared genetic variance may be the reason of overlapping of vertigo phenotypes. Among the possibilities, ionic transporters have been proposed as a predisposing factor for both migraine and MD, and it can be speculated that this is the reason of the overlapping in the family of VM and MD phenotypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In particular, Oh et al. identified a mutation involving TRPM7 gene encoding Ca2+ and Mg2+ ionic channels in a family suffering from VM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【31】However, this is not the first report about this topic. In fact, Requena et al. reported a case of probable VM in a family with familial MD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, whereas Martìn-Sierra et al. reported several cases of migraine not cosegregated with MD in a family suffering from the same disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Moreover, in a recent study, VM patients showed to have a positive familial history for MD in 7.1% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The association between infantile-congenital nystagmus in one of the daughters, migraine, and MD is not clear, but their concomitant presence in the same family is very interesting. As far as we know, excluding neurological disorders, a single X-linked gene, FRMD-7, has been proposed as a candidate for the disorder, encoding a protein, the FERM domain-containing protein 7, which plays an important role in neuronal development and is involved in the regulation of F-actin, although its specific mechanism of action remains undetermined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【33】In conclusion, a single subject in the migraineur family presents a different phenotype coherent with MD, suggesting the possibility that common genetic mutations could play a relevant role as predisposing factors in both disorders. A case of congenital nystagmus was present too, but its correlation with other conditions is still not clear. Future goal of our work will be to assess genetics in this family.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:48:41", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:49:46", "cost": 64.731}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:49:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:48:39"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Influenza viruses are divided into three types, influenza A, B, and C viruses. Influenza A viruses cause epidemic influenza and sporadic pandemics, and they are further classified into subtypes on the basis of the antigenic properties of two surface glycopeptides, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 18 different H subtypes and 11 different N subtypes (H1 to H18 and N1 to N11).

We report the first case in the English literature of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection and review the prior reported literature.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 50-year-old man with past medical history of hypothyroidism and cigarette smoking had been on vacation in Florida, USA, with his family for 3 weeks. The day of his return flight in July, he developed a sore throat and body aches followed by fever and a productive cough. He went to urgent care, was diagnosed with acute bronchitis, and was treated as outpatient with azithromycin and prednisone for 5 days without improvement. On the eighth day of symptoms, he developed confusion and was brought to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation.\n\n【8】In the ED, the patient had mild shortness of breath but denied nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. On physical exam, he had temperature 38.3°C, heart rate 120 beats/min, respiratory rate 25 breaths/min, and SpO<sub>2</sub> 90% on room air, with coarse breath sounds bilaterally on lung exam; he was started on oxygen 2 L/min via nasal cannula. A chest X-ray showed bibasilar lung infiltrates. Testing revealed white blood cell count 9.0 k/uL (4.0–10.0 k/uL), hemoglobin (Hb) 15.8 g/dL (13.0–18.0 g/dL), platelets 249 k/uL (150–400 k/uL), international normalized ratio 1.4 (≤3.5), protime 15.1 seconds (10.0–12.0 seconds), partial thromboplastin time 37.4 seconds (25.0–35.0 seconds), blood urea nitrogen 28 mg/dL (9–20 mg/dL), creatinine 1.46 mg/dL (0.66–1.25 mg/dL), total protein 7.5 g/dL (6.3–8.2 g/dL), albumin 3.9 g/dL (3.5–5.0 g/dL), total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL (0.2–1.3 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 195 U/L (38–126 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 160 U/L (21–72 U/L), and aspartate aminotransferase 243 U/L (17–59 U/L). Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen tests were negative. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed a contracted gallbladder with probable calculi and normal pancreas and spleen. He was diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia, started on intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and admitted to the medical floor. He was also started on heparin 5000 U subcutaneously every 8 hours for thromboembolism prophylaxis.\n\n【9】The patient’s shortness of breath deteriorated overnight. Chest X-ray showed worsening lung infiltrates, predominantly in the left lung. He had increased work of breathing and worsening hypoxemia requiring oxygen via high flow nasal cannula and transfer to the intensive care unit. More information was obtained from the family: his wife and father also had developed a cough and no one in the family including the patient had ever received influenza vaccination. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) respiratory viral panel on a nasopharyngeal swab sample was positive for influenza A (H1N1) virus, and therapy was started with oseltamivir.\n\n【10】The patient’s respiratory status continued to worsen. He developed hypotension and severe abdominal pain on the third day of hospitalization. Serum amylase was 157 U/L (30–110 U/L) and lipase 1454 U/L (23–300 U/L). Hb decreased from 15.8 to 7.4 g/dL. Coagulation parameters were normal. Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.5 (7.35–7.45), PaCO<sub>2</sub> 21 mm Hg (35–45 mm Hg), and PaO<sub>2</sub> 52 mm Hg (80–100 mm Hg) on high flow nasal cannula FiO<sub>2</sub> 70% at 50 L/min and the patient was subsequently intubated. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen revealed lung consolidation of the left upper lobe and infiltrates in both lower lobes and right middle lobe, with no evidence of pulmonary embolism . The lateral margin of the spleen was indistinct and with low density areas, concerning for splenic injury or rupture . The patient denied any prior abdominal trauma.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Computed tomography scan (CT) of the chest showing infiltrates in both lower lung lobes.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Initial computed tomography scan (CT) of the abdomen showing perihepatic and perisplenic fluid, and the lateral margin of the spleen indistinct with low density areas, concerning for splenic injury or rupture.</u>\n\n【13】Due to these findings along with suspected ongoing hemorrhage with decreasing Hb values since admission, the patient underwent an embolization of the splenic artery by interventional radiology. Despite this procedure, Hb values continued to decrease, remaining at 7.7 g/dL despite transfusion with 3 units of packed red blood cells. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy with splenectomy to control the hemorrhage. During the surgery, there was extensive hemoperitoneum and the spleen capsular surface was found to be hemorrhagic with a large laceration in the mid portion . Pathologic examination revealed a spleen with weight 521 g and size 15 cm × 10 cm × 6 cm. The capsular surface was deep red due to hemorrhage with an irregular 10 cm laceration in the mid portion nearly bisecting the specimen with an intact hilar margin. There was a slightly puckered area located 5.5 cm from the point of laceration with an underlying somewhat stellate area of apparent fibrous tissue with vascular proliferation consistent with a hemangioma measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The splenic parenchyma was red brown. There was a large hematoma with a focal rim of tan white fibrous tissue. There was no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Appearance of the spleen after splenectomy. The capsular surface was hemorrhagic with an irregular 10 cm laceration in the mid portion nearly bisecting the spleen with an intact hilum.</u>\n\n【15】A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the operating room after the splenectomy, and the culture was positive for influenza A (H1N1) virus only. Infectious mononucleosis and malaria work up were negative. The patient was continued on oseltamivir for treatment of influenza pneumonia and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, was extubated successfully after 14 days of mechanical ventilatory support, and was discharged home in good condition after 40 days of hospitalization.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】We present the case of a patient with severe influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia and respiratory failure, who experienced atraumatic splenic rupture requiring emergency splenectomy to control hemorrhagic shock. While associated with other viral infections, atraumatic splenic rupture has been very rarely reported in association with influenza infection, and to our knowledge, never in the English literature as the only associated condition.\n\n【18】In addition to its common symptoms, some patients with influenza A (H1N1) virus infection develop severe disease, complicated with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and other organ damage such as myositis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, encephalopathy, and liver function abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition to pneumonia and respiratory failure, our patient experienced acute renal failure and transaminitis, as well as an atraumatic splenic rupture with hemorrhagic shock, requiring multiple transfusions and emergency splenectomy after a failed splenic artery embolization. Splenic rupture can be life-threatening and requires a high index of clinical suspicion and emergent intervention to prevent death. Since the spleen plays a key role in combating infection, a conservative, interventional, or spleen-preserving surgical approach should be attempted first. However, total splenectomy should be performed for patients with severe rupture, hemodynamic instability, or continued and recurrent bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Atraumatic splenic rupture is rare. Common causes include infection, neoplasms, and vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 10\\]</u>. One large systematic review reported 613 cases of splenic rupture without risk factors or previously diagnosed diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Malaria, mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus infection, and typhoid fever were common infectious causes. Only 3 cases were associated with pneumonia, 2 of them caused by Legionella infection. Influenza infection was not reported in that study. Another systematic review reported 845 patients with atraumatic splenic rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>; of those, 137 patients had an infectious cause, but none had influenza infection.\n\n【20】The precise pathologic mechanisms implicated in atraumatic splenic rupture have not been conclusively determined and probably vary from case to case. Mechanisms that have been proposed in different cases include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> increased intra-abdominal pressure (related to coughing, sneezing, emesis, defecation, and pregnancy) leading to accumulated trauma on the splenic capsule; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> an increase in intrasplenic tension due to cellular hyperplasia and vascular engorgement; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> reticular endothelial hyperplasia resulting in thrombosis and infarction, leading to hemorrhage and rupture of the splenic capsule. In addition, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and platelet dysfunction may prolong hemorrhage that would otherwise be self-limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【21】It is possible that an exaggerated immune response to influenza infection may play a role in this rare complication. The influenza A (H1N1) virus has been isolated on organ samples of the lung, brain, kidney, and spleen on animal experiments, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and it has also been reported that the spleen plays a particularly active role in the innate immune response to influenza A (H1N1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The precise mechanisms involved in this case are unclear, but there was a productive cough present which could have contributed to the rupture and the patient was also receiving a prophylactic dose of heparin. While a very small hemangioma was noted on histologic examination, there was no evidence of bleeding in its location.\n\n【22】So far, there have been at least 5 other cases reported of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection, none in the English literature. The first case was in Russia (former Soviet Union) in 1963 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A 43 y/o woman with severe influenza reported mild pain in the left upper abdomen. She was treated as an outpatient and recovered completely. One month after the symptoms started, she developed severe abdominal pain in the same area and fever 38°C. Four days later, she was admitted to the hospital with severe diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, fever 38.5°C, and unmeasurable blood pressure. On exam, she was very pale, the abdomen was distended and tender, and a fluid shift was present. She was treated for hemorrhagic shock and underwent emergency laparotomy with splenectomy. Surgical findings were an enlarged ruptured spleen and 1.5 L of blood and clots in the abdominal cavity. On pathology, the spleen was congested with blood, with lymphoid hyperplasia and necrotic tissue around the rupture. The patient recovered.\n\n【23】The second case occurred in Poland in 1964 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A 22-year-old male had influenza and related symptoms for 10 days. One day after admission, he developed severe pain in the left epigastric and lumbar regions and anemia that did not respond to transfusion. On the sixth day, the pain increased, and the patient underwent a laparotomy with splenectomy. An enlarged, necrosed spleen was noted with blood clots surrounding it and 1 L of blood in the peritoneal cavity. He recovered.\n\n【24】A third case was reported in Ukraine (former Soviet Union) in 1969 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A 60-year-old woman was admitted with influenza pneumonia confirmed by antibody titers. She had severe headache, fever 38.1°C, cough, and rhinorrhea. Over the next four days, all symptoms resolved, but she then developed acute, severe pain in the epigastric area, nausea, and vomiting. Blood pressure was 80/40 mm Hg, with severe tachycardia and Hb 5.2 g/dL. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy for worsening shock. During the surgery, 2 L of blood and clots were found in the abdominal cavity along with a ruptured spleen requiring splenectomy. On pathology of the spleen, there was significant sclerosis of the red pulp and of the stroma surrounding the follicles. Almost all vessels were significantly narrowed with thickened walls; parts of the vessel walls had necrotic changes and there was cellular debris in some follicles. The patient was discharged home 2 months later. Of note, the article references one additional case of splenic rupture with influenza authored by PM Geyler in 1963; full reference was not provided, and the report was not able to be located despite a comprehensive search.\n\n【25】A fourth case was published in Hungary in 1979 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A 57-year-old man with influenza had experienced 7 days of fever and limb pain at home and was already improving. He then developed weakness and dizziness and was admitted to the hospital. He had abdominal pain, Hb 9.9 g/dL, tachycardia, and hypotension. He underwent laparotomy where a large amount of clotted blood was found in the abdominal cavity. The spleen had a transverse rupture of 1.5 cm on its anterior surface, which did not penetrate the entire thickness and a splenectomy was done. On gross examination, the spleen weighed 160 g and demonstrated a 3 cm disruption laterally in the lower third extending 5–6 mm into the parenchyma. On microscopy, the follicular pattern was preserved with prominent germinal centers. Areas of parenchymal hemorrhage were also noted. The histological picture was thought to be similar to changes seen in sepsis, which suggested to the authors the possibility of a viral infection as the cause.\n\n【26】A fifth case was published in Spain in 2011 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A 36-year-old man had fever 39.5°C, vomiting, diarrhea, and epigastric pain for 5 days and was admitted. On exam, he had blood pressure 95/55 mm Hg and heart rate 100 beats/min. One day later, the patient had intense abdominal pain and lost consciousness when standing. His Hb was 8.9 g/dL and an abdominal CT showed lung alveolar infiltrate in the bases and a splenic rupture with active hemorrhage and hemoperitoneum. A laparotomy with splenectomy was done. On pathology, the spleen was of normal size with the external surface showing some hemorrhagic areas with adherent clots that covered less than 5% of the external surface. A histologic diagnosis of capsular rupture with hemorrhagic foci over a normal spleen was made. After the urgent surgery, the patient recovered and was later diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia with a positive PCR test.\n\n【27】The above mentioned 5 cases, except for the last one, were reported more than 40 years ago. Reports were brief, with limited information provided including figures and diagnostic methods and with outdated terminology. They do, however, have all in common a diagnosis of splenic rupture without a history of prior trauma and an associated diagnosis of influenza, with the influenza-related symptoms preceding the abdominal signs and symptoms, anemia, and hemorrhagic shock associated with the splenic rupture.\n\n【28】Besides the abovementioned cases, there is one reported case in the English literature of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza A (H1N1) infection. However, this case also had coinfection with Legionella pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, which has also been associated with splenic rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, so it cannot be ruled out that the splenic rupture could be due to Legionella infection instead of the influenza infection, or due to coinfection. The patient was a 42-year-old man who was hospitalized with fever of 39°C, progressive dyspnea, and nonproductive cough. On admission, he had anemia with Hb of 5 g/dL and tested positive both for influenza A (H1N1) virus by PCR test on a throat swab and for Legionella by urinary antigen test and PCR in peripheral blood. Total body CT showed extensive bilateral interstitial pneumonia and signs of incipient splenic rupture. He underwent laparotomy with splenectomy. Histological examination showed diffuse splenic intravascular coagulation. The patient achieved full clinical recovery.\n\n【29】In conclusion, we present a very rare case of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza A (H1N1) infection, which required emergency laparotomy with splenectomy to control hemorrhage after a failed splenic artery embolization. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the English literature of this complication associated with influenza infection, and only one of a handful reported previously worldwide. Clinicians should be aware of this very rare but potentially fatal complication of influenza infection, in particular in patients who develop abdominal signs and symptoms, unexplained anemia, and hemodynamic instability.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:53:30", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:53:52", "cost": 21.749}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:53:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:53:29"}

Physical examination was unremarkable other than an enlarged liver extending to 5 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory tests showed WBC of 9430 K/μL, hbg of 12.4 g/dL, hct of 36.2%, plt of 2000 K/μL, calcium of 14.9 mg/dL (8.6–10.2), phosphate of 1.8 mg/dL (2.6–4.5), albumin of 3.4 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 295 通用删除7(英):<u>(40–130)</u>, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) of 363 U/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–60)</u>.

Patient was evaluated surgically as inoperable with evidence of radiological and pathological findings and was directed to medical oncology department for purpose of palliative chemotherapy with intended radiotherapy for bone metastasis .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | After treatment, relationship with calcium and thrombocyte level. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】At the end of first month of the oncologic treatment, patient was readmitted to hospital with worsening of consciousness state and relapsed hypercalcemia (11.5 mg/dL), while thrombocyte count was normal. Calcium level was higher than normal levels but not as high as first admittance to lead to thrombocytopenia again. Medical treatment of hypercalcemia rapidly stabilized the patient consciousness state. In spite of the chemoradiation treatment, disseminated metastasis developed and patient died in the 5th month of diagnosis.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】CC is a rare neoplasm which accounts for approximately 3% of the gastrointestinal cancers worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although surgical resection remains the only curative treatment, most patients with CC are not operable candidates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Hypercalcemia is a serious and frequent complication and a sign of advanced stage of malignant disease, occurring in 10% to 20% of patients with malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It has been estimated to be of 5.3% in patients with HCC and 17.5% in patients with CC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Approximately 85% of patients with cancer and hypercalcemia have metastatic bone disease. The remaining 15% have some other etiology for hypercalcemia as paraneoplastic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HHM) is characterised by elevated calcium, low serum phosphorus, low PTH, and low vitamin D levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The type of hypercalcemia has been associated with the abnormal secretion of various proteins, including PTH-rP by the tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. HHM is usually manifested as certain type of malignancies and is generally associated with squamous-cell carcinomas of esophagus, lung, head, and neck. HHM is rarely seen with CC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The present case had multiple metastatic bone lesions. So, predominantly, these lesions were thought of as the reason for hypercalcemia. And the mechanism of hypercalcemia had no effect on treatment of our case, so we did not need to differentiate etiology of hypercalcemia.\n\n【13】Medical treatment of hypercalcemia is composed of IV hydration with saline, loop diuretics, and antiresorptive agents such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Thrombocytopenia in these cases may occur for many reasons and can be seen in some liver tumors like angiosarcomas and hemangiomas. The relationship between hypercalcemia and thrombocytopenia is not clear but in literature it is stated that there is correlation between hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia also impairs granulocyte function by interfering with ATP synthesis, increasing platelet diameter, and shortening platelet survival so it triggers the marked platelet disappearence. And these lead to thrombocytopenia and reactive megakaryocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In this case thrombocyte level was as low as 2000 K/μL. But there was not any spontaneous bleeding. So we did not need transfusion. The patient was treated with IV saline, diuretics, and calcitonin.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【16】We presented a case of metastatic CC with symptomatic hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and low platelet count.

Not only are the symptoms of the first presentation but also the ages of presentation are very variable. Following three case reports, different causes of possible late presentation are discussed. Many factors are responsible for the age at which sickle cell disease is diagnosed: doctor’s delay (unfamiliarity with the disease), patient’s delay (education and financial position of the parents, cultural factors), high- versus low-resource country (availability of newborn screening), fetal hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and genetic modulators, such as SCD genotype, alpha-thalassemia, fetal hemoglobin concentration, and G6PD deficiency. The individual course of sickle cell disease depends on (epi) genetic and environmental properties and the underlying interactions. In further studies, the role of each factor should be evaluated more deeply, and its use as a marker of disease severity or activity should be assessed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common group of life-threatening, genetic disorders caused by the synthesis of abnormal hemoglobin (sickle hemoglobin), which when deoxygenated, polymerizes and causes sickling of red blood cells. SCD is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, vasoocclusion, and progressive vascular injury causing multiorgan damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The clinic of SCD is quite variable and reflects the interactions with other genetic and environmental factors and can include painful vasoocclusive crises (VOCs), acute chest syndrome, cerebral stroke, and acute and chronic hemolysis. Due to functional hyposplenism, there is susceptibility to invasive bacterial infection with encapsulated bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, India, and the Mediterranean area, SCD is the most prevalent, where more than 90% of the annual SCD births take place, but due to migration, SCD can be diagnosed also in other parts of the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. While newborn screening and follow-up with prophylactic interventions are common in high-resource countries, most children die before the age of 5 years, often before a diagnosis was made, in low-resource countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Sickle cell anemia (SCA) refers solely to patients homozygous for the sickle mutation (HbSS) and is together with sickle β°-thalassemia responsible for more severe diseases in the group of SCD. Hemoglobin SC disease and sickle β⁺-thalassemia are common and in general, less severe presentations of SCD. Hemoglobin SD and hemoglobin SE are much less common.\n\n【6】The individual course of SCD is heterogeneous and depends not only on several genetic factors, such as the concomitant presence of alpha-thalassemia, sickle β\\-haplotypes, fetal hemoglobin levels, and G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency, but also on environmental properties and their underlying interactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There can be a widespread diversity in clinic and first presentation between different communities, but sometimes also in the same family 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. A late first presentation is not always so straightforward, and patient and doctor’s delay is not uncommon as we will show in two cases.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentations\n\n【8】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【9】A twenty-month-old boy with no relevant medical history presented at the outpatient clinic with limping for 7 days (D7 = day 7 of disease) without a prior trauma. Fever up to 38.5 degrees Celsius was noted over the last week. The boy was born at term by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery following a normal pregnancy; his weight at birth was 3.6 kilograms. He was the first child of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents from Angola. The family history did not reveal any relevant information except that the mother is a carrier of sickle cell anemia (HbAS), which was denied to the father. Physical examination showed a mild sick, male with normal cardiovascular and respiratory parameters, with 38.5 degrees Celsius. The skin was pale, without signs of jaundice. There were no signs of dehydration. ENT examination showed mild rhinorrhea with some pharyngeal redness. Heart and lung auscultation was normal. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Neurological examination was normal. We saw mild limping of the right leg with mildly painful abduction right hip. The initial complete blood count showed a mild, microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL (normal 10.5–13.6 g/dL), MCV 68 (normal 70–85 fL), reticulocytes 60/1000 RBC (normal 11–29/1000 RBC), leukocytes of 12.3 × 10E9/L (normal 6.0–17.0 × 10E9/L) with normal differentiation, and thrombocytes of 559 × 10E9/L (normal 304–574 × 10E9/L). Blood smear revealed poikilocytosis, tear cells, schistocytes, and some target cells. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated up to 144 mg/L (normal ≤ 5 mg/L). An ultrasound of the ankles, knees, and hips did not show any abnormalities. Under suspicion of reactive arthritis, the patient was sent home with bedrest, pain medication, and follow-up appointment.\n\n【10】At D13, he was again seen in the outpatient clinic; his temperature normalized over the last few days, while his physical examination did not reveal changes. The ultrasound of the hip was normal. A radiograph of the pelvis showed irregularities of the right iliac wing. Bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-MDP revealed an elevated distribution at the right pelvic wing anterolaterally, possible of an inflammatory nature. Because CRP spontaneously improved (23.9 mg/L (normal ≤ 5 mg/L)) and of the absence of fever, an MRI of the pelvis was requested as an outpatient.\n\n【11】At D19, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) revealed an increased signal of the right iliac wing on the STIR 通用删除1(英):<u>(short-TI inversion recovery)</u> images. The adjacent soft tissue captures the contrast. The image suggests osteomyelitis. The patient was admitted. CRP normalized to 3 mg/l. His temperature was normal. After blood cultures were drawn, IV (intravenously) antibiotics, cefotaxime and flucloxacillin, were started. Blood culture did not reveal any growth. Because of an atypical course, more extensive research into possible explanation has been carried out, including cultures for Salmonella typhi and Kingella kingae, the tuberculin skin test, and serology for HIV. They were all negative. Before a biopsy of the bone lesion was performed, hemoglobin electrophoresis confirmed sickle cell anemia (HbA2 2.3%, HbF 24.5%, and HbS 73.2%). Due to the absence of clear sickle cells in the blood smear, denial of carrier status (HbAS) of the father, late recognition that the limping is pain due to VOC, and the presence of a high HbF, the diagnose of sickle cell anemia was delayed.\n\n【12】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【13】A three-year-old boy was followed by a pediatric rheumatologist on suspicion of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis due to varying pains in his hands and feet for 18 months. Sporadically, the child refused to walk. Often, these episodes were preceded by fever and eased with ibuprofen. No rash was reported. He presented in the clinic of the pediatric rheumatologist with fever (39 degrees Celsius) for 1-2 weeks with limping and painful swelling of the right tibia above the ankle. He was initially seen by the pediatric rheumatologist who made the diagnosis of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and treatment with ibuprofen and corticosteroids was started. The body temperature normalized, but pain and swelling of the tibia remained, after which the child was admitted.\n\n【14】The boy was born at term by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery following a normal pregnancy; his weight at birth was 3 kilograms. He was the first child of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents from Guinea. The family history did not reveal any relevant information.\n\n【15】Physical examination at the first presentation showed a moderate sick male with normal cardiovascular and respiratory parameters, with a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius. The skin was pale. No signs of dehydration. No signs of upper respiratory tract infection. Heart and lung auscultation were normal.\n\n【16】The abdomen was showing mild hepatomegaly (3-4 cm under the costal arch), and the spleen was not palpable. Extremities: at the right tibia, warm, painful swelling several centimeters proximal of the distal metaphysis. The left tibia was painful on palpation, but no other clinical signs.\n\n【17】The initial complete blood count showed a severe, normocytic anemia with hemoglobin of 6.4 g/dL (normal 11.5–13.5 g/dL), reticulocytes 77/1000 RBC (normal 8–20/1000 RBC), leukocytes of 15.3 × 10E9/L (normal 5.5–15.5 × 10E9/L) with normal differentiation, and thrombocytes of 448 × 10E9/L (normal 228–433 × 10E9/L). Blood smear revealed hypochromasia, target cells, poikilocytosis, and sickle cells. There were no signs of hemolysis with normal lactate dehydrogenase (707 U/L (normal 425–975 U/L)) and total bilirubin (0.7 mg/dL (normal 0.2–1.3)). C-reactive protein was 56 mg/L (normal ≤ 5 mg/L).\n\n【18】After admission to the pediatric department, within hours, his clinical condition worsened with prolonged capillary refill with tachycardia (192/minute) but normal blood pressure. After blood cultures were drawn, IV ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg) was started together with IV fluid resuscitation (NaCl 0.9%, 20 mL/kg) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. X-ray of the right tibia showed significant soft tissue swelling from the distal lower leg and at the distal metaphysis, a slight clearance with possible cortex interruption. Bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-MDP reveals a bone injury at the right distal tibia with a hyperemic component, compatible with an abscess. Surgical drainage showed a lot of pus with a culture showing growth of Salmonella typhimurium. Antibiotic treatment was switched to high dose amoxicillin according to the sensitivity. Blood and stool cultures remained negative. Hemoglobin electrophoresis confirmed the diagnosis of sickle cell disease (HbA2 2.7%, HbF 24.1%, and HbS 73%). The initial wrong diagnosis (doctor’s delays) by not recognizing sickle cell disease despite high risk based on ethnicity and VOC and the high HbF were responsible for the late diagnosis.\n\n【19】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【20】A three-year-old girl without a relevant medical history was admitted to the hospital under the suspicion of pneumonia. She was born at term by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery following a normal pregnancy; her weight at birth was 3.2 kilogram. She was the second child of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents from Mali. The family history did not reveal any relevant information. Physical examination showed a sick female with mild tachycardia (pulse 134/minute) and moderate dyspnea (34/minute), with 39.1 degrees Celsius. The skin was pale, no signs of jaundice, and no signs of dehydration. ENT examination showed the presence of mild rhinorrhea with some pharyngeal redness. Systolic murmur 1/6 was over the heart and diminished air-entry over the right lower lobe. The abdomen was not showing hepatosplenomegaly. The initial complete blood count showed a mild, microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL (normal 10.5–13.6 g/dL), reticulocytes of 30/1000 RBC (normal 11–29/1000 RBC), leukocytes of 10.3 × 10E9/L (normal 6.0–17.0 × 10E9/L) with normal differentiation, and thrombocytes of 316 × 10E9/L (normal 229–435 × 10E9/L). Blood smear revealed poikilocytosis, polychromasia, and target cells. C-reactive protein (CRP) was only mildly elevated up to 30 mg/L (normal ≤ 5 mg/L). X-thorax showed a consolidation in the region of the right lower lobe. Under suspicion of pneumonia, intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was initiated. Despite the ethnicity and the clinic of an acute chest syndrome, only in the context of the anemia, a hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed, revealing the presence of hemoglobin C (42%) and hemoglobin S (46%). Family research showed that the parents are carriers (mother HbC 32% and father HbS 42%), and their first-born male has the same condition as his sister, namely, hemoglobin SC disease. After discharge, antibiotic prophylaxis and folic acid were initiated.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】The patients presented in this case series are born in Belgium. They are of sub-Saharan African immigrant families and demonstrate a high frequency of SCD mutations. In their native countries, newborn screening and comprehensive healthcare only rarely takes place at an early age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, therefore, resulting in a wide variation of the age at diagnosis of SCD. The medium age reported varies from 2 until 6 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–12\\]</u>. Sarat et al. report that in Brazil, the medium age at diagnosis of the adults receiving care for HbSS was five years and for HSC, 21 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Even in high-resource countries such as Belgium, universal newborn screening and prenatal counseling are not always performed. According to the German SCD registry, most children were discovered after the age of one year, usually by presenting with symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. The median age at diagnosis of a cohort of children with SCD in the Netherlands was 25 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Often due to the lack of knowledge of the physicians regarding SCD, even symptoms, typically associated with clinical manifestations of SCD, are misinterpreted, resulting in inadequate treatment. It is important to address these important public health issues.\n\n【23】There can be several other factors also responsible for the manner and the time at which the disease presents itself, some of which will be discussed .\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Factors influencing the age of presentation of SCD in children.</u>\n\n【25】##### 3.1. Western World versus Developing Countries\n\n【26】Although patients with SCA have an identical monogenic condition, its clinical phenotypes are highly variable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. Different pathways play a role in the pathophysiology, and different genes have been under evolutionary pressure. It is fair to assume that ethnic differences influence the course of SCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The vast majority and burden of disease is in sub-Saharan Africa. Because of economic limitations, newborn screening of hemoglobin disorders is not achieved. Diagnosis is mostly delayed until children have clinical signs. Screening because of a positive family history is possible yet less applied because of financial considerations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Also, not infrequently, the belief in evil spirits may be one obstacle for seeking timely medical care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【27】In sub-Saharan countries, without intervention, 50–90% of children with SCD will die in childhood, mostly due to infection/sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 21\\]</u>, often before the diagnosis of SCD is made. There is no increased mortality in children with severe malaria when they also have sickle cell anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Worldwide, we also have a genetic explanation for different ways of presentation, as we know there are different haplotypes in different regions of the world. For example, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, there are two major clinical phenotypes. Patients from the Western Province have a severe course consistent with the Benin haplotype. They are prone to recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, and dactylitis and in general have a lower level of hemoglobin and hemoglobin F (HbF). They typically present early with painful crises. Patients from the Eastern Province have a milder course of disease; they act more like the Arab and Indian phenotypes. This is associated with higher levels of HbF and frequently a later date of the first presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>.\n\n【29】##### 3.2. Fetal Hemoglobin\n\n【30】HbF is a physiologic protein tetramer that is of major importance during fetal life. Its affinity for oxygen is higher than the mother’s hemoglobin and thereby facilitates the transfer of oxygen from maternal to fetal blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. A higher HbF level in the postnatal period is known to have a positive effect on the course of SCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 25–27\\]</u>. Patients with SCD and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) have a significantly milder phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> with a longer lifespan of the red blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. HbF prevents polymerization of HbS by reducing the concentration of HbS. The sufficient amount of HbF to prevent the clinical manifestations of SCD in vivo is not completely clarified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>, while in vitro studies suggest that 20% HbF is necessary to prevent polymerization of HbS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. In a cross-sectional single center study in Nigeria, it was found that stroke was related to lower levels of HbF; while on the other hand, complications such as priapism, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis or ulcers were not linked to lower levels of HbF. In this study, lower levels were mostly found in boys, which were not seen in adults. Possibly, a hormonal role during puberty is responsible. In addition, there is a relationship between the percentage of HbF and age, in which the percentage of HbF decreases with age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【31】A different explanation might be the haplotype of the disease. Senegal, Saudi, and Indian haplotypes are generally associated with higher levels of HbF and therefore known for a milder course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24–26\\]</u>. HbF is also increased in different inherited conditions, such as HPFH, hereditary spherocytosis, and thalassemia. Family studies suggest an inheritance that does not follow the Mendelian pattern. HbF levels are multifactorial, influenced with 89% of variability because of genetic factors, and the other is dependent on sex, age, and environmental factors. The level of HbF rises in several acquired states, such as pregnancy, aplastic anemia, thyrotoxicosis, hepatoma, myeloproliferative disorders, or hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【32】##### 3.3. Reticulocytes\n\n【33】The role of the reticulocyte in the pathophysiology of SCD is not fully understood and still understudied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The reticulocyte count is commonly used as a marker of the bone marrow’s response to hemolysis and anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 27\\]</u>. Under normal conditions, each second, the bone marrow produces about 2 million reticulocytes. In SCD, this can increase up to 20-fold due to hemolytic anemia. During this increased production, the bone marrow releases reticulocytes prematurely in the blood in order to meet the demands. As SCD is accompanied by chronic hemolysis, there is a continuous stress erythropoiesis and therefore a persistent reticulocytosis. These prematurely released reticulocytes are less rigid than the sickle cell, but they contribute to vasoocclusion due to their big size and membrane properties promoting adhesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The splenic dysfunction in SCD is responsible for the lack of removal of the reticulocytes, leading to an overrepresentation (up to 25%) of the reticulocytes of all circulating red blood cells. The benefit of these cells might not transcend the pathological consequences. Data and studies are lacking to identify a thorough link between reticulocytosis and disease severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【34】In infancy, in children with SCD, the physiologic anemia will show an exaggerated increase in the reticulocyte count and could be a marker for SCD. In the cooperative study of sickle cell disease, the absolute reticulocyte count above 200 000/µl in the age group 2–6 months was associated with a three-time risk for SCD-related events which needed hospitalization within the first three years of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 29, 30\\]</u>. Ambrose et al. showed in a prospective cohort study conducted in Tanzania that children with SCA and sickle β°-thalassemia had a lower Hb with a high red cell distribution width (RDW) at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, compared to carriers of sickle cell disease and sickle β<sup>+</sup>\\-thalassemia. The results of a simple blood test could suspect the presence of SCD already in this age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【35】##### 3.4. Genetic Modulators\n\n【36】Some genetic modulators of SCD severity are well known as concurrent α\\-thalassemia, fetal hemoglobin concentration, and ß\\-globin haplotype. Possible G6PD deficiency can have an impact on SCD. More recently, BCL11 A and HBS1L-MYP were added to the list 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【37】##### 3.5. SCD Genotype\n\n【38】While sickle cell anemia (HbSS) and sickle β<sup>0</sup>\\-thalassemia (HbS-β<sup>0</sup>) are responsible for more severe diseases; hemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) and sickle β⁺-thalassemia (HbS-β⁺) are common and in general, less severe presentations of SCD. HbSC is the most common type in the African American population in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. HbC does not polymerize, but it potentiates the polymerization of HbS by increasing the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. As the course is rather mild, the patients still can suffer from the classic vasoocclusive complications as priapism, splenic sequestration, and acute chest syndrome. HbSC patients rarely present with a stroke as they have higher hemoglobin levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>, but presumable, due to the higher blood viscosity, retinopathy is seen more often 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. HbS-β⁺ is milder with less severe pain crises and less severe splenic dysfunction. Therefore, the disease can present itself later in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. On the other hand, this genotype has a broad spectrum of phenotypes, and therefore, caution should be taken 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【39】##### 3.6. Alpha-Thalassemia\n\n【40】The decrease in α\\-globin chains in SCD reduces the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and, thereby, the polymerization within the RBC. Homozygous alpha-thalassemia decreases the oxidative stress in SCA and could be an explanation for the protected role of alpha-thalassemia from various hemolysis-related complications of SCA. In contrast, the rate of vasoocclusive events is not related to their oxidative stress level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. In 2014, Cox et al. reported in a study of 601 stroke-free Tanzanian SCA patients aged <24 years, the importance of alpha-thalassemia of reducing risk of abnormal cerebral blood flow velocity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Olatunya et al. performed a cross-sectional retrospective study on 100 young Nigerian patients with SCA and 63 controls. Their study confirms that coexistence of alpha-thalassemia with SCA significantly influences both the clinical and laboratory manifestations with increased bone pain crisis and protection against leg ulcers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.\n\n【41】##### 3.7. Fetal Hemoglobin Concentration\n\n【42】The Xmn1 polymorphism on chromosome 11p is the first genetic variant associated with increased levels of HbF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>, but it is assumed that additional factors are also necessary to have a clinical impact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Another gene linked to higher HbF levels is BCL11 A on chromosome 2p16. This is a transcriptional repressor of the γ\\-globin in helping control the developmental switch from embryonic to adult ß\\-globin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Variations in the BCL11 A binding site are found concurrent with HPFH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. The MYB transcription factor of the c\\-Myb gene on chromosome 6q23 is an important regulator of hematopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and HbF levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 38\\]</u>. Low MYB levels stimulate the erythroid differentiation, causing the release of larger cells expressing predominantly γ\\-globin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Using whole genome sequencing of many SCD genomes, many other HbF regulators will be identified. With all the acquired new data, it will be difficult to define and harmonize the variable phenotypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【43】##### 3.8. G6PD\n\n【44】There are conflicting data on the impact of concurrent G6PD deficiency on laboratory and clinical parameters of SCD. Belisario et al. investigated a cohort of 395 Brazilian children with SCA and demonstrated that G6PD molecular deficiency or enzyme activity was not associated either with clinical ischemic stroke or high-risk transcranial Doppler 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>, while Joly et al. studied 121 children with SCA and concluded that G6PD deficiency and absence of a\\-thalassemia increases the risk for cerebral vasculopathy in children with sickle cell anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. Antwi-Baffour et al. examined the blood of 120 SCD patients of genotypes HbSS and HbSC and found statistically significant differences between the Hb concentration of the participants having a G6PD deficiency (males) and those with normal G6PD activity (females), concluding that G6PD deficiency may increase the severity of anemia in SCD patients and therefore a possible earlier presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.\n\n【45】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【46】SCD is a well-studied but not completely understood entity. When no newborn screening has taken place, a child’s sickle cell disease can present for the first time in different ways and at different ages. Many factors are responsible for this. Familiarity and knowledge of SCD are of course essential with a low threshold for additional research (peripheral blood smear and Hb electrophoresis) to prevent delay of the diagnosis and performance of unnecessary tests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:08:36", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:08:57", "cost": 20.766}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:08:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:08:35"}

Although involvement of the thyroid gland by amyloid is a relatively common phenomenon, clinically significant enlargement of the thyroid owing to amyloid deposition is a rare occurrence. In SA, the deposition of amyloid associated (AA) protein is associated with atrophy of thyroid follicles.

Thyroid function is not impaired in most cases. Although amyloid goitre secondary to systemic amyloidosis due to chronic inflammatory diseases is relatively common, specifically related to RA is much more uncommon one and it is reported less in the literature.

Introduction\n\n【3】Amyloidosis refers to a variety of conditions in which amyloid proteins are abnormally deposited in organs and/or tissues. Primary amyloidosis (PA) arises from a disease with disordered immune cell function such as multiple myeloma and other immunocyte dyscrasias. Secondary (reactive) amyloidoses (SA) are those occurring as a complication of some other chronic inflammatory or tissue destructive diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that results in a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that may affect many tissues and organs.\n\n【4】The most common forms of systemic amyloidosis are PA of light chains and SA caused by chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. James first reported the presence of clinically detectable thyroid enlargement because of amyloid deposition in 1858, followed by Eiselberg in 1904, who later coined the term “amyloid goitre” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although involvement of the thyroid gland by amyloid is a relatively common phenomenon, clinically significant enlargement of the thyroid owing to amyloid deposition is an extremely rare occurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. It affects the thyroid in a bilateral and diffuse manner. Preoperatively it simulates a multinodular goitre and surgical intervention is often necessary to establish a diagnosis and to relieve compressive symptoms of a neck mass. Here, in this case report, a 52-old-year female patient with amyloid goiter associated with amyloidosis secondary to RA is presented.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】The patient was a 52-year-old woman that is referred to the general surgery clinic presenting with increasing dyspnea and a visible swelling at the base of the neck for the last two years. She had been diagnosed with RA six years ago but had not used the prescribed medication regularly. The thyroid gland was rough in palpation. In laboratory data, free T4: 1.26 ng/dL (N: 0.82–1.77 ng/dL), TSH: 0.243 mIU/mL (N: 0.27–4.2 mIU/mL), and thyroid autoantibodies such as Anti-TPO (antithyroid peroxidase) and anti-Tg (antithyroglobulin) were found to be negative. Other laboratory findings were WBC: 8000, Hb: 9.6 g/DL, Hct: 29.4%, MCV: 89.3 fL, Plt: 216000 μL, urea: 89 md/dL, and creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL, and hepatic function tests were found to be normal. Both of the thyroid lobes were enlarged in the ultrasound examination. In the right lobe, we found smooth, multiple nodules of 45–50 mm size that contained cystic degeneration areas. Biopsy specimens driven by fine needle aspiration did not show any malignant findings. Renal ultrasound examination revealed grade II nephropathy. Total thyroidectomy was performed because of the evident pressure symptoms. Thyroid tissue was found to be very rough and the histopathological examination revealed that macroscopically the right lobe was 12 × 6 × 5 cm in size and contained four nodules of 45–50 mm size. The size of the left lobe was 10 × 6 × 5 cm and the whole material was in pale grey-brown colour. The resected material was stained with haematoxylin-eosin dye and revealed an expansive amorphous eosinophilic substance deposition and lipid infiltration in the whole thyroid gland . An adenomatous hyperplasia was also found in the right lobe. On Congo red dye staining, amyloid deposition was stained red in the interstitial space and it showed an apple-green birefringence with the polarizing microscope . Amyloid deposition was sensitive to alkaline (potassium permanganate), causing fading of the stain. In the postoperative 16th month, chronic renal failure occurred and haemodialysis treatment was started. Nine months later, the patient died of myocardial infarction.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Expansive amorphous eosinophilic substance deposition and lipid infiltration in the whole thyroid gland (HE ×200). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Amyloid deposition stained red in the interstitial space and apple-green birefringence with the polarizing microscope (Kongo ×100). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】The preoperative diagnosis of amyloid goiter should be considered in patients with known systemic amyloidosis or with a long-standing predisposing disease who present a rapidly growing thyroid volume in association with an euthyroid state.\n\n【11】In our patient, amyloid goiter probability had been considered but because of the evident pressure symptoms, after FNA examination, surgery was performed rather than diagnosing a systemic amyloidosis preoperatively. In the literature, there are findings about the decreasing in the symptoms and amyloid goiter after treatment of the primary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【12】In autopsy studies, amyloid material is found in the thyroid gland of 80% of patients with SA and 50% of patients with PA. In a study, a systematic review of the published data on amyloid goiter was carried out for the period from 1951 to March 2008. A total of 127 publications (case series, single-case reports, and reviews) were found, of which 31 were case series published from February 1995 to March 2008 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Although involvement of the thyroid gland by amyloid is a relatively common phenomenon, clinically significant enlargement of the thyroid owing to amyloid deposition is a rare occurrence. Although it is very rare, in some cases isolated thyroid amyloidosis may be seen as chronic inflammatory diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the present case, high levels of urea and creatinine preoperatively and the necessity of haemodialysis postoperatively because of chronic renal failure make us think that the amyloidosis was systemic in the patient. Unfortunately, we had not performed renal biopsy.\n\n【13】In every patient with RA who is presenting with symptoms of goitre, amyloid goitre must be taken into consideration.

A 23-year-old male had a giant-cell tumor occurred in the distal end of the ulna. After wide resection of the distal segment of the ulna including giant-cell tumor, ulnar components of the wrist joint were reconstructed with modified Sauvé-Kapandji procedure using the iliac bone graft, preserving the triangular fibrocartilage complex and ulnar collateral ligament in order to maintain ulnar support of the wrist, and the proximal stump of the resected ulna was stabilized by tenodesis using the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon. One year after operation, the patient's wrist was pain-free and had a full range of motion. Postoperative X-rays showed no abnormal findings including recurrence of the giant-cell tumor and ulnar translation of the entire carpus. The stability of the proximal stump of the distal ulna was also maintained.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Giant-cell tumor (GCT) of the bone is a rare, benign, and locally invasive tumor. It is accounting for about 3% to 5% of all primary bone tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. GCTs of the bone usually occur at the epiphysis of the long bone such as femur, tibia, humerus, and radius. GCTs occurred at the distal end of the ulna are extremely rare, accounting for 0.45% to 3.2% of all the cases of GCTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This paper described a young male with a GCT of the distal end of the ulna treated by a wide resection and ulnar support reconstruction of the wrist.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 23-year-old male, manual laborer, noticed a movemental pain and swelling around the ulnar head of the left wrist on January, 2008. Pain suddenly increased two months after the onset without any particular event. The patient was seen to a clinic on March, 2008. In there, the patient was informed that there was an abnormal shadow in the ulnar head of the left wrist. There was no history of any other swelling in the body, fever, and loss of weight. The patient was introduced and first seen in our hospital on May, 2008.\n\n【6】Physical examinations revealed that there was an oval swelling of 4 × 3  cm in the distal end of the ulna. There was no color change and redness on the overlying skin. The swelling was diffusely tender and uniformly elastically hard. There was no adherence of the skin to the under lying bone. The range of motion of the patient’s left wrist was limited to 60° (contralateral side: 80°) in dorsiflexion and 50° (80°) in palmar flexion, 60° (90°) in pronation and 80° (90°) in supination. Moderate movemental pain was present at the extremes in all directions. The grip strength of his nondominant left wrist showed 27 kgf compared with 42 kgf of the unaffected dominant hand.\n\n【7】Blood examinations were within normal limits. Plain X-ray of the left ulna showed an expansile, multilobular, and radiolucent lesion with a clear margin, so-called soap-bubbled appearance lesion at the distal end with absence of periosteal reaction and incomplete fracture . Other X-rays including chest showed no abnormality. Computed tomograms showed thinning and protrusion of the cortex, but no destruction of the cortex of the distal ulna . Magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a low intensity in T1 weighted image and a relatively high intensity in T2 weighted image. A clinical diagnosis of GCT was made. Therefore, open biopsy was performed to make an accurate diagnosis. Histological findings revealed that the tumor was consisted of mononuclear tumor cells with eosinophilic oval and short fusiform nucleus and osteoclastic multinuclear giant cells, indicating typical benign GCT of the bone. On the basis of clinical and radiographic evaluations, the lesion was graded as stage 3 (aggressive) as per the Enneking Staging system for benign bone tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Preoperative plain X-ray showed an expansile, multilobular, and radiolucent lesion with a clear margin in the distal end of the left ulna. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Computed tomogram showed thinning and protrusion of the cortex but no destruction of the cortex of the distal ulna. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【10】Reconstructive surgery with tumor resection was performed under general anesthesia six weeks after his first visit to our hospital. The distal ulna including healthy proximal bone was resected en bloc to preserve the origin at the ulnar fovea of the triangular fibrocartilage with the ulnar collateral ligament. Iliac bone was harvested from the contralateral iliac crest by using separate instruments and was grafted to the ulnar side of the sigmoid notch of the radius-like Sauvé-Kapandji procedure. The grafted iliac bone was fixed with a small cannulated cortical screw and a 1.5 mm diameter Kirschner wire . The triangular fibrocartilage with the ulnar collateral ligament, which had been preserved, was attached to the distal radial aspect of the grafted iliac bone in order to reconstruct the ulnar support.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Iliac bone was grafted to the sigmoid notch of the radius.

The cut end of the proximal stump of the ulna was smoothed with a rongeur and rasp. A 3.5 mm hole was drilled from the dorsoulnar aspect of the ulnar shaft into the intramedullary cavity. The extensor carpi ulnaris tendon was split in the central sulcus and the radial half was released at the ulnocarpal level. It was then reflected proximally, leaving it attached at the musculotendinous junction. This proximally based slip, approximately six to eight cm long, was then passed into the medullary canal through the drill hole, retrieved at the distal stump of the ulna, and then sutured back on itself in an interlacing fashion. Final pathological examination confirmed a benign giant-cell tumor (Grade II).\n\n【13】A long arm splint was applied for two weeks, after which gentle active motion of the wrist and forearm was encouraged. Bony fusion between the radius and grafted ilium was confirmed on X-ray films eight weeks after the operation. Full range of motion in all directions was allowed and encouraged.\n\n【14】The patient’s wrist was free from pain one year after the operation, the range of motion of the wrist was full (90° in dorsiflexion, 80° in volar flexion, 90° in pronation, and 90° in supination), and the grip strength was improved to 37 kgf. The stability of the proximal stump of the distal ulna was also maintained. X-rays of the patient’s left wrist showed no recurrence of the tumor, no absorption of the grafted bone, and no ulnar translation of the entire carpus. There was no convergence of the proximal stump of the ulna toward the radius . Chest X-ray showed no metastases in the lung.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | One year after the operation, X-ray showed no recurrence of the tumor, no absorption of the grafted bone, and no ulnar translation of the entire carpus.

Discussion\n\n【17】Giant-cell tumor (GCT) of bone is a rare and essentially benign tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. GCT occurred in the ulnar epiphysis is furthermore extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There has been an intralesional curettage with bone or artificial material graft or en bloc resection in the treatment of a low-grade GCT of the distal ulnar end. Resection of the distal end of the ulna, so-called the Darrach’s operation, is a simple and easy solution but long-term results are still unpredictable, especially with high stress manual labor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. This may be attributed to abnormal stress distribution after resection of the distal ulna.\n\n【18】Resection of the distal ulnar end is most commonly performed for disorders of the distal radioulnar joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–12\\]</u>. Long-term results of the Darrach’s procedure are not predictable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Ulnar carpal translation and snapping of the distal ulnar end and finger extensor tendon rupture due to instability of the ulna may occur as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The Sauvé-Kapandji procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6, 14\\]</u> and radiolunate fusion have been used for reconstruction to prevent ulnar translation of the entire carpus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, there are many problems including the necessity of a healthy distal end of the ulna and an unacceptable decrease in range of motion of the wrist after these surgeries.\n\n【19】Goal for our young active patient was to preserve as much wrist instability and movement as possible. Hashizume et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> used a longer iliac bone graft to achieve the buttress effect against axial stress loading, hence the term “ulnar buttress arthroplasty”. Our method should be called a modification procedure described by them.\n\n【20】Excessive resection of the distal ulna usually results in painful instability of the stump or a click 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–20\\]</u>. In the present case, the distal stump of the ulna after resection of the distal ulna including GCT lesion was stabilized by the method previously reported in our papers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【21】In conclusion, our procedure is useful for the ulnar support reconstruction after wide resection of the distal ulna including ulnar head.

Fecal abscess or enterocutaneous fistulas of the scrotum are rare and are invariably the result of incarcerated bowel loop in inguinal hernia. Spontaneous perforation of the colon (SPC) having no definite cause is also rare. Much rarer is posterior colonic perforations causing an extensively large retroperitoneal abscess. Similarly, spread of retroperitoneal abscess to the thigh or scrotum has rarely been reported. We report a case of spontaneous posterior perforation of ascending colon resulting in large retroperitoneal abscess eventually causing scrotal abscess, which resolved on conservative treatment and drainage of the scrotal fecal abscess. Case Presentation. A 20-year-old male presented with gradually increasing noncolicky pain right side abdomen with nonprojectile vomiting, obstipation, and progressive abdominal distension. Clinically, the abdomen was tender with guarding over the right side with signs of inflammation on the right side back with no associated hernia. On conservative treatment, he was gradually improved but developed right side scrotal abscess a week later. CT abdomen showed a large retroperitoneal collection having multiple internal air lucencies, displacing ascending colon and caecum medically with discontinuity in the posterior wall of ascending colon. The large retroperitoneal collection was extending from right pararenal and posterior perihepatic soft tissue planes to the right iliac fossa and thigh. On drainage of the scrotal abscess, about 350 ml of fecal contents was evacuated. The patient gradually recovered and was discharged on conservative treatment with an uneventful 4-year follow-up. Conclusion. Diagnosis of retroperitoneal perforation of the colon is often delayed due to the absence of peritoneal irritation. An extensively large retroperitoneal abscess may spread the infection to the scrotum and thigh due to extreme pressure, possibly by dissecting away the transversalis fascia through a deep ring along the side of the spermatic cord. Timely performed CT/MRI can avoid delay in the diagnosis of retroperitoneal abscess and further spread of infection.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Enterocutaneous fistula of the scrotum is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and is almost exclusively due to incarcerated bowel loop in inguinal hernia. Spontaneous perforation of the colon (SPC) is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u> and is defined as perforation of a normal colon without any contributing factor such as disease of the bowel or hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The retroperitoneal colonic perforations are rare causes of a retroperitoneal abscess and are exclusively seen in frail elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. No case of spontaneous retroperitoneal perforation of ascending colon causing an abscess or enterocutaneous fistula of the scrotum in the absence of hernia has been ever reported to the best of our knowledge in indexed literature. We describe our unique case of a 20-year-old male with spontaneous retroperitoneal perforation of ascending colon resulting in initially retroperitoneal abscess, later converting to scrotal fecal abscess, managed with conservative treatment and drainage of the abscess.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 20-year-old male presented to the emergency department complaining of gradually increasing noncolicky pain right side abdomen with multiple episodes of nonprojectile vomiting, obstipation, and progressive abdominal distension for the past 3 days. There was fever with chills and rigor for a similar duration. There was no past history of chronic constipation. There was no personal or family history of tuberculosis. At the time of presentation, the patient was having a pulse rate of 110 beats/minute, a blood pressure of 120/82 mm Hg, and a temperature of 39.5° Celsius. During the abdominal examination, there was tenderness and guarding over the right side of the abdomen with signs of inflammation on the right side back. There was no associated inguinal hernia. On auscultation, bowel sounds were sluggish.\n\n【6】Blood investigations revealed haemoglobin of 11 gm/dL, white cell count of 10,900/cumm with 80% polymorphs, 16% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes, and 2% eosinophil. Liver function test, renal function test, serum electrolyte, serum glucose, and urine analysis were all normal. Typhi antigen card test was negative.\n\n【7】Abdominal X-ray in the erect position showed the right side minimal pleural effusions with dilated loops of the small bowel. Ultrasonography (USG) of the abdomen reported multiple fluid distended intestinal loops suspecting paralytic ileus/subacute intestinal obstruction. The patient was kept on conservative treatment with Ryle’s tube suction, intravenous fluids, and parenteral antibiotics. By the 4<sup>th</sup> day of conservative treatment, the patient started passing flatus and feces and was gradually shifted to a liquid diet.\n\n【8】On the 8<sup>th</sup> day of admission, the patient complained of painful swelling right scrotum. Scrotal examination showed signs of inflammation with fluctuation on the right side. CT scan of the abdomen showed discontinuity in the posterior wall of ascending colon with a large retroperitoneal collection having multiple internal air lucencies, displacing ascending colon and caecum medically. The right retroperitoneal collection extending superiorly from right pararenal and posterior perihepatic soft tissue planes to the right iliac fossa and right thigh .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT scan abdomen with oral contrast showed a large retroperitoneal collection with multiple air lucencies displacing ascending colon and caecum medially.

The fecal discharge gradually started decreasing while the patient was continued on a liquid diet . The cellulitis of the right side back was also started decreasing. On the 26th day of admission, the patient was discharged in satisfactory condition with no discharge from the scrotal wound. 4-year follow-up was uneventful.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Scrotal wound 5<sup>th</sup> day following drainage of fecal contents.</u>\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Almost all fecal abscesses/enterocutaneous fistulas of the scrotum are due to incarcerated bowel loop in inguinal hernia. Paediatric age is the prominent group for these abscess/fistula, while adults are comparatively spared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】After extensive research of indexed literature, we find 33 cases of enterocutaneous fistula/fecal abscess of the scrotum, labia, or inguinal region. In our review, we found that the fecal fistulas/abscesses were either present in below 40 days of age (13 cases, mostly neonates) or above the age of 20 years (17 cases, mostly above 40 years of age) . The inguinal hernia was present in all cases except ours, where there was no hernia present. All except two (who refused to operate) were managed by exploratory laparotomy and anastomosis of disrupted bowel, while our case was managed by conservative treatment along with incision & drainage of the scrotal fecal abscess.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Review of literature of enterocutaneous fistula (ECF)/fecal abscess of the scrotum.</u>\n\n【16】Spontaneous perforation of the colon (SPC) is a perforation of the normal colon in the absence of a pathological cause such as tumours, diverticulosis, or external injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Colonic perforations are mostly encountered in diverticulitis, carcinoma colon, inflammatory bowel disease, trauma, foreign body insertion, and iatrogenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. The cause of spontaneous colonic perforation is unclear. Hard feces present in patients with chronic constipation compress the colonic wall resulting in diminished blood supply, which may lead to significant feculent ulcer following ischemia and necrosis of colonic mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The posterior colonic perforations are rare causes of retroperitoneal abscess and are relatively seen in frail elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The retroperitoneum, a potential space with clearly defined boundaries between the peritoneum and the transversalis fascia, can be seeded by infections involving surrounding organs such as kidneys, pancreas, colon, duodenum, bladder, uterus, and rectum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. Perforations of bowel in retroperitoneal spaces usually presented with unspecific symptomatology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>, where pyrexia of unknown origin is a common presentation. Less commonly, it may present with pain in the lower back, hip, or thigh. Other symptoms that may be present include malaise, anorexia, and weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>, or painful inguinal swellings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Though it is not the common course, retroperitoneal abscesses may rarely extend to the thigh or scrotum, and such abscesses may be missed to diagnosed for as long as two weeks from the onset of abdominal pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Infection and air that has developed in retroperitoneal space due to pathology of surrounding organs are contained by transversalis fascia but may rarely dissect away through a deep inguinal ring alongside the spermatic cord in males and the round ligament in women, respectively, to reach scrotum and grand labia when there is tremendous pressure due to their massive size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41, 42\\]</u>. The pathophysiological mechanism involved is the emergence of a pressure gradient between the peritoneum and surrounding structures, causing rupture of the perianal tissue, allowing gas from a perforation to diffuse along tissue planes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. In our case also, the retroperitoneal abscess was very extensive, occupying almost all possible retroperitoneal space of the right side extending to the thigh and ipsilateral scrotum.\n\n【19】The diagnostic sensitivity of ultrasonography for retroperitoneal abscesses is 67%–87%. CT has a sensitivity ranging from 90% to 100%, while MRI has a sensitivity ranging from 88.5% to 100% in diagnosing retroperitoneal abscesses, and both are reliable investigations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Further, we found only 12 cases of spontaneous perforation of the colon (SPC) but no case of spontaneous retroperitoneal perforation of ascending colon, or any case of fecal abscess/enterocutaneous fistula of the scrotum in the absence of inguinal hernia and no case of retroperitoneal fecal abscess reaching scrotum in indexed literature. Spontaneous retroperitoneal perforation of ascending colon resulting in retroperitoneal abscess and eventually ending into scrotal fecal abscess in the absence of inguinal hernia was albeit a surprisingly rare case reported in the literature.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】Pneumoscrotum and fecal abscess of the scrotum are an extremely rare presentation of retroperitoneal colonic perforation, especially in the absence of inguinal hernia. Diagnosis of retroperitoneal perforation of the colon is often delayed due to the absence of peritoneal irritation. Our experience suggests that, due to extreme pressure, an extensively large retroperitoneal abscess may spread the infection to the scrotum and thigh possibly by dissecting away the transversalis fascia through a deep ring along the side of the spermatic cord. CT scan or MRI performed in undiagnosed case of the acute abdomen can avoid delay in the diagnosis of a retroperitoneal abscess, as well as further spread of infection.\n\n【23】#### Abbreviations\n\n| SPC: | Spontaneous perforation of the colon |\n| --- | --- |\n| USG: | Ultrasonography |\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| I&D: | Incision & drainage |\n| ECF: | Enterocutaneous fistula. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:06:34", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:06:48", "cost": 14.069}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:06:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:06:33"}

It is well recognized that squamous cell carcinomas of the lung and esophagus can cause humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy secondary to paraneoplastic secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide. However, it is extremely rare for a squamous cell carcinoma developing in a sacral decubitus ulcer to cause humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. We describe the first case of a patient found to have elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone related peptide related to his Marjolin’s ulcer. A 45-year-old African American man with T6 paraplegia and a sacral decubitus ulcer present for 20 years was admitted for hypercalcemia of unclear etiology. He was subsequently found to have elevated parathyroid hormone related peptide and an excisional biopsy from the ulcer showed invasive squamous cell carcinoma suggestive of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The patient ultimately succumbed to sepsis while receiving chemotherapy for his metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is a rare and likely underrecognized complication that can occur in a Marjolin’s ulcer.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】A Marjolin’s ulcer is defined as malignant transformation occurring in long-standing burns, fissures, and ulcers. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is an important paraneoplastic syndrome occurring in humans with a wide variety of cancers. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) was originally isolated from specific tumors as the primary cause of HHM and is overexpressed by many types of neoplasms. While it has been well recognized that SCC of the lung and esophagus can secrete PTHrP causing HHM, it is rare for a cutaneous SCC to result in HHM with only six reported cases in the literature. We report the first case of a patient with a long-standing sacral decubitus ulcer found to have humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy secondary to the ulcer’s transformation to an SCC. This report underscores the importance of maintaining a high level of clinical suspicion for the possibility of a Marjolin’s ulcer in a patient who presents with elevated PTHrP and no other evidence of malignancy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Laboratory Measurements\n\n【6】All laboratory serum specimens were evaluated either at New York Presbyterian-Columbia Hospital (calcium and PTH) (New York, NY) or ARUP laboratories (PTHrP) (Salt Lake City, UT).\n\n【7】##### 2.2. Histology\n\n【8】The skin specimen was routinely processed after fixation with formaldehyde and stained with hematoxylin and eosin at the Dermatopathology Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Results and Discussion\n\n【10】A 45-year-old African-American man with T6 paraplegia was admitted for malaise, weight loss, and a sacral decubitus ulcer for 20 years duration. The sacral decubitus ulcer had failed topical wound care and 6 split thickness skin grafts. On admission, he had hypercalcemia (15.4 mg/dL, normal range 8.7–10.2) with low vitamin D 25-OH (18 ng/mL, normal range 30–80), undetectable parathyroid hormone (PTH), and elevated parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) to 40 pg/mL (normal range 14–27). Cutaneous examination demonstrated a 16 × 27.5 cm friable ulcer with fibrinopurulent exudate covering the sacrum and buttocks with exposure of muscle and bone .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | 16 × 27.5 cm friable ulcer with fibrinopurulent exudate and exophytic, granulation tissue centrally and peripherally. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated soft tissue masses with bony destruction of the iliac spines and the L4 vertebral body . An excisional biopsy of the sacral ulcer was performed which showed epidermal erosion and irregular nests and cords of dysplastic keratinocytes infiltrating the dermis . Fine needle aspiration of the inguinal node showed malignant cells. The neoplastic cells were positive for pancytokeratin, CK5/6, and p63. They were negative for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, CDX-2, PSA, and HPV. The morphology and immunostaining patterns were compatible with squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated soft tissue masses with bony destruction of the iliac spines (green lines demarcate bony metastases). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Histopathologic examination with hematoxylin-eosin staining showed epidermal erosion and irregular nests and cords of dysplastic keratinocytes infiltrating the dermis. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【15】The patient refused surgical management and radiation therapy. He was started on cetuximab. Following the third dose, he developed sepsis, was readmitted, and ultimately succumbed to septic shock 1.5 months after the initial dermatology consult. Autopsy showed extensive involvement of the superficial and deep tissues of the lower back, sacrum, buttocks, lower abdomen, groin, upper thighs, and perineum by a high grade SCC with direct extension into the abdominal cavity and marked destruction of the bony pelvis and femoral heads. Lymph node and pulmonary metastases were also identified.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Marjolin’s ulcer, first described by the late French surgeon Jean-Nicolas Marjolin in 1828, is the malignant transformation of long-standing burns, fissures, and ulcers, including leprous neurotrophic ulcers, and other chronically inflamed tissue processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most commonly associated malignancy is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) but other neoplasms including basal cell carcinoma and sarcomas have been described. The time necessary for malignant transformation of a sacral decubitus ulcer ranged from 20 to 70 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Abnormalities of calcium homeostasis are an uncommon complication of Marjolin’s ulcer. The amino terminus of parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) has significant homology to human parathyroid hormone (PTH) which allows it to bind to PTH/PTHrP kidney and bone receptors resulting in humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Hypercalcemia occurs because tumor-produced PTHrP interacts with the renal and bone PTH/PTHrP receptor. In the kidney, PTHrP stimulates phosphate excretion and reabsorption of calcium in the distal collecting ducts. In the skeleton, PTHrP induces osteoclastic bone resorption, resulting in elevation of the serum calcium concentration. All normal squamous cells can secrete PTHrP but only certain squamous cell tumors result in hypercalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is surprising that despite the high incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, hypercalcemia is an extremely rare complication of this neoplasm. Indeed, hypercalcemia associated with cutaneous SCC has been reported in fifteen cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. Of those fifteen patients, six were found to have increased PTHrP levels strongly supporting the diagnosis of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, there have been only three published case reports of Marjolin’s ulcer associated with hypercalcemia. In one Marjolin’s ulcer case, serum levels of PTHrP were normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>. We describe the first case of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy secondary to a Marjolin’s ulcer. While the bony destruction from the SCC in our case may have contributed to the patient’s hypercalcemia, the finding of concomitantly elevated PTHrP strongly supports the paraneoplastic production of PTHrP as the primary cause of his hypercalcemia. Based on these findings, we recommend surveillance biopsies of long-standing sacral decubitus ulcers in patients found to have hypercalcemia and elevated PTHrP with no known malignancy.\n\n【19】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【20】HHM is a rare and likely underrecognized complication that can occur in a Marjolin’s ulcer. Based on this case report and past literature, we recommend surveillance biopsies of long-standing decubitus ulcers to look for malignant transformation to SCC in patients who are found to be hypercalcemic with elevated PTHrP and no other evidence of malignancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:37:46", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:37:53", "cost": 7.223}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:37:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:37:45"}

Clinical B<sub>12</sub> deficiency with hematological or neurological manifestations is rare. An unusual manifestation of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytosis and only occurs in 2.5% of those with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Pseudo-TMA is misdiagnosed as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in 40% of cases, resulting in misguided treatment including plasmapheresis. Case. A 44-year-old Hispanic presented with 3 weeks of progressively worsening non-radiating chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath (SOB). Laboratory findings revealed severe pancytopenia and macrocytosis with a hemoglobin of 5.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 116.3 fL, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> low at 149 pg/mL. She was diagnosed with pseudo-TMA and after starting 1000 micrograms of parenteral vitamin B<sub>12</sub> injections daily and discontinuing plasmapheresis and steroid administration, she improved. Conclusion. Failure to recognize pseudo-TMA often results in unnecessary treatment with plasmapheresis and delays appropriate treatment with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation. It is therefore extremely important to consider pseudo-TMA as a differential diagnosis in patients that present with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> plays an important role in hematopoiesis and neurological function. Clinical manifestations of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency include megaloblastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis, and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Clinical B<sub>12</sub> deficiency with hematological or neurological manifestations is rare, but subclinical B<sub>12</sub> deficiency has an incidence of 2.5–26% in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Pernicious anemia is the most common cause of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in the world and is caused by anti-intrinsic factor or anti-parietal cell antibodies, resulting in impaired B<sub>12</sub> absorption in the terminal ileum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A rare manifestation of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytosis and only occurs in 2.5% of those with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Due to the rarity of pseudo-TMA, approximately 38.8% of cases are misdiagnosed as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), resulting in misguided treatment including plasmapheresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Here, we present a rare cause of pseudo-TMA caused by B<sub>12</sub> deficiency secondary to undiagnosed pernicious anemia.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 44-year-old Hispanic female with a PMH including insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with 3 weeks of progressively worsening non-radiating chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath (SOB). She stated the chest pain was diffuse and that both the chest pain and SOB were worsened with exertion. She also complained of melena, gum bleeding while brushing her teeth, nausea, and loss of taste, but denied fevers, chills, hemoptysis, weight loss, numbness or tingling, diarrhea, or confusion. She reported no tobacco or illicit drug use but did describe drinking 1-2 glasses of wine per week. Her family history was significant for myelodysplastic syndrome in her mother. Initial vital signs were unremarkable aside from being slightly hypertensive to 138/92. Physical examination revealed an obese body habitus, conjunctival pallor, and multiple ecchymoses on her bilateral lower extremities, but did not reveal hepatosplenomegaly or any neurological deficits.\n\n【6】Laboratory findings revealed severe pancytopenia and macrocytosis, hemoglobin (hgb) of 5.4 g/dL (grams per deciliter) (11.6–15 g/dL), hematocrit of 16.4%, mean corpuscular volume of 116.3 fL, (femtoliters) (80–100 (fL), white blood cell count of 3.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL (cells per microliter) (5.0–10.0 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL), and a platelet count of 28,000/µL (per microliter of blood) (150,000–450,000 platelets/µL. The differential revealed a moderate amount of macrocytes, schistocytes, and teardrop cells. Her troponin I was unremarkable at <0.03 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter), and her comprehensive metabolic panel revealed normal bilirubin level of 1.0 mg/dL (0.1–1.2 mg/dL milligrams per deciliter) and mildly elevated AST to 52 U/L (units per liter) (10–40 U/L). Her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was also elevated at 1,647 IU/L (international units per liter) (140–280 IU/L) and haptoglobin decreased (<30.0 mg/dL) (41–165 mg/dL), and peripheral blood smear showed macrocytic normochromic anemia with severe anisopoikilocytosis, frequent schistocytes, and occasional tear drop cells, and no hypersegmented neutrophils were noted. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no splenomegaly or any evidence of neoplastic disease. Disseminated intravascular coagulation profile revealed a normal prothrombin time test (PT) of 11.2 seconds, normal fibrinogen of 349 mg/dL (200–400 mg/dL), and a slightly reduced activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 24.6 seconds. The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with improvement in hgb to 7.3 g/dL, and hematology was promptly consulted due to concern for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient was started on 100 mg prednisone due to a concern for possible autoimmune hemolytic anemia process and was started on daily plasmapheresis on day 1 of hospitalization.\n\n【7】During the first 2 days of hospitalization, further testing revealed ADAMTS13 level within normal limits at 85% activity, antinuclear antibody (ANA) screen negative, and flow cytometry revealed no paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone. ADAMTS13 is a key metalloproteinase enzyme that functions in regulating clotting. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate levels revealed low B<sub>12</sub> (149 pg/mL) (picograms per milliliter) (190–950 (pg/mL) and a normal folate level at 17.5 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) (3–13 (ng/mL). She had no improvement in her pancytopenia or symptoms with 2 days of plasmapheresis, and decision was made to initiate 1000 mcg (micrograms) of parenteral cyanocobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) injections daily and stop plasmapheresis and steroid administration. The patient’s blood counts in all cell lines began to improve after administration of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and her symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea on exertion improved. To evaluate the cause of her B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, anti-parietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies were collected, and both returned positive. Serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels were elevated at 23 umol/mL (micromoles per milliliter) (normal range: 0.00-0.40 umol/mL) and >50 umol/L (normal range: 5-15 umol/L), respectively. Her final diagnosis was pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathic anemia (pseudo-TMA) secondary to pernicious anemia, and the patient was discharged home with monthly B<sub>12</sub> injections and follow-up in the hematology clinic in 2 months.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin) serves an essential physiological role as a cofactor in DNA/RNA synthesis and homocysteine metabolism. B<sub>12</sub> deficiency can lead to ineffective hematopoiesis and demyelination, which classically presents with pancytopenia, megaloblastic anemia, hypersegmented neutrophils, and dorsal column dysfunction. In adults, the most common etiology is autoimmune pernicious anemia, in which case autoantibodies against the intrinsic factor-B<sub>12</sub> complex impairs absorption. Other causes include inadequate dietary intake, malabsorptive causes, and genetic etiologies. Cobalamin metabolism defect (Cbl C) is an autosomal recessive disorder of intracellular cobalamin processing caused by mutations in Mmachc gene. Generally these inherited defects are diagnosed early in life, and, in fact, many newborn screening programs can detect Cbl C 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【10】In a rare 10% of cases, cobalamin deficiency can present with hemolysis. The pathophysiology is still poorly understood, but two proposed mechanisms involve intermedullary hemolysis and hyperhomocysteinemia. Intermedullary hemolysis occurs due to fragile RBC membranes, which cause them to shear before they reach the peripheral circulation. Elevated homocysteine levels have been shown to downregulate the activity of glutathione peroxidase, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species that damage the endothelium and further lyse the already fragile RBCs. When hemolytic anemia is associated with thrombocytopenia and schistocytes in the setting of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, the triad is termed pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy (PTMA). This is an extremely rare presentation of B12 deficiency that is only seen in 2.5% of cases.\n\n【11】Importantly, the hemolysis seen in cobalamin deficiency occurs in the absence of intravascular platelet aggregates or microthrombi, which is the defining hallmark of a group of disorders termed thrombotic microangiopathies. The most common causes of thrombotic microangiopathies include diffuse intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and hemolytic uremia syndrome (HUS). TTP is of particular importance as it shares the same triad of laboratory findings as PTMA. Fever, neurological findings, and renal damage may also be present in TTP but are not necessarily required for diagnosis. TTP is a medical emergency that is almost always fatal without prompt initiation of treatment. Therefore, up to 39% of PTMA patients are initially misdiagnosed with TTP. This occurred in our clinical case, as our patient was started on empiric plasmapheresis until ADAMTS came back at a normal value and we considered other differentials.\n\n【12】Studies comparing PTMA with TTP have helped elucidate additional differences between the two diagnoses. PTMA is associated with very elevated LDH levels, mild bilirubin elevations, high MCV, low reticulocyte counts, and a Coombs-positive pernicious anemia in a majority of cases. Markedly elevated LDH occurs from hemolysis of nucleated RBCs and would therefore not be expected in TTP as the mature RBCs being lysed are anucleate. Similarly, erythroid progenitors produce smaller amounts of hemoglobin and cause mild bilirubin elevation. Macrocytosis coupled with low reticulocytes is due to ineffective erythropoiesis from B12 deficiency. This combination in particular is suggestive of PTMA as opposed to TTP. Finally, TTP would present with a Coombs-negative anemia as it is not an autoimmune etiology. When looking back at our clinical case, all of these subtle signatures can be seen.\n\n【13】Once the diagnosis of PTMA is made, treatment is B12 supplementation. Most patients respond to therapy with resolution of lab abnormalities and clinical symptoms.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】Pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy is an extremely rare clinical manifestation of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency that results from shearing of red blood cells (RBCs) in the absence of microthrombi due to inherent RBC fragility. In contrast to thrombotic microangiopathies, reticulocyte count is low in pseudo-TMA due to limited B<sub>12</sub> reserves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Given the rarity of the disease, pseudo-TMA is often not considered early in the workup of a suspected microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Failure to recognize pseudo-TMA often results in unnecessary treatment with plasmapheresis and delays appropriate treatment with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation. It is therefore extremely important to consider pseudo-TMA as a differential diagnosis in patients that present with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:05:30", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:06:06", "cost": 35.749}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:06:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:05:29"}

What Is Your Diagnosis?\n\n【9】##### 2.1. Diagnosis: Human Orf (Ecthyma Contagiosum)\n\n【10】Case Synopsis  \nA 61-year-old sheep farmer presented with a painful nonpruritic ulcerated lesion on the left hand that had been present for approximately 5 weeks. He neither had previous history of similar lesions nor did he have a history of cancer or other dermatologic conditions. Physical examination demonstrated a 1 cm pearly, umbilicated papule with raised borders .  \nA biopsy  showed an asymmetrical nodule with parakeratotic crust and acanthosis with thin epidermal strands extending deeply in the underlying dermis. The upper dermis showed marked edema and capillary proliferation. The deeper dermal part of the lesion showed extensive lymphocytic infiltration. One red intranuclear inclusion was identified in the epidermal keratinocyte .\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Our patient was a sheep farmer who presented with a raised umbilicated pearly lesion of his left hand that was ulcerated with raised borders. Clinically, it could easily be mistaken for a basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The central umbilication could also suggest keratoacanthoma or a lesion caused by molluscum infection though such lesions are usually much smaller. Milker’s nodules should be considered too. Both the clinical history of sheep farming and the microscopic features including the eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion body in the keratinocyte suggest a diagnosis of human orf (ecthyma contagiosum). The diagnosis may be further confirmed by electron microscopy done on the fluid obtained from the orf lesion showing ovoid cross-hatched virions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), although not readily available, can definitely identify orf virus from frozen tissue specimens, vesicle material, or scab debris from orf lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Ecthyma contagiosum is a zoonotic disease caused by the parapoxvirus that causes “sore mouth” in sheep and goats and orf in human. In ruminants, it is evidenced by exudative lesions found on the muzzle, eyelids, oral cavity, feet, or external genitalia. It is more common in younger animals. The disease in ruminants is highly contagious to humans and other animals; infected sheep and also freshly vaccinated sheep or goats are the source of infection to people. Transmission can be by direct contact with lesions or indirectly from contaminated object such as hair or clothing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Parapoxvirus is made up of a dense DNA core surrounded by a less dense capsid and 2 narrow electron dense outer layers. After an incubation period of 3–7 days, parapoxvirus infections produce 1–3 painful lesions measuring 1-2 cm in diameter. During the next 6–8 weeks, the lesion passes through 6 clinical stages: maculopapular, target, acute weeping, nodular, papillomatous, and finally regressive stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Microscopically, in the maculopapular stage, there is vacuolization of cells in the upper third of the stratum malpighii leading to multilocular vesicles. Eosinophilic intranuclear or cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be seen. Vacuolated epidermal cells with inclusion bodies characterize the target stage. Ballooning degeneration also occurs in the target stage and affects keratinocytes rupture with a tendency to coalesce and produce reticulated vesicles. Additionally, in the epidermis, there is an elongation of the rete ridges. Many newly formed dilated capillaries and a mononuclear infiltrate are present in the dermis. This is followed by the acute weeping stage which is characterized by necrosis and a massive infiltrate of mononuclear cells throughout the dermis. Some biopsies of orf may have a marked reactive lymphoid infiltrate with CD30 positive T cells mimicking lymphoma. On progression to the nodular stage, a lichenoid reaction with a high percentage of histiocytes is seen in the skin. In the final papillomatous stage finger-like downward projections are displayed in the epidermis along with vasodilatation and chronic inflammation in the dermis. This results in resolution and regression of the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The natural history of the disease is complete resolution and no treatment is indicated. But antiseptic agents to prevent the superinfection and in some selected cases imiquimod can be applied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Although, immunity is short lived, reinfection frequently appears but no human-to-human transmission occurs.

HSP in the adult population is rare, and no case has been described of HSP in liver cirrhosis with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We present the case of a 58-year-old male with liver cirrhosis, who was subsequently diagnosed with SBP and later HSP. In this patient, the diagnosis of HSP was demonstrated clinically by his palpable purpura, diarrhea, hematuria, and abdominal pain and confirmed pathologically by his renal and skin biopsies demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis and IgA complexes. We believe that this is an example of altered IgA processing in cirrhosis leading to the development of IgA immune complexes and ultimately HSP. The patient additionally had SBP, which may have increased his risk for developing HSP given antigen processing by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues leading to immune complex deposition, which may not have been effectively cleared in the context of his liver disease. The patient unfortunately died of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which is unclear to be due to his underlying cirrhosis or a gastrointestinal manifestation of HSP itself.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel systemic vasculitis, predominantly affecting children, with ninety percent of cases occurring in the pediatric population. HSP is characterized by a tetrad of manifestations, specifically palpable purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal disease, with gastrointestinal and renal involvement more prevalent in older adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. The characteristic finding is leukocytoclastic vasculitis accompanied by IgA immune complexes within affected organs. Gastrointestinal symptoms of HSP can range from mild symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain to gastrointestinal hemorrhage, bowel ischemia, and bowel perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. About half of cases of HSP are preceded by an upper respiratory infection or other underlying infections. HSP in the adult population is rare, and no case has been described of HSP in liver cirrhosis with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We present the case of a 58-year-old male with liver cirrhosis and SBP, confounded by the diagnosis of HSP.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 58-year-old male with past medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, depression, HTN, chronic alcohol abuse, and BPH, presented to our hospital with worsening left-lower quadrant abdominal pain over three weeks and painless hematuria for five days. He had no known history of liver or kidney disease. Physical examination was significant for abdominal distension and left-lower quadrant abdominal tenderness. His initial labs demonstrated pancytopenia (white blood cell count 3.3, hemoglobin 7.7, hematocrit 23.4, and platelets 95), acute kidney injury (creatinine 1.6, unknown baseline), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 3.0), hyponatremia (sodium 129), and a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate 15.5), Table 1(a). Urine studies showed large amount of blood and RBCs with some hyaline casts and proteinuria, and urine electrolytes showed FeNa of 0.8%, Table 1(d). CT abdomen showed a nodular margin of the liver with mild intrahepatic biliary dilation, suggesting chronic liver disease, along with splenomegaly. US abdomen confirmed heterogeneous and nodular contour of liver with splenomegaly and moderate amount of ascites, likely sequelae of cirrhosis, with dopplers negative for thrombosis. The nodular liver on CT, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, splenomegaly, and moderate ascites all helped establish the new diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 (a) Initial labs. (b) Other labs. (c) Paracentesis. (d) Urine studies.</u>\n\n【7】Despite further labs to exclude viral, autoimmune, and other causes, Table 1(b), the etiology of his liver cirrhosis remained unclear, attributable to NASH versus alcohol given his history of uncontrolled diabetes and chronic etoh abuse, Table 1(b). Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, showing glucose 182, LDH 79, albumin 0.9, and protein 1.7 with 6400 RBCs and 1850 nucleated cells (51% granulocytes, 17% lymphocytes, and 32% tissue cells), Table 1(c). Cytopathological examination revealed no neoplastic cells, and bacterial culture was negative. The corrected neutrophil count of 917 and serum-ascites albumin gradient of 2.1 were consistent with SBP and portal hypertension, Table 1(c).\n\n【8】After diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B, MELD 6) and SBP, he was treated with IV ceftriaxone (2 g daily) and IV albumin (1.5 g/kg on first day and 1 g/kg on third day). He was placed on protonix given portal hypertension with unknown variceal status and was monitored for signs of hepatic encephalopathy, though he mentated well with no asterixis on exam. Repeat diagnostic paracentesis on day 3 demonstrated resolution of his SBP with 8150 RBCs and 305 nucleated cells (3% granulocytes, 51% lymphocytes, 45% tissue cells, and 1% eosinophils).\n\n【9】Despite the underlying diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and SBP, the basis of his renal dysfunction and hematuria continued to remain a mystery. Cystoscopy was negative for malignancy, and his urine sediment did not reveal any dysmorphic RBCs. Quantification of his proteinuria revealed a protein: creatinine ratio of 1.9. There was concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) given his low FeNa and bland urine sediment. He was given albumin with no improvement in his renal function in addition to treating underlying SBP, while additional treatments such as midodrine and octreotide were not pursued given his high MAPs. Work-up for other causes of his renal failure continued.\n\n【10】Four days after admission, he had diarrhea, and thirteen days later, he developed new purpuric macules and papules, approximately 0.3–1.5 cm in size, most prominent on his elbows but also on his abdomen, buttocks, back, and inguinal folds. Skin biopsy showed fibrin, neutrophils, and neutrophil fragments near vessels with mixed cellular infiltrate and extravasated erythrocytes, Figures 1(a) and 1(b). Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies showed deposition of IgA and C3 in vessel walls, supporting the diagnosis of HSP, Figures 1(c) and 1(d). Due to worsening renal function with creatinine rising to 4.9, renal biopsy was performed revealing mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, Figures 2(a) and 2(b), with crescents, Figures 2(c) and 2(d), and IgA, Figure 2(e), also consistent with HSP. He was given one dose of solumedrol 500 mg IV and started on prednisone 60 mg, which was tapered to 50 mg daily, with protonix to decrease GI bleeding risk. The purpuric lesions subsequently resolved with corticosteroid treatment.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Skin biopsy, right arm.

Due to concern for worsening renal failure, uremia, and oliguria, he underwent emergent hemodialysis. His course quickly deteriorated as he became acutely hypotensive, with a sudden hemoglobin drop to 4.8. After two units of transfusion to hemoglobin of 8.8, he coded one day later with profuse hematemesis after an episode of bright red blood per rectum and died.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】In this patient, the diagnosis of HSP was demonstrated clinically by his palpable purpura, diarrhea, hematuria, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis was confirmed pathologically by his renal and skin biopsies demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis and IgA complexes. While HSP is predominantly a pediatric disorder, its existence in adults is rare and its association with liver cirrhosis is even more scant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. There are only a few case reports describing the association between liver cirrhosis and HSP. For example, Aggarwal et al. reported one of the first cases of liver cirrhosis with acute renal failure and HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our case, however, is the first to show the significant extent of HSP in liver cirrhosis due to the combined renal and skin manifestations along with the additional complicating factor of SBP, which may have triggered his course of HSP.\n\n【16】Alcohol liver disease is characterized by IgA deposits in a continuous pattern along liver sinusoids, in addition to skin capillaries and mesangium of renal glomeruli. The liver contributes to the clearance of intravascular IgA, causing patients with chronic liver disease to show an increase in serum IgA concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Van de Wiel et al. studied the presence and concentration of circulating IgA-containing immune complexes in patients with alcoholic liver disease and patients with other nonalcoholic liver diseases with comparable serum IgA levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. He concluded that the presence of circulating IgA-containing immune complexes was directly related to the severity of liver damage and substantiated the pivotal role of the liver in clearing circulating IgA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The role of liver cirrhosis in the development of HSP is intriguing since this patient’s chronic liver disease may have precipitated the development of HSP with defective liver metabolism of IgA circulating immune complexes, leading to deposition in the skin and kidneys.\n\n【17】The diagnosis of SBP is particularly unique in this case and has not been previously reported in case reports of patients with combined HSP and liver cirrhosis. Observations in children with HSP have confirmed approximately 30–65% of IgA vasculitis cases occur after an upper respiratory tract infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Some propose that increased synthesis of IgA due to antigen processed by the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue leads to development of the disease by immune complex deposition between antigens and IgA in the skin, gut, and kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In this particular case, it could be hypothesized that SBP may have triggered antigen processing by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the gut and the subsequent development of IgA complexes, with impaired clearing due to the patient’s underlying liver cirrhosis, leading to the significant extent of his HSP.\n\n【18】This patient unfortunately had a rapid decline due to his hospital stay. The extent of his HSP with combined renal and skin manifestations has previously not been described in the literature in association with liver cirrhosis. While he received corticosteroid treatment, this does not prevent nephritis or alter the course of HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. His renal failure may have also been worsened by SBP and underlying cirrhosis, in addition to his IgA nephropathy. His ultimate hematemesis may have been due to variceal hemorrhage in the context of his liver cirrhosis, though gastrointestinal hemorrhage is known to be a rare manifestation of HSP.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【20】This is a unique case of significant HSP with both renal and skin manifestations along with SBP in a patient with underlying liver cirrhosis. While HSP is rare in adults, we believe that this is an example of altered IgA processing in cirrhosis leading to the development of IgA immune complexes and ultimately HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The patient additionally had SBP, which may have increased his risk for developing HSP given antigen processing by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues leading to immune complex deposition, which may not have been effectively cleared in the context of his liver disease.

The defect was filled with a pedicled buccal fat pad flap. The mesenchymal origin from the dental follicle of the fibromyxoma is the most plausible explanation. Radiological examination with MRI, CT, and conventional radiography contributes to the differential diagnosis from other benign tumors, such as the ameloblastoma. Its management is surgical and comprises enucleation and curettage or en bloc resection. Patients must be monitored for at least two years postoperatively in order to diagnose possible recurrence.

Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 46-year-old male was referred to the outpatient department of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic of the General Hospital “G. Papanikolaou” of Thessaloniki, with a swelling of the right maxilla. The swelling occurred 8 months prior to the consultation. Facial and mucosal numbness, pain, or tooth mobility was absent.\n\n【7】The medical anamnesis of the patient did not reveal anything in relation to the pathological condition. Radiological investigation by means of a panoramic radiograph was not helpful in diagnosing the lesion. Waters’ view revealed complete obstruction of the right maxillary sinus. A Computed Tomography (CT) imaging of the maxilla revealed a large radiolucent lesion extending from the area of the right canine to the area mesial to the first molar. Examination with Computed Tomography (CT) Scan showed expansion of the walls of the right maxillary sinus, obstruction with low density tissue of the whole cavity, and local erosion of the walls . The intravenous administration of contrast agent showed no enhancement of the lesion. Involvement of the floor of the left maxillary sinus, partial obstruction of the ethmoid sinus, and slight thickening of the mucosa of the left frontal sinus are indicative of a secondary sinusitis. The nasopharynx and lateral pharyngeal spaces were normal.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Axial Computed Tomography (CT) reveals expansion of the walls of the right maxillary sinus, obstruction with low density tissue of the whole cavity, and local erosion of the walls. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】The lesion was approached by means of a lateral rhinotomy incision, with enucleation and curettage of the tumor.\n\n【10】The lesion had a solid consistency and was totally resected .

Search terms included ≪fibromyxoma≫ and ≪myxoma≫. Exclusion criteria were not relevant papers, interviews, books’ and conferences’ abstracts, comments, replies to author and to editor, and unsupported opinion of an expert. 43 articles met our criteria. In order to record only reports of fibromyxoma and not myxoma, the articles were further sorted, in order to include those reports of fibromyxomas that were mentioned under the general term myxoma. Finally, 19 articles met all criteria and were chosen for further evaluation  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–26\\]</u>.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Reported cases of fibromyxoma of the maxilla.</u>\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Myxoma/fibromyxoma is a rare odontogenic neoplasm. Fibromyxoma is classified as a specific type of myxoma with a higher fibrous/myxoid tissue ratio than myxoma. There is a discrepancy regarding the reports of fibromyxoma, as many of them are classified under the general term “myxoma”, making the review of the literature difficult. According to Dutz and Stout, the term myxoma was first used by Virchow in 1863, but the term fibromyxoma was described by Marcove et al. in 1964 who reported extragnathic locations of fibromyxoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 28\\]</u>. We use the term myxoma/fibromyxoma as it is being used in many histopathological books in order to describe myxomas of the jaw bones. The review of the literature for previous reports of fibromyxoma was based on case reports that clearly report a “fibromyxoma”.\n\n【20】Myxomas/fibromyxomas are usually located intraorally most often in the posterior regions of the mandible, its angle and ramus and rarely extraorally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 29\\]</u>. The maxilla and anterior region of the mandible are rarely affected. The lesion can be diffused or well defined, uni- or multilocular. It is characterized by a mucous or gelatinous grayish-white tissue that replaces the spongy bone and displaces the cortical plates of the jaws 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Root displacement and resorption may be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It may refer to hard and also to soft tissues.\n\n【21】Previous theories stress that the lesion derives from the neural sheath or is the result of degeneration of fibromas, lipomas and so forth, due to the chronic irritation and the degenerative processes following tissue anoxemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Recent studies advocate that myxomas/fibromyxomas arise from the mesenchymatous tissue of the dental follicle, thus being described as odontogenic with fibroblasts playing the major role in cell dispersal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This explanation fails to describe soft tissue myxomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. They probably arise from supportive structures of the teeth like the gingiva and the periodontal ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Histopathological characteristics of the myxoma/fibromyxoma are the hypocellularity, the presence of stellate, spindle-shaped cells into a loose myxoid extracellular matrix with cells presenting with thin, long cytoplasmic prolongations that give to the tissue characteristics of immature mesenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. The fibromyxoid lesion may present loci of calcification or ossification and a higher amount of collagen fibres and vessels than a typical myxoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The presence of cells positive for actin fibres suggests that myofibroblasts may play a crucial role in cell proliferation in cooperation with the islands of odontogenic epithelium and mast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Myxomas are diagnosed with radiological, histological, and histochemical investigation. The radiological investigation reveals homogenous radiolucencies or sclerotic trabeculations with different appearances, like “honeycomb”, “soap bubble”, and “tennis racket” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. In our case, the lesion appeared as a large radiolucent area with no trabeculations.\n\n【24】Radiological examination plays a crucial role for the differential diagnosis of myxomas/fibromyxomas and also between benign myxomas and malignant neoplasms with myxomatous tissue. In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the lesion shows low-signal intensity in T1 and high-signal intensity in T2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In contrast, Kawai et al. advocate that the high-signal is shown in T1 and not in T2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. These discrepancies may be related to the ratio of fibrous/myxoid tissue, the viscosity, the concentration of proteins, the presence of haemorrhage and the hypocellularity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 31\\]</u>. Immunohistochemical examination uses antibodies against specific biological substances of neuronal, muscular, epithelial, and mesenchymal tissues. The evaluation of the presence of vimentin, an intermediate filament of the cytoskeleton characterises mesenchymal tissues, thus also myxomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Fibromyxomas also contain a high amount of hyaluronic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\n【25】During the process of differential diagnosis pathological conditions that should be included are ameloblastoma, central haemangioma, fibrous dysplasia, odontogenic cysts, aneurysmal cysts, central gigantocytic granuloma, metastatic neoplasms, well-differentiated liposarcoma, and other rare entities like desmoplastic fibroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 33\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The main pathological condition that may lead to difficulties in diagnosis is the ameloblastoma, especially when the bony septa are curviform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. An important characteristic for differential diagnosis is the fact that when a contrast agent (Gd-DTPA) is being administered, in case of the ameloblastoma the MRI shows strong enhancement of the solid portion of the tumor, in contrast to the myxoma that shows homogenous high signal intensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is also important to mention that root displacement and resorption is not unique in ameloblastoma.\n\n【27】The treatment of the fibromyxoma is surgical and involves enucleation and curettage. The avoidance of recurrence is strongly related to the complete resection of the lesion. The patient should be monitored for at least two years after the surgical intervention due to the higher rate of recurrence during this period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Myxomas/fibromyxomas show a recurrence rate between 25% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and 43% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This is strongly related to the nature of the lesion, presenting without a sheath, thus making the complete removal difficult. Other odontogenic tumors, like the keratocyst or the ameloblastoma show a higher recurrence rate of 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>–58,3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u> and 55%–90%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. The frequency of recurrence of a fibromyxoma of the jaws is higher than that of any other bone thus having a poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.\n\n【29】It is stressed that complete resection and peripheral osteotomy is the treatment of choice depending on the size and behaviour of the tumor and results in a lower rate of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7, 33, 37\\]</u>. Simon et al. suggest that radical resection with a margin of 1,5–2 cm of healthy bone is the treatment of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Small bony defects of the maxilla, under 5 cm, can be reconstructed by means of a pedicled buccal fat pad flap (BFP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. Greater bony defects require the positioning of an obturator prior to the reconstruction with a graft.\n\n【30】In conclusion, the maxilla is a rare location of a fibromyxoma. The radiological examination by means of CT and MRI plays an important role in the diagnosis of a fibromyxoma and in the differential diagnosis from other pathological entities such as the ameloblastoma. Its management is surgical and ranges from enucleation and curettage to complete resection and peripheral osteotomy according to its size. Patients must be monitored for at least two years postoperatively in order to diagnose possible recurrence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:16:15", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:18:10", "cost": 115.153}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:18:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:16:15"}

Case Report\n\n【6】A 65-year-old previously healthy male from Anuradhapura, north-central part of Sri Lanka, presented to the general medical ward following multiple wasp bites over the head and upper trunk. On admission, he had mild local pain at sting sites but was haemodynamically stable. He developed angioedema of the lips and tongue for which IM adrenaline was given at the emergency treatment unit. Later, he was transferred to the general medical ward for observation. About 8 hours following the bite, he developed severe pain on the left upper limb. On examination, the limb was cold to touch with feeble radial and brachial artery pulses, and finger saturation was not detectable on air. Immediately, vascular surgical opinion was sought, and an IV heparin infusion was started. His CT angiogram revealed long-segment brachial artery thrombosis from the midhumerus level on the left side . Thrombectomy was performed on the same day and fasciotomy the next day to salvage the limb .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT angiogram showing the left brachial artery occlusion (red arrow).</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Left arm following fasciotomy.</u>\n\n【9】Furthermore, he was investigated for a cause for this arterial thrombosis including complete blood count, liver and renal functions, fasting blood sugar, lipid profile, ECG, 2D echo, and clotting profile with thrombophilia screening, all of which yielded normal results.\n\n【10】With the temporal association of events in this previously healthy male in the absence of other risk factors for arterial thrombosis, it was concluded that the brachial artery thrombosis was due to wasp sting.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Wasp bites commonly cause simple allergic reactions, whereas systemic complications including anaphylaxis and arterial thrombosis are rare. Other systemic complications of wasp bite include myasthenia gravis, peripheral neuritis, Guillain–Barre syndrome, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenic purpura, and vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>. Wasp venom mainly contains three categories of compounds: (A) high-molecular-weight proteins including phospholipases, hyaluronidases, and antigen V, (B) low-molecular-weight peptides including mastoparans, wasp kinins, and chemotactic peptides, and (C) bioactive molecules including histamine, serotonin, catecholamines, acetylcholine, and tyramine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Large molecules often cause allergic reactions, while smaller compounds in larger quantities lead to systemic reactions. Vasoactive substances cause vascular spasm, vascular inflammation, and thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Exact pathophysiology of wasp venom-induced arterial thrombosis is yet to be described. It may be multifactorial. There had been several case reports where myocardial infarction was attributed to hypersensitivity, vasospasm, or vascular inflammation following wasp bite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4, 9, 10\\]</u>. Similarly, stroke either due to hypotension following anaphylaxis or direct vascular toxicity has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 11, 12\\]</u>. Leukotrienes and thromboxane in venom cause platelet aggregation and thrombosis, whereas phospholipases trigger an IgE-mediated reaction cascade leading to mast cell activation and synthesis of a number of inflammatory mediators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Direct toxic effect of wasp venom compounds and vascular inflammation may also play a role. Vasospasm and blood cell aggregation followed by thrombosis is another possible mechanism. Although adrenaline is a possible culprit for vasospasm, in the brachial artery which is a large artery, vasospasm is unlikely to be the cause for thrombosis. It is most likely that thrombosis was a result of combined effects of vascular inflammation and platelet aggregation due to wasp venom.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【16】Physicians encounter a large number of wasp bites in general medical wards. Although rare, vascular thrombosis is an important clinical outcome of wasp stings as the disability caused by such complications is severe and could have long-term effects on the quality of life of the patient. Prompt investigation and management should be implemented without a delay in such a clinical scenario.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:29", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:35", "cost": 6.055}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:28"}

On February 2, 2020, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that the public health emergency justified the development and emergency use of “in vitro diagnostics for the detection and/or diagnosis of the virus that causes COVID-19” by activating the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Unfortunately, effective mitigation efforts were thwarted early in the outbreak resulting in an expansion of the initial EUA on February 29, 2020, to improve accessibility to in vitro diagnostic testing. Expectantly, the development and deployment of SARS-CoV-2 testing including RT-PCR expanded rapidly in the weeks following the EUA expansion. These newly developed and approved SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests boast impressive positive and negative agreement rates nearing 100%. Despite the exceptionally high rates of agreement, caution is advised as the RT-PCR tests approved under the COVID-19 EUA are in vitro analyses developed with samples artificially doped with SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These tests therefore do not have clinically applicable sensitivity and specificity because they lack a “gold standard” for diagnosis. Here we present three challenging cases requiring cautious interpretation of the newest generation of RT-PCR molecular detection assays, highlighting the major challenges faced by providers treating patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In an unprecedented world of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a medley of non-FDA-approved tests has been thrust upon providers who are now challenged with their complex and potentially inconsistent interpretation. We aim to lay an intellectual framework for the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing via EUA FDA “authorized” studies and emphasize the limitations of rapid bedside interpretation. Paramount to this topic is the often misquoted “sensitivity and specificity” of the RT-PCR detection assays, a nonexistent test property for SARS-CoV-2 due to the lack of a gold standard for verification and validation. It is important for all providers to understand these constraints and the potentially misleading test results in the clinical context of their patients. This article brings forth the potential for misinformation and misinterpretation that could lead to undesired patient outcomes. We advocate a thorough assessment of a patient’s clinical picture without isolated interpretation of RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2. In an effort to guide clinicians through this unparalleled time, we present three case reports to support detailed and individualized interpretations of patient presentations in the context of both positive and negative RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2. We hope a deeper understanding of testing validation, and results will improve our medical communities’ ability to make a true diagnosis of clinically significant COVID-19 disease or lack thereof and open up future research of more validated tests.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case 1\n\n【5】The following case is of an elderly male who presented with metabolic encephalopathy and failure to thrive that was found to have persistently positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 over several weeks despite a lack of symptoms typically attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【6】A 90-year-old male with hypertension (HTN), well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), hyperlipidemia (HLD), coronary artery disease, mild Alzheimer’s dementia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 presented to the emergency department (ED) with generalized weakness and recurrent falls for the past few days. He was diagnosed with a possible urinary tract infection owing to an otherwise negative workup including a computed tomography (CT) head and chest radiograph (CXR). He did not initially undergo a NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission due to restrictions on testing at that time. He was discharged from the ED with oral antibiotics to his assisted living facility (ALF). Four days later, he returned to the ED with encephalopathy, progressive generalized weakness, and inadequate oral intake requiring admission to the inpatient medical ward. To note: the day after admission, the patient’s ALF reported an infection at their facility; however, our patient did not undergo a NP RT-PCR at that time as he had no indication for testing consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) testing algorithm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> (note: testing criteria have since been updated). Pertinent findings on presentation included a dry oropharynx, right lower lobe crackles, ecchymosis on lower extremities, and a significant encephalopathy. Initial workup revealed a serum creatinine of 2.46 (baseline 1.8), a procalcitonin of 0.16, and a normal CXR. He was diagnosed with failure to thrive, metabolic encephalopathy, and acute kidney injury (AKI) on CKD stage 3. He was initially treated with isotonic saline for volume repletion and general supportive care. On hospital day (HD) four, the patient’s metabolic encephalopathy persisted despite rehydration and resolution of his AKI warranting further investigation. Aside from a CRP of 57.4, his lab work, blood cultures, repeat procalcitonin (0.19), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, repeated CXR, and electroencephalogram (EEG) were unrevealing. Although the patient did not meet CDC testing criteria at that time, he underwent NP-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on HD nine. On HD 10, NP-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and the patient was placed on modified droplet precaution while exposed staff members were instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed given the concern for encephalopathy related to COVID-19. PCR on CSF was negative for SARS-CoV-2. His encephalopathy improved by HD 20 without additional therapies; unfortunately, his discharge was delayed secondary to persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests . On HD 30, CRP was retested and found to be improved at 8.4. He was discharged on HD 33 after two consecutive negative RT-PCR results. During his hospital course, he remained afebrile without pulmonary symptoms, imaging findings, supplemental oxygen requirements, or other signs of infection. All blood, urine, and LP cultures remained negative, and his metabolic encephalopathy was attributed to an atypical COVID-19 infection. Modified droplet precautions were removed once he had two consecutive negative NP RT-PCR tests, and he was discharged to his ALF without further follow-up or subsequent hospitalizations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and IgG index based on hospital day, Case 1.</u>\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Case 2\n\n【9】The following case is of a middle-aged female who was admitted for the treatment of a hepatohydrothorax with negative NP RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. She was readmitted hours after discharge for an empyema, with a repeat negative NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and subsequently developed COVID-19 pneumonia. After 12 days of hospitalization, the NP RT-PCR test detected SARS-CoV-2 concurrently with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (Ab) in her serum.\n\n【10】A fifty-three-year-old Caucasian female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), recurrent hepatohydrothorax, laparoscopic banding with takedown and sleeve gastrectomy, and anxiety and depressive disorder currently undergoing liver transplant evaluation initially presented to an outside hospital with a complaint of dyspnea. She was admitted with hypoxia and a large right pleural effusion. The patient developed hypotension of unknown etiology four days into admission and was transferred to the transplant intensive care unit (T-ICU) at our facility for further management. On presentation to our facility, she was afebrile with initial CXR demonstrating a moderate-large right pleural effusion with passive atelectasis in the right middle and upper lung zones and clear left lung fields. The patient had no known contact with persons with COVID-19 and had a negative NP RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test at the time of transfer. The patient received a pleural pigtail catheter to manage her recurrent right hepatohydrothorax with significant improvement in symptoms on subsequent imaging. She remained afebrile, normotensive, and improved to baseline; she was discharged home after 10 days of hospital care.\n\n【11】Within hours of returning home, the patient re-presented to the ED febrile, encephalopathic, tachycardic, and tachypneic with a maximum temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius. Pertinent data included a leukocytosis of 12.9, creatinine 1.5 (base 0.6), lactic acid 5.1 (from 2.5 the day prior), procalcitonin 0.34 (from 0.06 ten days prior), and a repeat NP RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 that was negative. She was admitted to the T-ICU and initiated on empiric piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and caspofungin for a suspected empyema. The patient initially responded; however, she began spiking fevers on HD eight. A CT chest 10 days after readmission was obtained and revealed a new, dense left-lower lobe consolidation with ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe and anterior left upper lobe with a resolution of her effusion. Despite empiric antimicrobial treatment, she became progressively hypoxic.\n\n【12】She underwent a repeat NP RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 along with serology for IgG Ab by ELISA and both resulted positively . At that time, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and placed on modified droplet precautions. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed thirteen days after readmission; the only positive finding was a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. A repeat CXR fifteen days after readmission revealed worsening bilateral interstitial and airspace opacities; she received lenzilumab for two consecutive treatments and two days later received convalescent plasma. Her COVID-19 pneumonia improved thereafter, and modified droplet precautions were removed once she had two consecutive negative NP RT-PCR tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. She was recommended to wait 21 days from symptom resolution and have two negative COVID tests 24 hours apart to be relisted for liver transplant . Interestingly, her pleural fluid culture from readmission and BAL cultures revealed no growth.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and IgG index based on hospital day, Case 2.</u>\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Case 3\n\n【15】The following case is of a middle-aged man recently recovered from severe COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and a positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【16】A sixty-one-year-old Caucasian male with HTN, HLD, DM2, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetic nephropathy presented to the ED with two days of progressively worsening cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. He had also been experiencing progressive weakness and diarrhea for the preceding 10 days. He had no known exposure to COVID-19. Upon initial exam, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with an oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) of 97% on room air. He was noted to have mild tachypnea and coarse crackles in the bilateral lung fields with the CXR revealing bilateral multifocal consolidations predominantly involving the mid- to lower lung zones. He rapidly deteriorated to a SaO<sub>2</sub> of 71% and was placed on a 100% nonrebreather. Within 12 hours of initial presentation, the patient required mechanical ventilation and was admitted to the intensive care unit. A NP RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 taken on admission returned positive prompting a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and he was placed on modified droplet precautions.\n\n【17】The patient was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Despite having a prolonged hospital course complicated by an Escherichia coli pneumonia superinfection, his respiratory status dramatically improved after 18 days of hospital care. CXR on HD 16 showed persistence of consolidations with minimal improvement. At the time of discharge, he did not require supplemental oxygen and was discharged home.\n\n【18】Six days after discharge, the patient re-presented to the ED with hypoxic respiratory failure, nausea, abdominal pain, and poor oral intake. Upon exam, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable yet tachypneic with a SaO<sub>2</sub> of 84% on room air. Again, he was noted to have coarse bilateral crackles and required 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain a normal SaO<sub>2</sub>. A CXR was significant for a marked bilateral interval increase in the interstitial and airspace opacities with near-complete consolidation at the lingula, when compared to his prior admission. The radiologist noted the findings were concerning for changes of recurrent COVID-related organizing pneumonia. Initial NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative upon readmission, but due to recent COVID-19 pneumonia, it was repeated the next day and found to be positive . At this time, he was placed on modified droplet precautions given the concern for recurrent COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and IgG index based on hospital day, Case 3.</u>\n\n【20】Laboratory data were significant for a decreased ferritin of 2010 mcg/L (prior admission peak of 4157 mcg/L), a decreased CRP of 31 mg/L (prior admission peak of 193.1 mg/L), and a decreased IL-6 of 7.2 pg/mL (decreased from 67.0 pg/mL). Serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG index was obtained and was 3.58. Despite a positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, the patient’s inflammatory markers had significantly decreased and alternate etiologies for the patient’s readmission were considered. Although the patient was compliant with scheduled hemodialysis, he underwent urgent hemodialysis with ultrafiltration of 4 L with significant clinical improvement. A transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated revealing an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40–45% compared to an LVEF of 53% just 45 days prior. At the time of discharge, the patient was breathing comfortably on room air without supplemental oxygen.\n\n【21】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【22】The rapid expansion of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in response to the EUA issued by the FDA was essential to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 . As of June 2020, over 130 FDA-authorized tests to identify current and past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 exist, including molecular (RT-PCR), serology (IgM/IgG), and antigen detection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Serologic testing authorized by the FDA during this unprecedented time is intended to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19; however, providers have been formally advised by the FDA of the limitations of current testing given the absence of a validated diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Weekly EUA testing approval for SARS-CoV-2. (b) Cumulative EUA-approved testing for SARS-CoV-2.</u>\n\n【24】No available tests for SARS-CoV-2 are “FDA-approved”; rather, tests are “FDA-authorized”. The process for FDA approval is lengthy, involving scientific review, regulatory review, assessment of effectiveness and safety, evaluation of performance, review of labeling, quality control mechanisms, and other requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>. As of March 14, 2020, the FDA has reported the “inappropriate promotion” of serologic tests by commercial laboratories including diagnostic application and poor performance during validation trials with the National Institute of Health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In addition to the limitations of testing validity, on March 13, 2020, the President issued a “Memorandum on Expanding State-Approved Diagnostic Tests” authorizing New York State along with any other state that requests the authority to do direct laboratory testing for COVID-19 without FDA validation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【25】To ensure accurate interpretation of a diagnostic test, a thorough knowledge of the methods of testing verification as well as comprehension of applications, limitations, and confounding factors that may influence results is required. Importantly, providers should familiarize themselves with the concept of agreement rates, not sensitivity and specificity. All current FDA-authorized RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 is reported in positive and negative agreement rates due to the absence of an accepted “gold standard”. Sensitivity and specificity are reserved for diagnostic tests with comparative testing to an established “gold standard” which is based on natural specimens. This does not exist for the diagnosis of COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9\\]</u>; under COVID-19 EUA, in vitro analyses are with contrived samples of artificially doped SARS-CoV-2 RNA. “Agreement rates” that approach 100% may be misleading to the public and providers alike, especially when reported out of context 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 10–12, 13\\]</u>. LabCorp has reported their COVID-19 RT-PCR test as having a positive percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 91.24%–100%) and a negative percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 92.87%–100%); Quest Diagnostics has reported a positive and negative percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 88.7–100%) along with a specificity of 100% (72/72, 95% CI: 95–100%), to name a few 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Deepening the above concerns surrounding the rapid development and deployment of testing under an EUA, providers are faced with additional uncertainties surrounding testing for SARS-CoV-2. The three cases above highlight some of these uncertainties and limitations in testing and are meant to encourage thorough interpretation of all clinical and objective data without using isolated results for diagnosis and decision-making.\n\n【27】False-positive RT-PCR results can lead to unnecessary testing or isolation, and individual and community panic. These results are due to replication-incompetent SARS-CoV-2 on PCR testing, as demonstrated in cases one and three by persistent positive results after clinical resolution of COVID-19-related disease. This replication can persist up to 12 weeks postinfection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Furthermore, the CDC updated their guidance on de-escalation of isolation precautions for patients with COVID-19 based on data showing the lack of replication-competent virus after 20 days of onset of disease. False positives suggesting true infection can also develop as a result of viral load kinetics, technical error, sample contamination, detection of an alternative microorganism, amplification errors, and separation techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In addition, FDA recommends 100 bases for nucleic acid-based molecular diagnostic testing; however, DNA probes used in RT-PCR kits for SARS-CoV-2 are 25 bases long, which leads to increased false-positive rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–19\\]</u>.\n\n【28】The second case acknowledges the existence of false-negative results. These are influenced by personnel-specific procedures including standard laboratory techniques, specimen collection including location and technique, and transport and handling. Increased false negatives are also related to the timing of testing and viral shedding, and variability between prime and probe target regions in the SARS genome in the setting of mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Solely relying on RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing for diagnosis in the above three cases could have led to increased invasive testing, increased care cost, misdiagnoses, delay in diagnosis, inappropriate or delayed quarantining, superspreading, and ultimately patient and societal harm.\n\n【30】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】The patient presented in Case 1 above highlights the existence of persistent asymptomatic shedding as well as having a low threshold for diagnosing atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, including encephalopathy and failure to thrive in the elderly. As a resident of an assisted living facility, a failure to initially identify his COVID-19 infection could have resulted in a significant spread to other community members and staff. We recommend maintaining a high index of suspicion for high-risk populations given the “superspreading” potential, and the need to test patients even if they lack the typical respiratory syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The patient presented in Case 2 above highlights the false reassurance providers may have when faced with a negative NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. The patient’s clinical syndrome was consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia despite initial negative testing; she was subsequently found to have a positive NP RT-PCR along with IgG antibodies simultaneously. According to the CDC, it can take 1–3 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after becoming infected but can vary by individual 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. This timeline would imply a false-negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR on admission. Due to the overconfidence in the sensitivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, the patient’s diagnosis and care was delayed and there was an increased risk of exposure to others. NP RT-PCR testing should not be considered in isolation but in the context of patient symptoms and laboratory and radiographic findings.\n\n【33】The patient presented in Case 3 above highlights the importance of expanding a differential diagnosis in the face of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Although recrudescence of COVID-19 is reported, alternate etiologies of the patient’s acute hypoxic respiratory failure were considered. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema secondary to acute systolic heart failure as a consequence of his prior COVID-19 infection was ultimately diagnosed. The positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at readmission was considered persistent shedding of replication-incompetent viral fragments rather than a primary recurrent pulmonary COVID-19 infectious etiology, or a false positive in clinical terms. Additionally, the CDC reports “no confirmed reports to date of a person being reinfected with COVID-19 within 3 months of initial infection” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【34】We strongly advise providers to cautiously interpret the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing in the clinical context of the patients they treat. As mentioned previously, providers should not equate the 100% positive and negative agreement rates to sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. Since tests were developed under an EUA, no official sensitivity or specificity data are available to date. The case examples above highlight common situations of false-positive and false-negative cases seen in clinical practice and remind providers not to rely solely on testing. The accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 infection should combine the clinical presentation and supporting findings along with an accurate interpretation of testing, taking into account the aforementioned details above.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:04:01", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:04:20", "cost": 19.64}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:04:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:04:01"}

Autoantibodies directed against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors cause a type of autoimmune encephalitis resulting in memory loss, confusion, and psychosis. A 28-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, seizure disorder, and stroke presented with a 2-day history of bizarre behavior, restlessness, insomnia, agitation, and hallucinations. He was initially managed for acute psychosis without any improvement. Further workup for organic causes revealed positive NMDAR antibodies in both the cerebrospinal fluid and serum, confirming a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. His condition later improved with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. This case signifies the importance of ruling out organic causes in patients with unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms. NMDA encephalitis is more common in young females with underlying malignancies, especially ovarian teratomas. This case is unique, given the extremely rare occurrence of NMDA encephalitis in male patients without any malignancies.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Autoimmune encephalitis is caused by autoantibodies against neuronal cell surface/synaptic proteins called N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. NMDARs play a significant role in maintaining synaptic plasticity and memory. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis has been associated with multiple infectious agents, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, herpes simplex virus, measles virus, mumps, and group-A hemolytic Streptococcus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Here, we describe the case of a young male with a known diagnosis of schizophrenia, presenting with confusion and hallucinations warranting psychiatric management and subsequently found to have anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 28-year-old male presented with a 2-day history of restlessness, bizarre behavior, confusion, and hallucinations. His past medical history was significant for schizophrenia, seizure disorder, and stroke with residual left-sided facial droop. There was no family history of psychiatric disorders. His family reported that he had no recent fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, runny nose, sore throat, cough, headaches, urinary symptoms, loss of appetite, or loss of weight. On physical examination, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was alert, oriented to person and place, but not to time. His fiancé reported that he had been pacing around his room, not sleeping, acting paranoid, and hearing voices. He was admitted to the psychiatry department for acute psychosis, where he was unsuccessfully managed with valproic acid, risperidone, and benztropine, with haloperidol and diphenhydramine as needed. A review of his chart revealed two past admissions for a similar presentation of acute psychosis, and he was discharged with outpatient psychiatry follow-up recommendation. The patient failed to follow-up as an outpatient, and no further workup was done at that time. His hospital course was complicated by worsening mental status, and he continued to be unresponsive to the abovementioned medications.\n\n【6】A thorough evaluation for organic causes was performed, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast, lumbar puncture (LP), and an autoimmune workup. The brain MRI with contrast showed multiple areas of bright signal intensity throughout the brain parenchyma, most notably in the medial temporal lobes and bilateral insular cortices, compatible with encephalitis . LP was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed white blood cell count, 8 mm<sup>3</sup>; neutrophils, 1 mm<sup>3</sup>; lymphocytes, 95%; protein, 35 mg/dl; and glucose, 56 mg/dl. CSF testing for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 DNA, varicella zoster PCR, VDRL, FTA ABS, enterovirus, and viral cultures were negative. A mild elevation of antinuclear antibody (1 : 40 titer) was noted. Blood and CSF were positive for oligoclonal bands.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Axial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) demonstrating bright signal intensity and gyriform swelling in the region of the uncus (a) and thalami and insular cortex (b).

The contrast study (d) does not show enhancement.</u>\n\n【8】Initially, the patient was started on empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for possible infectious causes of encephalitis. The diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis was confirmed when the CSF was found positive for NMDAR antibodies. Empiric antibiotics and acyclovir were discontinued, and the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 400 mg/kg/day for 5 days and methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 5 days.\n\n【9】The patient’s condition improved significantly.

Discussion\n\n【12】Although this patient presented with features typical of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, his history of schizophrenia, seizures, and acute psychotic episodes contributed to delayed diagnosis. The classic presentation of this syndrome involves the development of psychiatric symptoms, memory loss, sleep disturbances, and seizures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Malignancy is a known risk factor, and teratomas, germ cell tumors of the testes, and small cell lung cancer are specifically hypothesized to be associated with the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. The presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies is specific for diagnosis. Although it has been associated with pathogens including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, herpes simplex virus, measles virus, mumps, and group-A hemolytic Streptococcus, these were all negative in our patient. The improvement of symptoms in our patient after treatment with IVIG and methylprednisolone further strengthens the diagnosis. The pathophysiology behind psychiatric manifestations of this disease is anti-NMDAR antibody inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid at the presynaptic junction in the thalamus and frontal cortex. Subsequently, postsynaptic glutaminergic neurons are uninhibited, resulting in dysregulation of the dopaminergic pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Diagnosis of probable anti-NMDAR encephalitis requires the onset of at least four of the following symptoms within 3 months: abnormal behavior or cognitive dysfunction, speech dysfunction, movement disorder, dyskinesia, rigidity/abnormal posture, decreased level of consciousness, autonomic dysfunction, or central hypoventilation. Patients must also have either an abnormal electroencephalogram or CSF with pleocytosis or oligoclonal bands and reasonable exclusion of other disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】For a definitive diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, IgG anti-GluN1 antibodies (NMDA receptor antibodies) should be positive in the presence of one or more of the six major groups of symptoms, after exclusion of other disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient met the diagnostic criteria for definitive anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The treatment approach to anti-NMDAR encephalitis includes removal of the etiological agents such as a tumor or treatment of the underlying infectious source and immunotherapy. The immunotherapies commonly used are corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, and plasma exchange with plasmapheresis in severe cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In resistant cases, immunosuppression is induced using rituximab, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and methotrexate. Our patient responded well to immunotherapy with methylprednisolone and IVIG. Although symptoms are usually severe, studies suggest that patients are usually highly responsive to therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. As per a reported case series of 99 patients with all-cause encephalitis, 9.1% were found to have anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The mean age of these patients was 28 years, and 5 of 9 were females. Follow-up of these patients showed zero mortality and complete symptomatic recovery after treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment will reduce mortality and ensure complete recovery.\n\n【15】In conclusion, anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a very rare entity in male patients, especially in those without any underlying malignancies. However, physicians should consider this diagnosis as a differential in any young patient presenting with unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms. Younger patients who present with an initial episode of bizarre behavior should be assessed to rule out major organic causes, as delay in diagnosis leads to poor patient outcomes. Although literature suggests a predominance of anti-NMDAR encephalitis occurs in women with ovarian teratomas, this case demonstrates that the diagnosis should also be considered in men without any signs and symptoms of a neoplastic process, and a thorough workup for the infectious source should be conducted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:57:23", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:57:39", "cost": 16.816}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:57:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:57:22"}

Melioidosis is a bacterial infection caused by a Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei, prevalent in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Sri Lanka is situated in the endemic belt of melioidosis. Melioidosis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and results in high mortality rates in severe infection. Case Report. We report a 54-year-old previously healthy Sri Lankan farmer who presented with septicemia following a cut injury to the right leg while working in a paddy field. Initially, he had mild wound sepsis, and later, his condition deteriorated rapidly. The patient required organ support later for cardiovascular instability, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and coagulopathy. The patient’s blood culture was negative on the admission day, and the repeated blood culture taken at the ICU was contaminated with a commensal flora initially and later isolated Burkholderia pseudomallei. Although wound swab culture taken on the first day isolated an organism, it took six days to identify it as Burkholderia pseudomallei. The patient succumbed to severe melioidosis leading to a severe sepsis and multiorgan failure in spite of treatment with meropenem. Conclusion. This case report highlights the importance of considering melioidosis as a differential diagnosis when a patient comes with risk factors for melioidosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Melioidosis is an infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei which is a Gram-negative, oxidase-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming motile bacillus that is found in soil and water. Melioidosis is common in the tropical and subtropical zone between 30<sup>°</sup>N and 30<sup>°</sup>S 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Melioidosis is considered as endemic in Sri Lanka.\n\n【4】There are three modes of transmission of this agent. They are inhalation, ingestion, and direct inoculation. Person to person, sexual, perinatal, vertical, and nosocomial transmission have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Clinical presentation of melioidosis infection ranges from an asymptomatic state to rapidly severe sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It also has a chronic and relapsing course and can remain dormant for long periods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Polysaccharide capsule and lipopolysaccharide of the bacteria are resistant to compliment-mediated killing, which increases its virulence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Severe infection is common among people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, renal disease, liver disease, alcohol consumption, and thalassemia. Occupational exposure to surface water and mud in the form of agriculture, farming, fishing, gardening, land surveying, building construction, and manual labouring are risk factors for melioidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. A study conducted in Sri Lanka reported melioidosis in Sri Lanka has wide geographical distribution and it is common in rice-growing rural areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The incubation period of melioidosis varies, usually from 2 to 4 weeks, but can vary from 1 day to a few years. Clinical manifestations of melioidosis are not distinctive. Therefore, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation by isolation of Burkholderia pseudomallei from the clinical specimens. High degree of clinical suspicion is necessary to arrive at a diagnosis and commence treatment early because severe melioidosis is often lethal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【8】This case report highlights the importance of considering melioidosis in high-risk groups of Sri Lanka for early diagnosis and treatment to timely control the sepsis due to melioidosis.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【10】A previously healthy 54-year-old farmer from the Kurunagala district of Sri Lanka presented to our hospital with a history of fever with chills and rigors and a right leg wound following a cut injury and associated painful right leg swelling of 10 days duration. Twelve days back, he had sustained the cut injury from a cutting machine while he was walking in a paddy field. The wound was painful and had pus discharge. Along with fever, he had a painful inguinal lymph node on the right side. He had constitutional symptoms such as loss of appetite and malaise. Other systemic reviews were normal. He had consumed alcohol occasionally, and he was a nonsmoker.\n\n【11】Initially, he was treated by a general practitioner with oral antibiotics, and later, he was given in-ward treatment at a nearby local hospital for five days. At the local hospital, he was treated for febrile wound sepsis with intravenous cefotaxime 1 g 8 hourly and intravenous flucloxacillin 500 mg 6 hourly. Incision and drainage was performed for the wound at the local hospital. Despite the treatment, his symptoms worsened. Due to the lack of response, he got admitted to our hospital.\n\n【12】On the day of admission to our hospital, he was febrile. There was a superficial wound with pus on the anterior aspect of the right leg 5 cm proximal to the ankle joint which was associated with surrounding right-leg cellulitis. There was a tender right inguinal lymph node. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examination findings were normal.\n\n【13】His investigations showed raised white cell count (WBC) (14,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> 88% of neutrophils). The haemoglobin level was 12.4 g/dl, and platelet was 204,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Blood picture showed neutrophil leukocytosis with left shift and toxic changes in neutrophils suggestive of a bacterial infection. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was 173 mg/L. The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) was 18 mm/hour. His liver function and serum creatinine were within normal limits. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed a large right inguinal lymph node without formation of an abscess. Blood culture and urine culture taken on the admission day were negative. A wound swab culture taken on the admission day isolated an organism; however, it took six days to identify the organism as Burkholderia pseudomallei.\n\n【14】Initially, he was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g twice a day. The wound was cleaned and dressed with povidone iodine.\n\n【15】Five days after in-ward treatment in our hospital, his general condition deteriorated. He complained of worsening dry cough and shortness of breath. There was intermittent fever at 99°F, and he complained of reduced urine output. He became tachypnoeic (respiratory rate 25 breaths/minute), dyspnoeic, and tachycardic (pulse rate 144 beats/minute). The systolic blood pressure was 116/60 mmHg. He had bibasal fine and coarse crepitations more on the left side. His oxygen saturation dropped to 93% on room air. There were no audible cardiac murmurs. Abdominal and neurological examination findings were normal. His condition progressively deteriorated out of control. He was taken into an intensive care unit (ICU) on the same day for further management. At the ICU, his condition further deteriorated. He developed type 1 respiratory failure and vasodilatory shock. He was promptly intubated and ventilated and started on inotropes.\n\n【16】On the day of admission to the ICU, all the blood investigations, cultures, and imaging studies were repeated. He had rising WBC (23,000 cell/mm<sup>3)</sup> with neutrophil leukocytosis. Blood picture showed left shift and toxic changes in neutrophils without evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. There was a drastic drop in the platelets (112 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>). His CRP had risen to 420 mg/L, ESR was 20 mm/hour, and serum creatinine had increased to 356 micromoles/l with blood urea 81 mg/dl. He had oliguria. After admitting to the ICU, he was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Intravenous meropenem 1 g 12 hourly was started on day 1 of ICU suspecting possible melioidosis because of his exposure history with soil in the paddy field. A meropenem 1 g 12 hourly drug regime was given considering his acute kidney injury. He was also started on intravenous teicoplanin 400 mg daily to cover Gram-positive microbes and started intravenous metronidazole 500 mg three times a day to cover anaerobes and oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day to cover atypical organisms.\n\n【17】During the ICU stay, after commencing on broad-spectrum antibiotics, his CRP came down to 350 mg/L, but his WBC remained around 15,000–20,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. He had rising serum creatinine and blood urea and developed anuria. The serum lactate level increased up to 8 mmol/L. He had rising AST, ALT, and ALP levels. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and International Normalized Ratio (INR) levels increased rapidly. His acute kidney injury was complicated with hyperkalemia. Creatinine phosphokinase was 94 U/L. The summary of investigation findings on day 01 and during the ICU stay is illustrated in Table 1.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of investigation findings on day 01 and during ICU stay.</u>\n\n【19】Chest X-ray showed heterogenous opacifications at lung bases probably due to pulmonary oedema following acute kidney injury and due to associated melioidosis pneumonia . These X-rays features improved slightly while he was in the ICU. Transthoracic echo did not show vegetations. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed increased echogenicity of the kidney due to acute kidney injury.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest X-ray showing heterogenous bilateral, bibasal opacification mainly on the left side.</u>\n\n【21】Repeat blood culture, which was taken on day one of ICU stay, was initially contaminated with Gram-positive Staphylococcus coagulase negative organism which masked the Burkholderia pseudomallei. However, later, it isolated Burkholderia pseudomallei. On the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of ICU stay, the positive blood and wound swab culture reports for Burkholderia pseudomallei were available. Then, the diagnosis of melioidosis with evidence of severe sepsis and multiorgan failure was made. Its sensitivity pattern showed resistance to ceftazidime, tigecycline, colistin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, it was sensitive to meropenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Intravenous meropenem was continued since it is the drug of choice for severe melioidosis.\n\n【22】Furthermore, he developed fast atrial fibrillation. He had progressively worsening acute kidney injury, acute liver failure, and septic shock while in the ICU. He had bleeding from the endotracheal tube and developed melaena due to coagulopathy and low platelet. The patient was on ventilation and with a support of inotropes till the end. He was treated with amiodarone when he developed fast atrial fibrillation. He underwent daily hemodialysis for acute kidney injury but hardly had any improvement. Blood products were given when he developed bleeding to correct coagulopathy and low platelets. However, surprisingly, his right leg wound and cellulitis resolved gradually. Despite all these interventions, he continued to deteriorate. He went into refractory septic shock and multiorgan failure and died on the 7th day of ICU stay. The cause of death was severe melioidosis septicemia with multiorgan failure.\n\n【23】Before positive culture reports were available, we had a few differential diagnoses apart from melioidosis when he was admitted to the ICU. Leptospirosis was one of the differential diagnoses. It is a zoonotic infection in Sri Lanka caused by a spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. Usually, the organism is acquired by direct inoculation on to a past skin abrasion or mucosa from the wet muddy soil such as from the soil in a paddy field. This is characterized by febrile illness, which is complicated with low platelet count, acute kidney injury, pulmonary haemorrhages, and sometimes, acute liver failure. However, our patient’s leptospirosis IgM and IgG antibodies levels measured on the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of the illness were negative. We also thought of osteomyelitis of the right tibia with associated wound sepsis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, blood culture did not show MRSA and X-rays of the right tibia and fibula were normal. Since he had signs of lung infection, we investigated him for COVID-19, but the COVID-19 PCR test was negative. His dengue antibodies were negative. Dengue is an endemic mosquito-born viral disease in Sri Lanka. Venous duplex of the lower limb was performed to exclude deep vein thrombosis, and it only showed right leg subcutaneous oedema. HIV 1 and 2 antibodies were negative.\n\n【24】This case was an example for severe melioidosis sepsis which led to rapid progression leading to multiorgan failure and death.\n\n【25】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【26】Melioidosis is caused by Gram-negative saprophyte, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is a very virulent organism and shows antibiotic resistance. Melioidosis can affect any organ of the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Its presentation ranges from acute to chronic and local to systemic or subclinical infection. If present as septicemia, it can progress to multiorgan failure and death. The mortality rate is high, 90% without effective treatment and 50% even after antibiotic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The study conducted in Sri Lanka using 250 culture-positive melioidosis cases reported from 2006 to 2017 May has shown the mortality was 20.4% in the study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Severe infection is common in patients with diabetes, renal disease, liver disease, alcohol consumption, and thalassemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. People who have exposure to wet soils or water such as farmers, manual labourers, workers of building construction sites, and surveyors or who are involved in gardening and fishing are at a high risk of getting Burkholderia pseudomallei infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This patient, although he was immunocompetent, had occupational exposure. The patient was a previously healthy farmer and recently had a cut injury from a cutting machine while working in a paddy field. Direct inoculation of the organism on the wound via damaged skin from the wet soil and water in the paddy field might be the mode of transmission of the infection. High degree of suspicion of melioidosis is needed when the patient is from an endemic area with a potential exposure history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Melioidosis commonly affects the lungs followed by the skin and subcutaneous tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 11, 12\\]</u>. Skin and soft tissue infection due to melioidosis accounts for 13%–24% of clinical presentations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A study conducted in Sri Lanka has shown that lung infection due to melioidosis predominated followed by musculoskeletal infections, abdominal involvement, and skin and soft tissue involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Local infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue due to melioidosis can progress to bacteremia and severe septicemia as in this patient. Acute kidney injury is also one of the complications seen in severe melioidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Delay in considering melioidosis as a differential diagnosis and delay in initiating proper treatment for melioidosis can contribute to severe melioidosis.\n\n【29】Definitive diagnosis requires identification of Burkholderia pseudomallei in clinical specimens ideally by using Ashdown broth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. Bacterial culture has 100% specificity in diagnosing melioidosis; however, sensitivity has been estimated as low as 60% in one Bayesian model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The manual identification kits and automated microbial identification system generally do not recognize the organism as Burkholderia pseudomallei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore, it is essential to have high degree of suspicion of Burkholderia pseudomallei to look for Gram stain appearance, antibiotic susceptibility pattern, and colony morphology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is also difficult to isolate and identify Burkholderia pseudomallei from a nonsterile site due to scanty growth which is masked by the contamination with commensal flora. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Ashdown’s selective agar or an alternative selective agar is needed in addition to MacConkey and blood agar for primary isolation of Burkholderia pseudomallei from a nonsterile site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Serological investigations play a role when cultures are negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Burkholderia pseudomallei shows resistance to many antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. It is sensitive to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chlorampenicol, 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporin (ceftazidime), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ureidopenicillin, cefoperozone/sulbactam, azithromycin, and carbapenem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This patient’s isolate was resistant to ceftazidime but sensitive to meropenem and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\n\n【31】Current treatment guideline of melioidosis consists of two phases. They are two weeks of intensive therapy (which can be extended for 4 weeks if clinically required) with either intravenous ceftazidime or carbapenem followed by oral eradication therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 3–6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Rapid treatment of septicemia, eradication of the disease, and prevention of relapses are aims of this treatment regime 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Meropenem has some evidence in showing better outcome in severe melioidosis with septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Melioidosis causes significant mortality, morbidity, recurrences, and reinfection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore, early diagnosis and early initiation of correct antibiotic is necessary when managing a patient with melioidosis.\n\n【33】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【34】Melioidosis has a wide range of clinical presentations; therefore, it is necessary that clinicians have high degree of suspicion of melioidosis when a septic patient comes from a relevant geographical area with risk factors. It is important to have early suspicion and definitive diagnosis of melioidosis to start a correct treatment timely.

In Latin America, case series have been published, and it does not exceed 32 patients in 10 years, and in Colombia, there are case reports. We present a descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study in patients diagnosed with MCC in the Department of Pathology and Laboratories at the University Hospital Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá(FSFB) between January 2003 and December 2018. We present the demographic, clinical, and pathological variables of these patients, as well as a literature review.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy with unknown cellular origin, and current information reveals a trilinear differentiation; epithelial, neuroendocrine, and early B cell lymphocytic carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. 5-year survival for advanced-stage MCC has been reported between 0 and 18% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, the incidence of Merkel cell carcinoma is about 3 per 1000000 worldwide, and incidences appear to be increased either due to an aging population or improved detection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. MCC incidence varies by geographic regions, and it ranges from 0.13 per 100000 person-years in Europe to 1.6 per 100000 person-years. It accounts for <1% of cutaneous cancers in Europe based on a retrospective cohort study with 20 diagnosed MCC cases. In Colombia and Latin America, there are some reports published; one of the biggest reports is from Carneiro et al. with 32 cases presented in a period of 10 years in the Instituto Nacional de Cancer, on which they report late diagnosis that leads to high lethality by invasive disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Many reports of case series have identified the clinical features of MCC, and typically it present as a firm, painless red-violet nodule that is dome-shaped and has undergone rapid growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Nodules are common in areas exposed to sun, most frequently occur on head and neck, and less common on lower limbs, trunk, or other areas not exposed to sunlight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. History of extensive sun/ultraviolet (UV) exposure is recognized as a likely risk factor, and others include older age (most patients > 65 years old), Caucasian ethnicity, polyomavirus infection (reported 45%–100% of cases of MCC), and immunosuppressive states 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 7\\]</u>. Some authors have described that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) positive displayed very low mutation rates, but MCC polyomavirus negative exhibited a high mutation burden associated with a UV-induced DNA damage signature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. UV-induced damage is associated with the anatomic site of presentation and could differ by sex from the information of population surveillance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【5】For the definitive diagnosis, a biopsy is required; histology of MCC typically shows hyperchromatic nuclei and high mitotic activity on hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining. Histologic subtypes include intermediate type-most common, characterized by basophilic nuclei with high mitotic activity; trabecular type-rare usually only seen in mixed tumors; and small cell type-undifferentiated and may be identical to small-cell carcinomas of other sites, and less common morphological subtypes include glandular, squamous, and melanocytic carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. An immunohistochemistry study has to be performed with the appropriated immunopanel, and cytokeratin 20 (CK-20) was reported to be positive in 89%–100% of cases of MCC and considered testing for other neuroendocrine tumor markers to exclude other differential diagnoses including chromogranin A and synaptophysin.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【7】A retrospective review of all pathology samples with diagnosis of MCC and/or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma in the skin was conducted in the University Hospital Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá between January 2003 and December 2018. Approval from the Institutional Review Board was obtained before data collection. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record, and each case was compared to electronic pathology records to find pathological characteristics reported.\n\n【8】The medical information was reviewed and compared to the reported in the pathology database for each analyzed case, and then each pathology slide was reviewed and aditional clinically relevant information was included in a medical independent database designed for this investigation. Cases found in the database and identify as repeated were excluded.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【10】A total of 36 patients included in the review during the 10 years were analyzed in our pathology lab; there were 12 men (55.6%) and 16 women (44.4%), with a median age of 68 years (range 17–87 years). Clinicopathological characteristics of MCC are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1; the head and neck were the most common locations. 41% followed by the primary site were unknown and the last was skin without other specification (8.3%). Cytokeratin 7 was positive in 2 patients (5.6%), cytokeratin 20 was positive in 33 patients (91.1%), chromogranin A was positive in 25 patients (83.3%), and synaptophysin was positive in 24 patients (96.0%).\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Patient characteristics.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Tumor localization.</u>\n\n【13】We analyzed the localization by sex , and it showed that unknown primary site was 2 (12.5%) in female and 7 (35%) in male, skin without specification was 0 in women and 3 (15%) in men, head and neck localization was 6 (37.5%) in women and 9 (45%) in men; upper limb 4 (25%) in women and 0 in men, and lower limb in women was 4 (25%) and 1 (5%) in men. Figure 2 shows the distribution of localization by sex. We match the CK-20 results with neuroendocrine markers; CK-20 was positive in 30 of the neuroendocrine markers (93.8%), and 2 CK-20 positive were negative for neuroendocrine markers. 2 samples negative for CK-20 were positive for neuroendocrine markers and one sample did not have CK-20 result.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Population.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 3 Localization by sex.</u>\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Distribution by sex.</u>\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare skin tumor and its diagnosis is difficult. The diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma is confirmed with immunohistochemical stains for distinction from other small-cell malignancies, as small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or lymphoma.

This series of cases shows the experience of Merkel diagnosis in 16 years in a reference center of pathology.\n\n【19】This review shows the clinical presentation and the confirmatory immunohistochemical stains  to differentiate from other neuroendocrine tumors. From this analysis, the head and neck were the most common localization, followed by primary site unknown, and this review similar to others reports of Hitchcock et al. who reported primary site lesion as head and neck 48.9%, upper extremities 15.6%, and lower extremities 30.2%, but without report of the unknown primary site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.

Acupuncture is a form of complementary medicine and has gained popularity worldwide in the last few decades. It is mainly used for the treatment of chronic pain. Acupuncture is usually considered a safe procedure but has been reported to cause serious complications including death. It has been associated with transmission of many viruses and bacteria. Two cases of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus have been reported recently following acupuncture therapy.

This case should raise awareness of such condition and hazards of presumably benign procedures such as acupuncture.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Acupuncture in Latin words means “acus” (needle) and “puncture” (penetration). Acupuncture is one of the oldest medical procedures in the world and originated in China about 2,000 years ago. In United States it appeared in the early 18th century but gained popularity after 1971 when New York Times journalist, James Reston, reported his experience with acupuncture. He was visiting China for President Nixon’s visit. He had an emergency appendectomy in China and was given acupuncture for postoperative analgesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Acupuncture is mainly used for the treatment of chronic pain such as back pain, neck pain, and joint pain and for conditions like fatigue, insomnia, and depression. However, acupuncture, presumably a benign procedure, is related to the transmission of infectious agents and can cause devastating complications. We are reporting a first case of community acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acute osteomyelitis with intraspinal and multiple paraspinal abscesses related to acupuncture.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 57-year-old Korean female presented with complaints of two-day history of nausea, vomiting, and generalized weakness along with subjective fever and night sweats. The patient also complained of intermittent chronic back pain for years that worsened over last week and made her go to have acupuncture therapy for the first time two days priorly for her chronic back pain but unfortunately pain got worse. Her physical examination revealed tenderness in the lumbosacral region without any redness or erythema. Laboratory tests showed normal white count with bands of 34% (normal range: 0–5%). Chest X-ray showed patchy opacities in the bilateral lower lung fields. Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【6】The next day after admission the patient developed urinary retention. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar spine was done to rule out disc herniation, which instead showed enlargement of the right psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles with induration of paraspinal soft tissue. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine showed fluid in the soft tissues posteriorly, which was reported as nonspecific but could be related to acupuncture.\n\n【7】Blood cultures came back positive for MRSA and only Vancomycin was continued. The patient developed multiple 2 mm new skin pustules over her legs and cultures from the skin lesions were also positive for MRSA. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram failed to show any vegetation. A chest CT and abdominal MRI were done to discover the occult source of infection. The chest CT showed multiple necrotizing nodules suggestive of septic emboli. The abdomen MRI showed fluid collection posterolateral to the right psoas muscle, which was likely due to abscess formation. Multiple new small microabscesses in the paraspinal muscles and early osteomyelitis of the L2 vertebral body were also reported . A new small (0.6 × 0.5 cm) intraspinal fluid collection was also seen at the L2 vertebral body. CT-guided aspiration of the right paraspinal abscess was done and cultures were sent, which came back positive for MRSA as well. The patient was continued on Vancomycin.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 MRI lumbar spine. (a) MRI of the lumbar spine with contrast showing L2 vertebral osteomyelitis. (b) MRI of the lumbar spine showing paraspinal abscess. (c) Follow-up MRI of the lumbar spine showing resolution of the osteomyelitis and the paraspinal abscesses.</u>\n\n【9】MRI and CT of the lumbar spine after four weeks of antibiotic therapy again demonstrated osteomyelitis of the L2 vertebra. The paraspinal fluid collections demonstrated interval decrease in size and resolution of the intraspinal fluid collection. The patient reported improvement of back pain and was discharged on a 12-week course of intravenous Vancomycin. An MRI of the lumbar spine  eight weeks following antibiotic therapy showed significant improvement of osteomyelitis and almost complete resolution of abscesses. The delayed CT scan showed complete resolution of abscesses. During a follow-up visit the patient stated that her back pain had resolved.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Acupuncture is gaining popularity as a common therapeutic procedure for chronic pain control in the United States. However, due to failure to follow infection control guidelines for acupuncture therapy (Australian Acupuncture Association Limited, 1997) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, there has been transmission of various infectious agents . A review of the literature revealed that infectious agents such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus in 1988 and 1993 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>, Human Immunodeficiency Virus in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, Mycobacteria in 2001 and 2002 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>, Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in 1997, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>, and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 2008 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u> were reported to have been transmitted by acupuncture. Now in 2015 we are reporting a first case of acupuncture associated MRSA acute vertebral osteomyelitis with intraspinal and multiple paraspinal abscesses.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Infectious complications related to acupuncture (MSSA and MRSA).</u>\n\n【13】Along with infectious complications, acupuncture is also known to be associated with mechanical organ injuries. Three deaths have been reported in which acupuncture was claimed as the cause, with one patient who died from endocarditis, another from bilateral pneumothorax, and a third due to severe asthma during acupuncture therapy. The adverse effects of acupuncture can be prevented with sound anatomical and medical knowledge, proper hygiene practices, and adequate acupuncture education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Vertebral osteomyelitis is classified as being acute, subacute, or chronic. Acute osteomyelitis develops in a few days or weeks while subacute or chronic occurs over weeks to months before treatment is initiated. Vertebral osteomyelitis occurs via hematogenous, direct inoculation, or contagious transmission. The lumbar spine is most commonly involved (58%), followed by the thoracic spine (30%) and the cervical spine (11%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Patients with vertebral osteomyelitis usually present with back pain and fever and may have some form of neurologic deficit. MRI has a high sensitivity (96%) and specificity (92%) for diagnosing vertebral osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However, response to treatment is determined by clinical assessment and inflammatory markers since radiologic improvement by MRI is delayed and always follows clinical improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Follow-up MRI is only indicated when there are no signs of clinical improvement after four weeks of therapy or an abscess is suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【16】A high index of clinical suspicion is required for vertebral osteomyelitis since the presentation can be very vague. Early imaging studies and empiric antibiotic therapy covering MRSA should be initiated to prevent serious complications, since Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism causing vertebral osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Treatment duration for osteomyelitis is generally recommended for six weeks but a longer course should be considered in complicated infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. In the present case, the patient received parenteral Vancomycin for three months and CT-guided aspiration of paraspinal abscess which resulted in a favorable outcome.\n\n【17】In the present case, back pain worsened over weeks which is the natural course of mechanical low back pain but having acute worsening after acupuncture directly suggests that bacterial inoculation at the time of procedure which was further complicated by bacteremia although there was no local skin abscess at the site of acupuncture temporal correlation is evident. The patient had been in the United States for years and this was her first hospitalization and she did not have any other medical problem suggesting that she could be carrier for MRSA so it was assumed that this infection was acquired from acupuncture as reported from previous literature.\n\n【18】To best of our knowledge, only two cases of MRSA associated with acupuncture have been reported in the literature to date. Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported acupuncture associated MRSA necrotizing aortitis in April 2008 and Woo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported MRSA causing septic arthritis following acupuncture in August 2008. We are reporting a third case of MRSA associated with acupuncture. However, this is the first case of MRSA associated vertebral osteomyelitis with spinal and paraspinal abscesses.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】Vertebral osteomyelitis and/or abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis in a patient presenting with worsening back pain following acupuncture therapy. Diagnoses of vertebral osteomyelitis can easily be missed or delayed due to its vague presentation. Careful history taking and early initiation of therapy is of paramount importance for a favorable outcome. Acupuncturists should possess sound anatomical and medical knowledge and adhere to proper hygiene standards and techniques with consistent review of the infection control guidelines pertaining to acupuncture to prevent the devastating complications and significant financial expenditure due to prolonged hospitalization.

Here, we report a 40-year-old female who presented with muscle weakness, musculoskeletal pain, and proteinuria, which was eventually diagnosed as myopathic amyloidosis based on muscle biopsy results. A multidisciplinary approach appears to be the cornerstone of the diagnostic work up for recognizing the unusual amyloid myopathy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In primary systemic amyloidosis, insoluble immunoglobulin light chains clump together to create amyloid fibrils. In about 90% of patients, a monoclonal protein is traceable in the urine or serum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common kind of acquired amyloidosis is immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The condition is caused following a misfolded monoclonal light chain generated by a plasma cell or B-cell clone, which has a proclivity for aggregation and tissue deposition, resulting in organ failure. Although it is primarily a systemic illness with the potential for widespread organ harm, localized deposits have been documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Muscle involvement has been rarely reported in AL amyloidosis, and amyloid myopathy is frequently misdiagnosed and delayed. Amyloid myopathy is a symptom that can occur before the diagnosis of systemic AL amyloidosis. Herein, we describe a case of a 40-year-old female who presented with proteinuria, muscle weakness, and musculoskeletal pain, which was eventually diagnosed as myopathic amyloidosis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Current Presentation\n\n【6】Our patient is a 40-year-old woman hospitalized with progressively worsening muscular weakness as her chief complaint since three months prior to hospitalization. The patient also complained of difficulties rising from a seated posture and proximal muscle pain. Shortly after that, she developed skin stiffness, tightness of the palms and soles, muscular stiffness, and pain in the left knee. In addition to worsening her existing symptoms, she presented with widespread body pain, wrist and ankle arthralgia, morning stiffness, tingling, and sole paresthesia around one month ago. Moreover, she reported discomfort in the temporomandibular joint and difficulties opening her mouth because of TMJ pain. She also complained of weight loss, night sweats, and dysphagia beginning two weeks before her admission, and these symptoms progressed in parallel with her other symptoms.\n\n【7】##### 2.2. Past Medical History\n\n【8】Her problem started about three years ago when she was found to have mild hematuria and proteinuria on routine examinations. At that time, proteinuria was mild, and the initial laboratory tests such as fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, hepatitis B and C serology, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), C3, C4, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were all unremarkable. However, due to an increase in proteinuria and a kidney biopsy demonstrating focal mild mesangial proliferation but negative immunofluorescent results, prednisolone and cyclosporine were administered. The patient was then closely followed by a nephrologist. During that time (around one and a half year before current hospitalization), serum protein electrophoresis was requested which demonstrated albumin: 68.4% (normal: 55.8–66.1%), alpha one: 4.6 (normal: 2.9–4.9), alpha 2: 9.6 (normal: 7.1–11.8), beta 1: 4.8 (normal: 4.7–7.2), beta 2: 4.1 (normal: 3.2–6.5), gamma: 8.5 (normal: 11.1–18.8), total protein: 6.9 g/dl, and A/G ratio: 2.16. Urine electrophoresis demonstrated normal range of protein factors. Since regular urine protein measurements had a downward trend, cyclosporine was discontinued, and prednisolone dosage was slowly tapered to 5 mg daily. Other medical history included peptic ulcer disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hypothyroidism, controlled with levothyroxine and proton-pump inhibitors.\n\n【9】##### 2.3. Physical Examination\n\n【10】Physical examination showed normal vital signs. Macroglossia and lateral tongue scalloping were noted while the patient was unable to protrude her tongue . The findings of extremity examination consisted of fascia hardening of soles and palms, sclerodactyly , arthritis of both wrists and right ankle, lower extremity pitting edema, and muscle stiffness which was particularly evident in biceps and triceps. Furthermore, flexion contracture of knees , elbows, shoulders, and hip was found. Even though the muscle power was 5/5 in all extremities, the squatting test was impaired. There were no signs of neuropathy in physical examination.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Macroglossia and lateral scalloping of the tongue, (b) flexion contracture of the knee joint, and (c) skin stiffness of palms and sclerodactyly.</u>\n\n【12】##### 2.4. Investigations\n\n【13】Given that the patient had proteinuria, a nephrologist requested laboratory tests, including fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, hepatitis B and C serology, ANA, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, anti-GBM, and ANCA, which were all normal. All kidney function tests were unremarkable; however, previous kidney biopsy showed focal mild mesangial proliferation. In addition, the immunofluorescent study of kidney tissue was negative for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, C1q, fibrinogen, kappa, and lambda. Due to the recent addition of proximal muscle weakness, skin thickening, and arthralgia to the preexisting proteinuria, she was hospitalized, and additional laboratory tests regarding the diagnosis of myositis due to connective tissue diseases were requested, with all serological results being negative. Myopathy immunologic panel testing, scleroderma-related antibodies, and thyroid function test also demonstrated normal results. Furthermore, muscle enzyme results, including lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, and aldolase, were unremarkable. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocity (EMG-NCV) study suggested a mild myopathic process. For bilateral thigh and arms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed widespread perimuscular fluid and edema with concomitant subcutaneous fluid around muscles, as well as grade 1-2 fatty changes in all pelvis and leg and arm muscles along with mild to moderate intramuscular edema . Another finding of upper extremity MRI was bilaterally diffuse subcutaneous fat thickening . There was no evidence of bone lesions.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a and b): MRI of both legs; T1W (a) and fluid sensitive fat sat (b) sequences; perimuscular and fascial edema (curved arrow) and intra muscular edema (arrow) within gastrocnemius muscles; (c and d): MRI of both thighs T1W (c) and fluid sensitive fat sat (d) sequences; perimuscular and fascial edema (arrow) more in anterior compartment.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 MRI of right arm T1W (a) and fat sat (b) and (c)-(d) MRI of left shoulder T1W (c) and fat sat (d) sequences. Note to the diffuse perimuscular and fascial edema more along the latissimus dorsi and rotator cuff muscles .</u>\n\n【16】Given the concurrent occurrence of macroglossia and proteinuria, amyloidosis was not an unlikely diagnosis at the time. However, the likelihood of amyloidosis caused by an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia increased when the patient’s laboratory results revealed high calcium levels, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and anemia. Serum electrophoresis measurements were alpha 1: 7.4%, alpha 2: 14.9%, beta 1: 5.4%, beta 2: 4.7%, and gamma: 7.9%; however, in serum immune typing electrophoresis, despite markedly decreased free kappa to free lambda ratio, no obvious monoclonal band was detected. The urine electrophoresis pattern was in agreement with a mixed tubular and nonselective glomerular proteinuria. Moreover, urine immune fixation electrophoresis showed two precipitant lines with lambda and kappa. In revaluation of previous kidney core needle biopsy slides, no amyloid deposit on light microscopy was identified. Kidney biopsy revealed no evidence of amyloid deposit within the glomeruli and in the wall of tubules and blood vessels based on H&E staining. Abdominal wall fat biopsy showed no significant pathologic changes, and Congo red staining was negative for amyloid deposition.\n\n【17】In order to establish the diagnosis of plasma cell dyscrasia, a bone marrow sample and histologic examination demonstrated the replacement of marrow spaces by sheets of plasmacytoid cells. The majority of cells were positive for CD138 with lambda light chain restriction . Biopsies were taken from the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle and its fascia to back up the diagnosis. The histologic exam revealed skeletal muscle fibers with variation in size and degenerative/regenerative changes. Vascular structures showed thickening of the wall with deposition of hyalinized eosinophilic material. Also, endomysial and perimysial connective tissue was expanded with foci of deposition of the same material, which was confirmed to be amyloid by Congo red staining . The findings were consistent with amyloid myopathy. As a result, the diagnosis of amyloidosis due to underlying plasma cell dyscrasia with lambda light chain restriction was made. Given the probable involvement of several organs by amyloidosis, we performed further investigations. Except for a grade 1 diastolic dysfunction, cardiac transthoracic echocardiography was normal. Gastroesophageal endoscopy showed esophagitis and gastric ulcer, which were benign according to tissue diagnosis. The CT scans of the abdomen, pelvis, chest, and liver function tests were likewise normal. Neck, arm, and thigh MRI evaluations were similar to previous report and demonstrated widespread perimuscular fluid and edema with concomitant subcutaneous fluid around muscles, as well as grade 1-2 fatty changes of muscles and mild to moderate intramuscular edema.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Bone marrow shows sheets of plasmacytoid cells.

Treatment and Follow-Up\n\n【21】The patient was referred to the hematology clinic, where chemotherapy regimen consisting of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone was commenced. She also received an autologous bone marrow transplant one year after her diagnosis. Since receiving the transplant around eight months ago, the patient’s muscle pain and proteinuria have considerably improved but has remaining difficulties in rising from a seated position and mouth opening.\n\n【22】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【23】Lubarsch reported muscle involvement in amyloid in a patient in 1929, and the patient had both interstitial and vascular deposits in the heart and skeletal muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Despite this, even in individuals with a known dysproteinemia, amyloidosis remains an uncommon cause of myopathy. In a recent study of 3434 AL amyloidosis patients, 1.5% showed a positive amyloid deposition in muscle biopsy, in which 11 (22%) had amyloid muscle involvement. Myalgia, muscle weakness, macroglossia, jaw claudication, dysphagia, skeletal pseudohypertrophy, and hoarseness are common symptoms in individuals with amyloid myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Our patient had a gradual lower-limb muscular weakness, as well as jaw claudication. Our report was similar to a report by Accardi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> which reported progressive lower-limb muscle weakness with discomfort and stiffness in the hips and shoulders, as well as jaw claudication, without any biochemical markers of muscle involvement. In their report, based on amyloid deposits in the salivary gland, the final diagnosis was considered as systemic AL amyloidosis along with myopathic involvement. However, because no other symptoms or indicators of systemic AL amyloidosis involvement, such as cardiac failure or renal proteinuria, were evident, the myopathy remained the lone clinical presentation of the disease. This was also supported in a study by Liewluck and Milone among AL amyloidosis muscle involvement patients, with 70% presenting with only myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Among specific clinical aspects, including less frequent CPK elevation and earlier age at onset, AL-systemic amyloidosis-associated myopathy diverges from pure isolated amyloid myopathy induced by other amyloidogenic protein subtypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Isolated amyloid myopathy is most commonly caused by anoctaminopathy-5 and can be observed in 27% of cases of amyloid myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Detection of systemic involvement in amyloid myopathy may be facilitated with laboratory, clinical, and pathological features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In isolated amyloid myopathy, patients are younger and have higher CK, as expected since the main causes are genetic such as dysferlinopathy and anoctaminopathy. However, in AL-systemic amyloidosis, patients are older with normal or slightly increased CK (<2.5 × upper limit). Our patient demonstrated weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, arthropathy, jaw claudication, kidney involvement, macroglossia, and muscle involvement with normal CK levels, which based on the multisystemic involvement, suggests primary AL-systemic amyloidosis.\n\n【24】The duration between the beginning of the first muscular sign and the diagnosis of amyloidosis in this patient was three months. The median period from the initial illness signs to diagnosis was 23 months in a study among AL amyloidosis patients with positive muscle biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Dissimilar to other amyloid proteins, amyloid deposition in cases of AL amyloidosis can affect various organs, and distinct criteria for evaluation of organ involvement have been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. When amyloid accumulation and the consequent organ damage occur primarily in a less frequent place, including the striated muscle, the diagnostic pitfall may be especially relevant. However, diagnosis delay in amyloidosis is common, as evidenced by a recent patient experience study that found that 37.1% of patients acquired the proper diagnostic formulation during their one year follow-up from their onset of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The preliminary muscle biopsy failed in detecting amyloid accumulation in 19 of the 79 individuals studied by Chapin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This was owing to a variety of factors, including a “random” biopsy not involving that specific muscle area or the lack of Congo staining 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Muchtar et al. observed that a diverse muscle disorder was identified in roughly 40% of the cases prior to the histological review 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, which is consistent with this observation. The hazard of disease exacerbation increases through delay in diagnosis, especially with cardiac involvement, which regulates the prognosis and stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14–16\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Based on previous reports, three basic clinical presenting types of amyloid myopathy have been documented in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 12, 17\\]</u>. The first group has skeletal pseudohypertrophy with palpable nodules in muscles and an abnormal “wood-like” consistency, which is typically linked with macroglossia. Patients in the second category have muscle weakness, especially proximal, possibly accompanied by atrophy but no other symptoms of amyloid tissue accumulation. Since the diagnosis is challenging and should consider all probable differential diagnoses of myopathy, the “atrophic type” poses a clinical problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. A mixed clinical phenotype is the third group.\n\n【27】Claudication was observed in our study and also four of 12 patients in a report by Gertz and Kyle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> and has previously been linked to amyloid myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. It is caused by amyloid accumulation in the bloodstream, which leads to ischemia and occlusion of tiny blood arteries. In the past, many individuals were misdiagnosed as having giant cell arteritis and treated with heavy doses of corticosteroids.\n\n【28】Muscle fiber damage is a poorly understood pathophysiological process. Fibril deposition is routinely detected on perimysial and endomysial arteries in muscle amyloidosis, as in our instance, suggesting prolonged ischemia resulting from endothelial injury as a plausible cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Denervation atrophy and also necrotic fibers with regeneration signals are less commonly documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 12\\]</u>. Delaporte et al. found a rise in the synthesis of protein and also cell fusion of human myoblasts in culture following exposure to pure kappa chain serum from a case of muscular pseudohypertrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The large interpatient diversity in protein structure and tissue tropism, previously discovered in amyloid proteins produced from similar variable light chain gene, is among the noteworthy features of AL amyloidosis. The specificity along with the kind of organ damage can be dramatically influenced by a small alteration in the amino acid sequence acquired during hypersomatic mutation of immunoglobulin genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【29】#### 4\\.

Introduction\n\n【3】Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) was primarily described in Japan and is usually characterized by transient left ventricular apical ballooning. TCM is named after the original Japanese octopus trap and shows a left ventricular dysfunction most commonly with preserved basal function and moderate-to-severe dysfunction in the midventricle or apical regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. In a minority of patients a different pattern with preserved apical contractile function and impaired basolateral contractility was observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 5\\]</u>. TCM predominantly affects women and is frequently triggered by preceding emotional or physical stress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. The pathogenesis of the TCM is still unknown. Catecholamine-mediated cardiotoxicity provoked by emotional or physical stress has been proposed as an explanation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Due to the clinical symptoms which include chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, and elevated myocardial markers, this syndrome may be misdiagnosed as an acute coronary syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 8\\]</u>.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is frequently associated with emotional stress, but to date no cases of STEMI triggering TCM have been reported. We describe a case of a female patient with ST-elevation myocardial infarction complicated by TCM.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 82-year old female patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia and osteoporosis was admitted to the emergency department of a community hospital with chest pain. On admission she did not report about an obvious emotional stress situation. She was under chronic therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/od), simvastatin (20 mg/od) and esomeprazole (20 mg/od). Initially she had a pulse rate of 68 beats/min and a blood pressure of 116/81 mmHg. Her physical examination was normal. The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and ST-elevations in the leads II, aVF, and V2–V6 . ST-elevation myocardial infarction was diagnosed, and the patient received acetylsalicylic acid (500 mg i.v), clopidogrel (600 mg p.o.), and unfractionated heparin (5000 IE i.v.) and was immediately transferred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (primary PCI) to our catheter laboratory. Time from symptom onset to primary PCI was 8 hours. The immediately performed coronary angiography revealed coronary three-vessel disease with a 50% stenosis in the LAD, a 50% stenosis in the right coronary artery, and a subtotal occlusion (99%) of the circumflex coronary artery . The left anterior descending coronary artery was not a large wrap-around vessel and did not supply the midinferior segment. We performed a primary PCI with bare metal stenting of the circumflex coronary artery (Coroflex Blue 2,5/8 mm). Angiogram showed a left ventricular dysfunction with preserved basal function and moderate-to-severe dysfunction in the midventricle and apical regions . Laboratory testing revealed elevated levels of Troponin T (0.56 ng/mL, (UNL: < 0.03 ng/mL)) and creatinine kinase (214 U/L, (UNL: < 145 U/L)). Catecholamine plasma levels were not measured. During the hospital stay the patient received fondaparinux (2,5 mg/od), beta blockers (metoprolol 47,5 mg/td), ACE inhibitors (ramipril 2,5 mg/td), acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/od), clopidogrel (75 mg/od), statins (simvastatin 40 mg/od), and proton-pump inhibitors (esomeprazol 20 mg/od). Echocardiography on day 3, as well as contrast enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMI) on day 5, still showed a moderate reduced ejection fraction with typical apical ballooning. CMI showed a hyperenhancement confined to the lateral wall . A left ventricular hypertrophy, a dynamic LVOT obstruction, or a valvular heart disease was not observed on echocardiography or on CMI. ECG on day 7 showed a sinus rhythm and T-inversions in the leads V2–V6. Echocardiography on day 11 showed a mildly reduced ejection fraction. Wall motion abnormalities in the apical regions were not present anymore. Only an impaired lateral contractility could still be observed. Her recovery was uneventful, and she was doing well at discharge. She was discharged with a chronic medication including betablockers (metoprolol 47,5 mg/td), ACE-inhibitors (ramipril 2,5 mg/td), acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/od), clopidogrel (75 mg/od), statins (simvastatin 40 mg/od), and proton-pump inhibitors (esomeprazol 20 mg/od).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and ST-elevations in the leads II, aVF, and V2–V6. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Coronary angiography revealing a 50% stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery and a subtotal occlusion (99%) of the circumflex coronary artery. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Coronary angiography revealing a 50% stenosis in the right coronary artery. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Angiogram showing a left ventricular dysfunction with preserved basal function and moderate-to-severe dysfunction in the midventricle and apical regions. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a hyper-enhancement confined to the lateral wall. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】The pathogenesis of the TCM is still obscure. Catecholamine-mediated cardiotoxicity provoked by emotional or physical stress, multivessel coronary vasospasm and abnormalities in coronary microvascular function have been proposed as explanations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 7\\]</u>. Higher admission levels of plasma catecholamine in patients with TCM compared to patients with Killip class III myocardial infarction described by Wittstein and colleagues support that exaggeration of sympathetic stimulation is central to the cause of this syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 7\\]</u>. In addition, Takotsubo-like LV dysfunction was seen in patients with pheochromocytoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In the present case the patient did not report about emotional stress preceding chest pain. Unfortunately plasma levels of catecholamines were not measured in this case. However, STEMI is frequently associated with emotional stress. TCM affects, like in the present case report, predominantly postmenopausal women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The estrogen deficiency seems to play a major role in this syndrome. Due to the clinical symptoms which include chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, and elevated myocardial markers, TCM is frequently mimicking ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the absence of a significant coronary artery disease. Otherwise it has been reported that an acute occlusion of a large “wrap-around” LAD, extending to the inferior wall, can produce a typical Takotsubo contraction pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Chao and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> reported that the Takotsubo contraction pattern was found in a significant percentage of patients with acute LAD occlusion and an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In this setting it has to be considered that angiography detects only atherosclerotic plaques that encroach on the lumen and may not detect lipid-rich plaques that have undergone positive remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Such plaques may not be detected on angiogram but carry the potential for transient clot formation and spasm. Therefore, LV stunning due to transient occlusion of the LAD as a part of the usual atherosclerotic process has to be considered as a reason for Takotsubo like LV dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The subtotal occlusion of the circumflex artery explains only lateral and may be inferior wall motion abnormalities. However, the subtotal occlusion of the circumflex artery does not explain the severe dysfunction in the apical regions. In addition LV stunning would only be expected in the territory of the circumflex coronary artery (infarct vessel). Moreover the wall motion abnormalities in the apical regions disappeared after 11 days. Only an impaired lateral contractility (territory of the circumflex coronary artery/infarct vessel) could still be observed. In addition, only an isolated hyper-enhancement confined to the lateral wall (territory of the circumflex coronary artery/infarct vessel) was displayed on the MRI. Thus, transient clot formations in the LAD or in the right coronary artery were unlikely. Therefore, in the present case TCM was most likely triggered by an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of STEMI associated with TCM.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:20:56", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:21:01", "cost": 5.026}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:21:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:20:55"}

The condition typically begins with an oropharyngeal infection and frequently involves inflammation within the wall of the vein, infected thrombus within the lumen, surrounding soft tissue inflammation, persistent bacteremia, and septic emboli. Lemierre's syndrome is a rare disease; it occurs most commonly in otherwise healthy young adults. The most common etiologic agent is Fusobacterium necrophorum. We present a case of Lemierre's syndrome in a young girl and the role of extracorporeal method of blood purification with continuous venous hemodiafiltration with the use of a highly adsorptive membrane (AN69 HeprAN), thus achieving the combined elimination of cytokines and endotoxins. The use of advanced methods, along with an antibiotic and surgical treatment, will certainly help reduce mortality in this syndrome.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Lemierre's syndrome is characterized by the thrombosis of the internal jugular vein that develops following an oropharyngeal infection. Sepsis and septic metastases frequently affect the lungs, the musculoskeletal system, and, occasionally, the liver. The most common offending micro-organism is Fusobacterium necrophorum. Traditional treatment modalities used are antimicrobial, anticoagulant, and surgical treatment. A beta-lactamase-resistant beta-lactam antibiotic is recommended as an empiric therapy. Antibiotics should be tailored to the culture results and susceptibility data when available. Alternative options include clindamycin or metronidazole for patients with significant clinical allergy to beta-lactams. Morbidity is significant with prolonged hospitalization in the majority of patients. The overall mortality rate is 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In 1936, Lemierre described a syndrome that was characterized by anaerobic septicemia, internal jugular vein thrombosis, and septic emboli that are secondary to infections of the head and neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Lemierre is not the first to describe the syndrome, but because of his contribution to presentation in the literature, the syndrome was named after him. Lemierre’s syndrome is basically a septic condition, and it is associated with the development of a systemic inflammatory response and with the development of multiorgan failure and poorer clinical outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Today, we increasingly talk about the concept of extracorporeal blood buffering as an additional method of treating sepsis, which contributes to the reduction of the hyperinflammatory response and the associated multiorgan dysfunction by eliminating fused cytokines and endotoxins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We present a case of Lemierre’s syndrome in a young girl and the role of extracorporeal method of blood purification with continuous venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) with the use of a highly adsorptive membrane, thus achieving a combined elimination of cytokines and endotoxins. This case describes for the first time the use of the method, CVVHDF with a highly adsorptive membrane, in addition to antibiotic therapy, in order to control the inflammatory response and reduce the further development of multiorgan injury.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 19-year-old female without a significant past medical history was urgently admitted to hospital in a serious general condition, presenting with multiorgan failure. The infection with SARS-CoV-2 was ruled out upon admission. She was treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin on an outpatient basis for acute tonsillopharyngitis 3 weeks earlier. 2-3 days before admission, she had a fever up to 40°C, with pain in the right shoulder and right side of the chest, felt a shortness of breath on exertion, and had a dry cough. Upon admission to the hospital, she presented with fever and was hypodynamic, pale, hypotensive, and oligoanuric. The vital signs showed a low blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg, and there was a swelling of the right side of the neck and the right arm. The initial chest X-ray showed subcutaneous emphysema of the right shoulder and hemithorax, bilateral inflammatory infiltrates, and pleural effusions. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest, and abdomen showed a right parapharyngeal abscess and right jugular vein thrombosis . Gas inclusions and fluid collection were visible in the upper mediastinum accompanied with reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy, edematous adipose tissue, bilateral pulmonary consolidations, and hepatosplenomegaly . Blood tests revealed an elevated white blood cell count (24.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), anemia (hemoglobin level: 82 g/L; hematocrit level: 0.266), and renal failure (blood urea nitrogen: 34.7 mmol/L; creatinine level: 138 μmol/L). The C-reactive protein (CRP) level was also elevated at 190.2 mg/L, as well as other parameters of acute inflammation like interleukin-6 (10700.0 ng/L), ferritin (240.7 μg/L), and procalcitonin (PCT) (3.83 μg/L). On the same day, an emergency surgery was performed: a total exploration of the complete retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and retroesopharyngeal space to the depth of the aortic arch was performed. On the second day of hospitalization, due to a persistent increase in the inflammatory parameters, the CVVHDF method was performed with the adsorptive membrane (AN69 HeprAN) for 72 h. Fusobacterium necrophorum was isolated by a microbiological analysis of an intraoperative sample. Four days later, a surgical revision of the operative area of the neck was performed due to additional surgical debridement of the wound under general anesthesia. A follow-up blood test after the start of the CVVHDF method with the appropriate membrane showed decline in the inflammatory parameters with the CRP value of 126 mg/L, interleukin-6 of 0.12 ng/L, and PCT of 0.41 μg/L. On the seventh day of hospitalization, the inflammatory parameters further declined and the follow-up CT showed regression of previously described inflammatory changes. The patient was extubated and showed a stable respiratory rate, breathing through the tracheal cannula. Since the admission of the patient, an empiric antibiotic therapy was started with intravenous meronem, with subsequent introduction of linezolid and metronidazole, as well as the anticoagulant therapy of low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin). Antibiotic therapy was used for a total of up to 6 weeks. After hospital discharge, the anticoagulant therapy was continued with rivaroxaban for another 4 weeks; after a follow-up neck and chest CT confirmed complete recanalization of the right jugular vein, this was excluded from the therapy.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Neck computed tomography scan, coronal reconstruction, shows a thrombus in the right internal jugular vein 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>, hypodense fluid collection in the ipsilateral parapharyngeal space 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>, and gas inclusions in the supraclavicular region 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Chest computed tomography scan, coronal reconstruction, shows multiple bilateral nodular pulmonary consolidations .</u>\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】A clear clinical presentation of Lemierre's syndrome after the performed diagnostic tests is in line with the previous research 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Our diagnosis was based on a triass of a recent pharyngeal illness, complicated by septic emboli, and the internal jugular vein thrombosis. Subsequent microbiological analysis served as the confirmation of Fusobacterium necrophorum infection, which represents 30% of all causes of Lemierre's syndrome. Fusobacterium necrophorum is an obligate anaerobic bacterium and is notoriously difficult to culture, requiring a longer incubation period than the other bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In the case of our patient, although treatment with antibiotic therapy was initiated immediately following the surgery, a blood purification procedure was performed on the second day, which was not stated as a common procedure in the treatment of Lemierre's syndrome. So far, a case of need for renal replacement therapy has been described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case, in addition to established treatment methods that include surgery and antimicrobial therapy, we decided to include the extracorporeal blood purification with regard to pronounced laboratory signs of hyperinflammatory response, in order to prevent the multiorganic failure caused by systemic inflammatory response. As a method of blood purification, we used CVVHDF with the use of adsorptive membrane (AN69 HeprAN), which was primarily founded for the treatment of Gram-negative sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This treatment approach has already been described in other case reports of patients with Gram-negative sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Moreover, our use of CVVHDF with the adsorptive membrane (AN69 HeprAN) for 72 h led to the significant decrease in inflammatory factor levels. Interleukin-6 played an important role in monitoring the effect of CVVHDF, as it has been shown in our case. Because the antibiotic therapy killed the bacteria and the adsorptive membrane (AN69 HeprAN) removed the endotoxin and inflammatory mediators, this led to the reduction of the inflammation and allowed recovery from this acute illness. Although the use of this method did not shorten the length of hospitalization in this patient, but in the initial phase of treatment, the elimination of inflammatory mediators reduced the repercussions of hyperinflammatory responses. It is important to emphasize that CVVHDF with the adsorptive membrane was applied immediately at the beginning of treatment before we had a targeted antibiotic treatment.\n\n【10】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【11】Lemierre's syndrome is a rare illness in the modern era of antibiotic therapy which occurs primarily in young, otherwise healthy individuals. It is characterized by the presence of recent oropharyngeal infection, clinical or radiological evidence of venous thrombosis internal jugular vein, and the presence of anaerobic bacteremia caused primarily by Fusobacterium necrophorum. Prolonged antibiotic and anticoagulation therapy is the basis of the treatment. In a critical patient with a septic shock, as part of Lemierre's syndrome, it is an important adjunctive consideration to supplement the definitive source control and antimicrobial therapy. The use of extracorporeal blood purification in this case proved to be extremely important in preventing the consequences, such as multiorganic injury and faster recovery of the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:41", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:47", "cost": 6.359}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:41"}

Despite being a diagnostic challenge, these patients can be well managed with immunosuppressive therapy if recognized in time.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Although eosinophilia is commonly seen in rheumatological conditions such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and less commonly in dermatomyositis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, progressive systemic sclerosis, and Sjögren syndrome, it has been rarely described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Here, we present a case of 17-year male who presented to our center with multisystem involvement and was diagnosed to have eosinophilic vasculitis with SLE.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 17-year-male presented to our center with multiple skin lesions on bilateral lower limbs for 7 months. It started as painless, clear fluid-filled vesicles which later drained pus and resolved spontaneously. One month before the hospital presentation, he had 10–14 episodes of small-volume loose stool with mucus which lasted for 14 days. The diarrhea was not associated with fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Subsequently, he developed sharp, nonradiating pain at the tip of the left 2nd toe which progressed to dry gangrene involving half of the phalanx. He also complained of bilateral lower limb swelling and facial puffiness which subsided by the evening. He also had a productive cough with streaky hemoptysis without chest pain and shortness of breath. He also complained of fatigue, anorexia, and significant weight loss. There was no history of excessive hair fall, ear discharge, joint pain, malar rash, photosensitivity, oral and nasal ulcers, lumps and swelling, and muscle weakness. Patient did not have any comorbidities and has no history of any drug intake. A comprehensive timeline of his symptoms is shown in Figure 1.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Timeline of symptoms onset.</u>\n\n【7】On examination, pallor was present. Bilateral dorsalis pedis and left posterior tibial artery pulse were not palpable. Dry gangrene in the left second toe with a sharp line of demarcation was evident . Patchy loss of hair over bilateral toes was seen. Multiple skin lesions with central hypopigmentation and perilesional hyperpigmentation were seen on the bilateral lower limbs . There was diminished movement on the left side of the chest with a woody dull note on percussion and decreased vesicular breath sound.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Dry gangrene in the left second toe.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Multiple skin lesions with central hypopigmentation and perilesional hyperpigmentation.</u>\n\n【10】The hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin of 9.1 gm/dl) and eosinophilia (a total leucocyte count of 28560/mm<sup>3</sup> with 36% eosinophils and an absolute eosinophil count of 10288/mm<sup>3</sup>). Inflammatory markers were raised (ESR 73 mm/hour and high sensitivity C-reactive protein 10680 ng/ml). His activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 37.7 s (control 29 s). On urinalysis, proteinuria was 1+ with a dipstick without active sediments, and 24-hour urine protein (UP) was 3.17 g/day. Peripheral blood smear showed increased corrected retics count and lactate dehydrogenase along with positive direct Coomb’s test .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory findings of the patient.</u>\n\n【12】Antinuclear antibody (ANA) tested positive with a homogeneous pattern and intensity of 3+ on immunofluorescence; however, his ANA immunoblot was negative. His dsDNA was raised, and antiphospholipid syndrome workup showed a borderline raised level of lupus anticoagulants and normal titres of anticardiolipin and anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibody. His C3 and C4 levels were normal .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Serum antibody testing and its results of the patient.</u>\n\n【14】Contrast-enhanced computed axial tomography scan (CECT) of the chest and pulmonary angiography was done that revealed multiple intermediate-walled cavitary lesions in the bilateral lower lobes. A biopsy from the left lower lobe was done which revealed necrotic tissue. Other laboratory results did not show any signs of renal, electrolyte, or hepatic abnormalities. The Mantoux test and sputum for acid-fast bacilli yielded negative results. Tests for hepatitis A, B, and C, HIV1 and 2, and leptospirosis were negative. Repeated examination of blood, urine, sputum, and stool for bacterial and parasitic infection revealed no abnormalities. The stool revealed no RBC, parasite, egg, ova, or cyst.\n\n【15】He was started on high-dose oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg), mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, and anticoagulation. One week after the commencement of immunosuppressive therapy, 24-hour UP decreased to 0.29 g/day, and his hemogram revealed a decrease in eosinophil count to 13%. Three months later, on follow-up, the patient was symptom-free, and his absolute eosinophil count and 24-hour UP normalized to normal range.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disorder with varying involvement of different organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【18】In our case, there was the involvement of the vascular, hematological, respiratory, and renal systems. The investigation confirmed the diagnosis of SLE and persistent hypereosinophilia. Additional laboratory investigation was warranted to determine the cause of eosinophilia which included peripheral blood smear (for hematological malignancies), serological tests for hepatitis A, B, and C, HIV1 and 2, leptospirosis, blood, stool, and urine examination and culture. None of the tests were conclusive. There was no evidence for tuberculosis and aspergillosis as X-ray, CT scan, Mantoux test, and sputum for acid-fast bacilli yielded equivocal results. There was no evidence of parasitic infections. We planned to perform a tissue biopsy of the skin lesion and renal biopsy but could not be done as the biopsy specimen had to be sent to another country (for immunofluorescence), and it was unfeasible amidst COVID-19 nation-wide lockdown.\n\n【19】This manuscript not only points the unusual presentation of SLE with eosinophilia but also its presentation in a young male. SLE is more prevalent in female of child bearing age; however, it has various manifestations which vary according to the age group and gender because of difference in their pathogenetic mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Based on the history, clinical examination, and serum antibody positive for ANA, dsDNA, and lupus anticoagulant, we made a diagnosis of eosinophilic vasculitis with SLE with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAs). He can be diagnosed to have SLE on the basis of 2012 SLICC criteria as well as 2019 EULAR/ACR criterion. Positive ANA along with proteinuria >0.5 g/day with positive lupus anticoagulant and anti-ds DNA gives ≥10 with at least one clinical criterion point the diagnosis of SLE according to 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria for SLE. The diagnosis was further supported by a marked response to corticosteroid and MMF therapy. The main limitation and diagnostic challenge in our diagnosis was the unavailability of histopathological study of tissue biopsy of the skin lesions which would have guided our diagnosis of eosinophilic vasculitis earlier.\n\n【20】The other differential diagnoses to this presentation of this condition are parasitic infection, drug-induced lupus, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In this patient, serological tests and stool examination were carried out to exclude the presence of parasites, and no clinical signs of parasitic infection were present. Stool and serological tests were also negative for parasitic infection. The absence of intake of any drugs and negative antihistone antibody ruled out the possibility of drug-induced lupus. Although eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a possible diagnosis for this patient, negative P-ANCA and fulfilment of EULAR criteria make the diagnosis of SLE more favorable than eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\n\n【21】Increased serum LDH along with increased retics count in peripheral blood smear along with positive direct Coomb’s test points that the cause of anemia in this case be autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The discordance between the proteinuria and anemia shall be nothing more than a mere coincidence. The presence of AIHA further adds to the positive correlation of this case to SLE.\n\n【22】Eosinophilia in the absence of coexisting allergy or parasitic infection is rarely seen in SLE patients. Eosinophilia with multiple organ/system involvement suggests eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss vasculitis) as the primary working diagnosis. In the evaluation of such patients, it is recommended to test for toxocariasis, Aspergillus species (to evaluate for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis), and human immunodeficiency virus. The laboratory investigations should include vitamin B12 level (to evaluate for myeloproliferative hypereosinophilic syndrome), peripheral blood smear (to look for dysplastic eosinophils or blasts suggestive of primary eosinophilic bone marrow process), and chest computed tomography scan (to evaluate for lung involvement) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Several reports have described eosinophilic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, eosinophilic gastroenteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>, Loffler’s endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>, eosinophilic pruritic cutaneous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, and nonerosive arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. All of the cases possessed diagnostic difficulty due to the rarity of the case. In most of the reported cases of SLE with eosinophilia, it was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators, and all cases responded well. In one case reported by Thomeer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, after the patient was clinically improved with the treatment, he died and a postmortem diagnosis of Loffler’s syndrome was made. In another case report by Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, who used low-dose prednisolone (10–30 mg/day) for hypereosinophilic syndrome with SLE, there was no improvement in cutaneous manifestations.

We followed up the relief of symptoms and long-term, over-a-year microbiota stabilization in a 46-year-old man, who underwent FMT for antibiotic-induced, non-CDI colitis nine months after being treated for CDI by FMT. Fecal and mucosal microbiota was analyzed before the second FMT and during 14 months after FMT by using a high-throughput phylogenetic microarray. FMT resolved the symptoms and restored normal GI-function. Microbiota analysis revealed increased bacterial diversity in the rectal mucosa and a stable fecal microbiota up to three months after FMT. A number of mucosa-associated bacteria increased after FMT and some of these bacteria remained increased in feces up to 14 months. Notably, the increased bacteria included Bifidobacterium spp. and various representatives of Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, such as Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, and C. colinum, which are presumed to be anti-inflammatory. The presented case suggests a possible role of microbiota in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality and improves our knowledge on the etiology of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The intestinal tract harbors an extremely diverse microbiota, which is crucial in maintaining immunological and physiological homeostasis of the mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Dysbiosis of microbiota (aberrant composition) can lead to loss of normal, regulatory immune effects in the gut mucosa, and dysbiotic microbiota has been associated with a number of inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. A recent hypothesis presents that, after epithelial insult by a pathogen or an injury, specific symbiotic bacteria are needed to restore mucosal homeostasis back to a basal level by ceasing the acute inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In support of the hypothesis, a community of 17 intestinal strains attenuated intestinal inflammation by stimulating regulatory T cells in a mouse colitis model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>, and it is increasingly considered also for the treatment of noninfectious colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This report describes treatment of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis by FMT nine months after the first FMT treatment for CDI and the stabilization of intestinal microbiota in a 46-year-old man during 14 months after the second FMT.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】##### 2.1. The Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient was a 46-year-old man with history of hypertension and ventricular extrasystolia, which were being controlled by medication. He had no known allergies, and he had travelled only in Western Europe. He smoked. He had had several sinusitis episodes. Two years before the onset of refractory Clostridium difficile infection, he had septic infection due to the axillar bursitis. His uncle has Crohn’s disease.\n\n【7】The patient had Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), after amoxicillin clavulanate treatment for otitis media. CDI was verified by cultivation of C. difficile and positive toxin test of feces (VIDAS C. difficile Toxin A & B CDAB, BioMerieux, France). No resolution of symptoms was achieved with oral metronidazole (400 mg thrice a day) or vancomycin (first 120 mg four times a day and later 250 mg four times a day). Because of refractory situation, patient was hospitalized and the treatment was switched to meropenem (1 g thrice a day intravenously) and rifaximin (400 mg twice a day). In addition, he got one dose of immunoglobulin 27.5 g intravenously. After six days of treatment, the patient was discharged with ten days of rifaximin (400 mg twice a day) treatment. Three days after stopping the rifaximin treatment, the symptoms reappeared including 10 diarrhea episodes per day. The patient restarted rifaximin treatment and continued it until colonoscopy and FMT were done three weeks later. Mild nonspecific proctitis was found in colonoscopy. The histology showed postinfectious inflammation and no typical signs of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. FMT was performed by infusing fecal suspension into the caecum. The diarrhea disappeared within two days after FMT.\n\n【8】Seven months after FMT, the patient got clarithromycin for sinusitis and diarrhea reappeared. Symptoms were not as severe as earlier; that is, he had 5-6 diarrhea episodes per day and urgency of defecation. No C. difficile or toxins were found in feces by cultivation or toxin tests, respectively. The symptoms did not resolve spontaneously during 8 weeks after the cessation of clarithromycin. Colonoscopy was reassessed to exclude chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The macroscopic and microscopic findings were similar as seen previously, that is, mild inflammation. Fecal calprotectin was also tested and was 12 μg/g. The patient received the second FMT and thereafter he has had no GI-symptoms (two and a half years by the time of submitting this report). The patient had three antibiotic courses during the follow-up period between 10 and 12 months after the second FMT.\n\n【9】##### 2.2. The Donor and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT)\n\n【10】The donor of fecal material in both transplantations was the patient’s 35-year-old wife, who was pregnant at the time of the second FMT. She had not received antimicrobial therapy for the past 6 months and did not have any intestinal symptoms. She was tested by the protocol for fecal donors as described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Thirty grams of the donor’s feces were suspended into 150 mL of tap water and the suspension was infused into the caecum through colonoscopy as described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【11】##### 2.3. Samples and Microbiota Analysis\n\n【12】Rectal biopsies were taken from the patient at the time of the second FMT and one month later in proctoscopy and stored in −80°C until further processing. The patient and donor collected fecal samples after the second FMT according to the sampling scheme presented in Figure 1. The fecal samples were placed in a home freezer at −20°C immediately after defecation and stored in the home freezer for maximally 4 months until transfer to laboratory for further analysis. Six healthy adult volunteers (3 males and 3 females, mean age 67 years), who underwent diagnostic colonoscopy and were found to have a healthy intestine, were included as a comparison group for mucosa-associated microbiota. DNA extraction was done as described previously by using mechanical disruption of bacterial cells by bead-beating followed by DNA purification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Microbiota analysis was done by using the HITChip high-throughput bacterial phylogenetic microarray as described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–11\\]</u>.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Microbiota composition at the phylum level and bacterial genus level enterotype (ET) status before FMT and during the 14-month follow-up period.</u>\n\n【14】##### 2.4. Ethical Considerations\n\n【15】The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS), Finland (Dnro HUS 124/13/03/01/11). The patient was informed about the experimental nature and possible risks of FMT. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and donor for publication of this case report. The healthy volunteers who donated biopsies signed informed consent.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【17】##### 3.1. Resolution of GI-Symptoms by FMT\n\n【18】The patient’s recurrent Clostridium difficile infection was successfully treated by FMT. Seven months later, he got antibiotic-induced diarrhea, which was not as severe as earlier. Also, no C. difficile or toxins were found in feces. The symptoms did not resolve spontaneously within eight weeks after stopping the antibiotic. Colonoscopy excluded inflammatory bowel disease, but mild inflammation was observed. The patient received FMT again and the GI-symptoms were resolved within few days. The patient had three antibiotic courses during the follow-up period between 10 and 12 months after the second FMT, but these antibiotic treatments did not induce diarrhea.\n\n【19】##### 3.2. Fecal Microbiota of the Donor\n\n【20】In general, fecal microbiota of the donor was found to be stable during the 14-month follow-up period, but a decrease in stability was observed between 2-day and 2-week and 4- and 7-month samples, that is, approximately one month before and three months after the delivery, respectively . The most predominating phylum was Firmicutes, where Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa and uncultured Clostridiales were the largest groups . Phylum Bacteroidetes constituted 2–13% and Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria less than 4% of the total microbiota in the donor . In the enterotype (ET) profiling, the donor’s fecal microbiota represented ET3, that is, the Ruminococcus enterotype . The diversity and richness of fecal microbiota were higher in the donor than in the patient throughout the follow-up period .\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Stability of the fecal microbiota determined as Pearson correlation of the microbiota profiles between the subsequent sampling points.</u>\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Diversity and richness of microbiota in the fecal samples (a and c) and in mucosal biopsies from the patient and six healthy controls (b and d). 0 d: pre-FMT sample; 2 wk to 14 mo: post-FMT samples. Line connects the rectal and ileal samples from the same individual.</u>\n\n【23】##### 3.3. Mucosal and Fecal Microbiota of the Patient during 14 Months after the FMT\n\n【24】Intestinal microbiota composition was followed up with frequent sampling during 14 months after the FMT. In the patient, a shift from a Bacteroidetes-rich fecal microbiota to a microbiota, where Firmicutes constitute over 87% of the bacterial community, was observed from two weeks after FMT onwards . Particularly, the relative proportion of Clostridium cluster XIVa increased by 20% in feces after FMT. However, in mucosa, the relative abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes increased and Firmicutes decreased after FMT. Fecal microbiota two days after FMT resembled the pre-FMT microbiota and may reflect an adaptation stage. Also, fecal microbiota enterotype (ET) profiling analysis showed a shift at 2 days after FMT. Fecal microbiota represented enterotype 3 (ET3), that is, the Ruminococcus enterotype at all other sampling points except at 2 days after FMT. In contrast, mucosal microbiota represented enterotype 2 (ET2), that is, the Prevotella enterotype . Consistently, both the phylum level and enterotype profiling, that is, genus level analysis, showed that the composition of mucosa-associated microbiota is different from that of the fecal microbiota. The patient’s fecal microbiota was stable from 2 weeks to 3 months after FMT, but then stability decreased slightly between 3 and 7 months and more notably between 7 and 14 months . From 7- to 14-month fecal samples, a shift back to a Bacteroidetes-rich fecal microbiota was seen . The shift cooccurred with the administration of three antibiotic courses between these sampling points.\n\n【25】Further, the analysis of mucosa-associated microbiota revealed a marked increase in the diversity and richness of bacterial species in post-FMT rectal biopsy as compared to the pre-FMT biopsy . The increase in diversity and richness in the patient’s rectal mucosa exceeded the interindividual variability of rectal biopsies from six healthy controls . The increase in diversity also exceeded intraindividual variability between ileal and rectal biopsies from the same individual . The results indicate that the increase in diversity and richness of the patient’s mucosal microbiota is beyond the natural variability. Thus, the mucosal microbiota of the patient seemed to be strongly affected by FMT. However, in the luminal contents (feces), the increase in bacterial diversity and richness was modest . Interestingly, the post-FMT biopsy of the patient clustered with fecal samples of the donor in hierarchical clustering of the microbiota profiles 通用删除1(英):<u>(Supplementary Figure  1 available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/913867)</u>. A number of bacterial groups in the mucosa showed either a decrease or an increase in their relative abundance after FMT . Most of these bacterial groups (46 out of 49) showed a similar difference between the donor and the pre-FMT patient fecal samples. Further, specific bacterial groups in post-FMT mucosal sample showed the same direction of change in their relative abundance in the fecal sample at 14 months after FMT and during the follow-up period from 2 weeks to 7 months (in average) as compared to the pre-FMT feces . The increased bacterial groups include Bifidobacterium spp. (Actinobacteria), Clostridium leptum et rel. Oscillospira guillermondii et rel. Sporobacter termitidis et rel. Anaerotruncus colihominis et rel. Ruminococcus callidus et rel. R. bromii et rel. (Clostridium cluster IV), Dialister spp. (Clostridium cluster IX), Lachnospira pectinoschiza et rel. C. colinum et rel. (Clostridium cluster XIVa), uncultured Clostridiales I, and Oxalobacter formigenes et rel. (Proteobacteria) . We assume that these bacterial groups have established themselves stably from the donor’s microbiota or have successfully and stably recovered from the patient’s own microbiota after FMT. On the other hand, four groups belonging to Bacteroidetes and Clostridium ramosum et rel. (Clostridium cluster XVIII) decreased after FMT both in mucosa and in feces.\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Mucosal bacteria with >2-fold change in relative abundance after FMT and constituting >0.01% of the microbiota.</u>\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【28】The case described herein presents an expansion of the use of FMT to treat antibiotic-induced, non-CDI colitis. FMT restored normal GI-function and the patient has not had GI-symptoms thereafter, that is, two and a half years at the time of writing this report.\n\n【29】Interestingly, the patient did not seem to have perturbed fecal microbiota prior to FMT. The relative proportion of Bacteroidetes was rather high, but within the normal variation in healthy Europeans adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Also, the microbiota composition of the donor was typical to healthy adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and showed high stability during the last month of pregnancy and three months postpartum, which is in line with the results from a recent study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In the patient, the proportion of Bacteroidetes still increased two days after the FMT, but later a clear shift to a Firmicutes-dominating microbiota was observed. It seems that a period ranging from few days to two weeks is needed before the establishment of post-FMT microbiota. The temporary shift of the microbiota enterotype at 2d after FMT also indicates a transition period. At the phylum level, fecal microbiota was relatively stable from two weeks up to three months after FMT. Recently, a stable phylum level microbiota composition was reported in three patients, who were followed up for 3-4 months after FMT for recurrent C. difficile infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In our patient, the diversity of microbiota decreased and the total microbiota was less stable after three months after FMT. The result indicates that microbiota evolution may continue for a considerable period of time after FMT and underlines the need for long-term post-FMT follow-up studies of microbiota stabilization.\n\n【30】In the patient, fecal and mucosal microbiota showed different compositions at both bacterial phylum and genus levels. In the enterotype profiling, fecal microbiota was found to be enterotype 3 (ET3) and mucosal microbiota enterotype 2 (ET2). The three enterotypes are each characterized by a discriminating genus, Bacteroides (ET1), Prevotella (ET2), or Ruminococcus (ET3), whose abundance correlates with the abundance of other genera 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Thus, the enterotypes are driven by groups of bacteria that together contribute to the preferred microbiota composition, which is a result of adaption to the particular environment. Interestingly, the bacterial diversity and richness were higher in the mucosal biopsies as compared to feces. Similarly, higher bacterial richness was observed in the mucosa as compared to matched fecal samples in a recent study comprising four individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Clearly, intestinal lumen and mucosa represent different environments and, consequently, harbor different microbiota.\n\n【31】We observed a shift back to a Bacteroidetes-rich fecal microbiota in the patient at 14 months after FMT. The shift was associated with the administration of three antibiotic courses, which, however, did not induce diarrhea this time. Thus, at the phylum level composition, the patient’s microbiota at 14 months resembled microbiota before FMT, but apparently he maintained some key bacterial species that could support gut functionality even when challenged by antibiotics. Indeed, we observed a drastic increase in the diversity and richness of mucosal microbiota after FMT indicating either the strong engraftment of donor’s microbiota or the recovery of patient’s own microbiota particularly in the mucosal lining. Specific mucosa-associated bacteria, which increased in abundance, showed an increase also in feces up to 14 months after FMT. The increased bacterial groups include Bifidobacterium and Dialister spp. bacteria related to Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, C. colinum, and Oxalobacter formigenes, as well as uncultured Clostridiales I. We assume that these bacterial groups have established themselves stably after FMT and may have a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis. Previously, Bifidobacterium, C. leptum, Sporobacter, Oscillospira, Anaerotruncus, R. bromii, Dialister, and uncultured Clostridiales have been found to be increased in healthy individuals as compared to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 15\\]</u>. Further, a combination of 17 strains of intestinal bacteria, belonging to the genera Ruminococcus, Anaerotruncus, Lachnospiraceae, Clostridium, Eubacterium, and Blautia, has been shown to attenuate inflammation in a mouse colitis model by stimulating regulatory T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As an exception, O. formigenes has no reported anti-inflammatory effects but is associated with a reduced risk of calcium oxalate stone disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Collectively, our patient showed constantly increased levels of intestinal bacteria, which seem to have anti-inflammatory effects and possibly ceased the mild, on-going inflammation.\n\n【32】In the presented case, FMT resolved the symptoms in an antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis. The post-FMT bacterial community restored normal GI-function possibly by ceasing the mild, on-going inflammation. The microbiota analysis suggests that specific members of microbiota may have a role in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality. Interestingly, the 17 strains in the study by Atarashi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> exerted an anti-inflammatory effect as a community, but not as individual strains. Thus, it seems that an assembly of bacterial species, rather than a specific single species, is essential in preventing or treating intestinal diseases. Today, FMT is the most straightforward way of introducing the necessary combination of bacteria to a patient, but there is an increasing need to identify the crucial bacterial species that are able to control infection or inflammation in the intestine. The first two cases on the use of an “artificial stool” consisting of pure cultures of intestinal bacterial have shown promising results in the treatment of recurrent CDI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Clinical FMT-studies linked with microbiota analysis can greatly advance these efforts and improve our understanding of the etiology of diseases, where dysbiosis of the microbiota is considered to play a role.\n\n【33】#### 5\\.

We present a patient with pterygium colli and a low and laterally displaced nuchal hairline. Since its description, various surgical approaches have been implemented to correct the deformity. Previously reported posterior and lateral approaches have notable disadvantages with regard to hairline displacement and recurrence. In order to address these disadvantages, a new surgical technique was used on this patient. We have termed this technique an M to T rearrangement. Using a lateral approach, the M and T incisions are made and the trapezial fascial web is directly visualized and able to be completely excised. This prevents the recurrence seen with the use of posterior techniques. Inferolateral displacement of hair-bearing skin can be removed with resection of the superior intervening triangle and improves the appearance of the low nuchal hairline. The excision of excess skin along with the zig-zag closure also prevents postoperative scar contraction and recurrence. An important effect of this technique is the prevention of anterior displacement of hair bearing skin. M to T rearrangement is an effective technique for the correction of webbed neck deformities seen in Noonan and Turner syndromes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】A syndrome involving valvular pulmonary stenosis, small stature, hypertelorism, mild mental retardation, undescended testes, and skeletal abnormalities was first described by Noonan and Ehmke in 1963 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Noonan syndrome is characterized by short stature, congenital heart defect, and developmental delay of variable degree. Other findings can include broad or webbed neck, pectus deformity, cryptorchidism, characteristic facies, varied coagulation defects, lymphatic dysplasias, and ocular abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The syndrome is fairly common, as the incidence is estimated to be approximately 1 : 1,000–2,500 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance has been determined and attributed to missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12 in 50% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】For the Noonan syndrome patient, the most concerning physical defect is often congenital webbing of the neck or pterygium colli. Kobylinski initially reported this deformity in 1883 and the name “pterygium colli” was coined by Funke in 1902 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Pterygium colli involves an ectopic fibrotic facial band superficial to the trapezius muscle. Excess hair-bearing skin is also present and extends down the cervical region well beyond the normal hairline.\n\n【5】Since its description, various surgical approaches have been implemented to correct the deformity. Previously reported posterior and lateral approaches have notable disadvantages with regard to hairline displacement and recurrence. In order to address these disadvantages, a novel surgical technique was used on this patient. We have termed this technique an M to T rearrangement.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 13-year-old male was evaluated for congenital webbing of the neck secondary to Noonan syndrome. The patient presented with characteristic features of pterygium colli with a low and laterally displaced nuchal hairline. Presurgical testing did not reveal any coagulation abnormalities. These patients can often have specific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation anomalies, but none were noted with this patient. Surgical treatment was outlined to address both the neck and hairline abnormalities.\n\n【8】Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a prone position and the webbing was carefully marked from the mastoid to the acromion. A pinch test of the skin overlying the trapezius muscle was used to determine the excess . A horizontal incision was marked perpendicular to the web to form a “T.” This incision was placed parallel to a crease in the anterolateral neck. The length of this limb (releasing incision) was determined from the midpoint of the web line to the palpated edge of the pinch test.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | A pinch test of the skin overlying the trapezius muscle was used to determine the excess. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【10】A triangular flap whose apex was at the intersection of the limbs of the “T” was then marked. An equilateral triangle, with the limbs and base of the triangle measuring the same length as the releasing incision, was marked. It is paramount to orient the triangular flap in such a way so to exclude any hair-bearing skin that is commonly present in a patient with inferolateral displacement of the hairline. The base of the triangular flap is then connected to the superior and inferior edges of the webbing to form an “M” .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Markings for an M-T rearrangement.

This is an equilateral triangle, with the limbs and base of the triangle measuring the same length as the releasing incision. The base of the triangular flap is then connected to the superior and inferior edges of the webbing to form an “M.” Note that the inferolateral displacement of hair-bearing skin is present within the superior triangle. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】The M and T incisions were made along the markings. The skin and subcutaneous tissue of the two intervening triangles that are present superior and inferior to the triangular flap were resected. The superior triangle usually incorporates the inferior and lateral displaced hairline and hair bearing skin. Then the fibrotic fascial band of the trapezius is fully visualized . The most important part of the procedure is to perform a complete excision of the trapezial fascial web in order to prevent recurrence. This effectively lengthened the trapezius and improved the neck profile . Meticulous dissection is required to visualize the spinal accessory nerve and protect it from injury.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | A lateral approach allows for complete visualization of fibrotic fascial band on the trapezius muscle.

The hairline was improved by resection of hair-bearing skin within the superior intervening triangle. No recurrence was noted at the one-year followup . The patient did have hypertrophic scarring throughout both incisions. At the one-year followup, scar revision was offered.

Discussion\n\n【21】Numerous surgical approaches have been developed to correct the webbed neck deformity seen in Noonan’s and Turner’s syndromes. The primary goals of correction include normalizing the appearance of the neck, raising the low hairline. Previously reported techniques have attempted correction from lateral or posterior approaches.\n\n【22】In 1937, Chandler originally proposed surgical correction of the deformity via bilateral Z-plasties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A lateral approach allows for complete visualization of the web, but the use of a Z-plasty alone does not fully achieve desired aesthetic results. With this technique, the hair-bearing flap is rotated anteriorly and is visible on the lateral neck. Although the width of the neck is improved, future hair removal procedures would be indicated to achieve a normal appearance. Hikade et al. improved upon this technique by developing a modified Z-plasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. With this approach a lateral Z-plasty is performed, the hair-bearing flap is excised, and the resultant dog-ear is corrected by two additional Z-plasties. This allows for visualization of the web and eliminates the need for future hair removal on the lateral neck. Although a modified Z-plasty does achieve the goals of webbed neck correction, scars extend from just below the mastoid process to the acromion.\n\n【23】With a posterior approach, excess skin is excised from midline of the posterior neck. This flattens the web against the lateral neck to achieve an improved appearance. Shearin and DeFranzo described a posterior butterfly correction of a webbed neck deformity in a Turner’s patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Tension on the vertical limb of the scar caused considerable spreading and recurrence of the web. Similarly, Thomson et al. used a posterior approach and excised a midline ellipse of tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The incision and resultant dog ears were closed leaving a Y-shaped scar. As was also described by Shearin and DeFranzo, the vertical limb of this scar is under considerable tension, which makes recurrence of the web possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Hypertrophic scarring was noted postoperatively in this case. A recent study noted that five out of eleven patients had mild to moderate postoperative hypertrophic scarring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. They found that lateral techniques with incorporation of Z-plasties provided superior results. They showed, as with our patient, that overall patient satisfaction is very high but recommended accurate preoperative planning and counseling of patients and families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The M to T rearrangement described in this report offers considerable advantages to previously reported techniques. By using a lateral approach, the trapezial fascial web is directly visualized and able to be completely excised. This prevents the recurrence seen with the use of posterior techniques. Inferolateral displacement of hair-bearing skin can be removed with resection of the superior intervening triangle and improves the appearance of the low nuchal hairline. The excision of excess skin along with the zig-zag closure also prevents postoperative scar contraction and recurrence. An important effect of this technique is the prevention of anterior displacement of hair bearing skin. M to T rearrangement is a novel technique for effective surgical correction of webbed neck deformities seen in Noonan’s and Turner’s syndromes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:04:20", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:04:36", "cost": 15.412}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:04:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:04:19"}

Three primary fallopian tube carcinomas, arising in a background of chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), are presented. The possible association between chronic PID and PFTC is discussed and a hypothesies linking these cancers with chronic inflammation is proposed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primary fallopian tube cancer (PFTC) is a relatively aggressive gynaecological malignancy. It accounts for 1% of all female genital malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. The aetiology of PFTC is unknown but nulliparous women and women with germ-line BRCA mutation and women in certain occupations such as smelting workers, artistic workers, hairdressers, packers, nurses, shop workers, and clerical workers appear to be at increased risk of PFTC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>. Serous papillary carcinoma is the most common histological type, accounting for >90% of the cases with these tumours. PID is very common and Chlamydia trachomatis infection is one of the most significant causes of chronic uterine tube inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Chlamydial infection has been associated with certain cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9, 10\\]</u>. This paper describes 3 cases of PFTC, clinically presenting as tuboovarian abscesses. A possible link between chronic PID and PFTC is suggested.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】Three cases of primary fallopian tube carcinomas, presenting between April 2011 and August 2013 with a clinical impression of an inflammatory tuboovarian mass, are described.\n\n【6】Case 1 is a 46-year-old Indigenous woman, admitted in April 2011 with pelvic pain. Abdominal ultrasound showed a 130 mm complex left cystic adnexal mass which was clinically considered to be a tuboovarian abscess as there was a longstanding history of PID due to Chlamydia and gonorrhoea. No free fluid was seen in the pelvis and a CA-125 was normal. Abdominal computerised tomography confirmed the adnexal lesion but showed no additional masses. She had recently been investigated for menorrhagia and her endometrial biopsy and cervical cytology had been normal. She has type 2 diabetes and hypertension. On vaginal examination a large left sided pelvic mass was felt. At laparotomy there were dense adhesions between the adnexae, uterus, and bowel. The adnexae were completely obscured by scar tissues. She underwent hysterectomy left salpingo-oophorectomy and omental biopsy. Macroscopically, the left adnexa ( mm) hands a globular tan brown cystic appearance with a thickened fleshy wall and multiple fleshy projections into the lumen . A high grade mainly solid serous carcinoma was seen in the tube microscopically . Although the fallopian tube was almost completely destroyed by scar tissue from past PID, close relationship to uninvolved and “premalignant” dysplastic tubal epithelia could be microscopically established . The ovary was not identified. The tumour appeared to be limited to the tube and was staged as TNM stage pT1A . The tubal cancer was regarded as a primary fallopian tubal carcinoma, for which the patient received 6 cycles of postoperative adjuvant therapy. Posttreatment restaging CT 6 weeks later was normal and serial serum CA-125 measurements remained normal. The patient is alive and apparently disease free.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) is the macroscopic image of the left fallopian tube which is totally destroyed and cystic.

She also complained of intermenstrual bleeding and had previously been treated for PID due to Chlamydia. Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy in 2010 revealed no pathology and her cervical cytology was also normal. CT abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral adnexal cysts with the right measuring 120 mm and the left measuring 102 mm. Fluid-filled tubal structures were noted in close proximity of the cystic lesions on both sides. Some of the right-sided cysts communicated directly with the fallopian tube. There was also a heterogeneous thick-walled cystic lesion in the vicinity of the right-sided fluid-filled tube. These were interpreted as inflammatory collections. CA-125 was markedly elevated at 1900 kU/L (reference range < 35 kU/L). She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In view of her clinical status and the presence of adhesions, temporary large bowel enterostomy and peritoneal washings were also performed. Macroscopic examination showed a uterus, cervix, tubes, and ovaries, 266 gm. The uterine corpus contained multiple leiomyomas but the cervix appeared unremarkable. The left ( mm) and right ( mm) adnexae were distorted by cystic lesions. Both tubes also had multiple tan and brown polypoid luminal areas . Histologically, a high grade serous cystadenocarcinoma, originating from the right fallopian tube and involving both adnexal regions and greater omentum , was identified. PID was also identified. No normal ovarian tissue was recognised. The cervix, endometrium, and myometrium showed no malignancy. The peritoneal washings revealed inflammatory material only. The tumour was staged as INM pT3aNXMX . She received chemotherapy and is being followed up with no evidence of disease recurrence clinically or by CA-125 levels.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | (a) is the macroscopic image of the left fallopian tube which shows a cross section of sausage-like white fleshy mass within what appears to be part of the tube.

She had a history of chronic PID due to Chlamydia. Ultrasound examination confirmed bilateral hydrosalpinx and also a large uterine mass. Her CA-125, CA-19.9, and CEA were normal. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and peritoneal washings were performed. Macroscopically, the uterus contained a somewhat polypoid endometrial lesion 62 mm and several small leiomyomas up to 15 mm . The right adnexa, which weighed 252 g and measured  mm, consisted of a cystic mass filled with creamy material. The cystic tubal wall ranged in thickness from 1 mm to 4 mm. A polypoid yellowish tan lesion  mm was seen on the inner surface of the right tube, Figure 3(a). The left adnexa consisted of tuboovarian tissue  mm with a recognisible ovary  mm. The tube was dilated and filled with haemorrhagic fluid. Multiple septae ranging from 5 mm to 25 mm in length were seen inside the left tube . The uterine lesion was a FIGO grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma. The tumour had extended into the outer myometrium but was clear by 2.5 mm. The endocervix was also involved by carcinoma . The tumour expressed vimentin and oestrogen receptor . CD10 was expressed only in the stroma of the normal endometrium  and CA126 along the luminal border of the malignant glands . The right tube showed xanthomatous salpingitis . The mucosal nodule was a high grade endometrioid carcinoma  which had a similar immunohistochemical profile to the uterine tumour in being oestrogen receptor positive. Vimentin was also positive. CD10 was non contributory and CA125 was expressed along the luminal surface of the malignant glands. In addition, the right tubal epithelial lining also showed high grade dysplasia . The dysplastic epithelium also expressed vimentin, oestrogen receptor, and luminal surface CA125. Both tubes also showed features of hydrosalpynx. The inflammatory process in the left tube was nonspecific  in comparison to the xanthomatous inflammation in the right tube, as previously mentioned . Close examination of the epithelial lining of the left tube showed focal atypia . The was no malignancy in the left tube. The right tubal cancer was limited to the tube without penetration of the serosal surface (TNM stage pT1/FIGO stage IA). Indeed the tubal tumour did not show any mural invasion . In view of the fact that the endometrioid cancer was at a higher stage, the patient was treated as having a TNM stage pT2a/Figo stage IIA. Her follow-up CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were unremarkable. The serum CA125 measurement has been normal since surgery.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | (a) The upper left panel is the macroscopic image of the right fallopian tube which is markedly distended and shows a polypoid mucosal mass (right tube).

Discussion\n\n【13】PFTC accounts for 1% of all gynaecological malignancies. In order to be considered a primary neoplasm, the tumour must be located within the fallopian tube or its fimbriated end and the uterus and ovary must either not contain carcinoma or if they do it must be clearly different from the fallopian tube lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The 3 cases presented here fulfill these criteria and are therefore considered primary fallopian tube cancers. The third case is complicated by the fact that a clinically significant primary tumour of the endometrium was also found and the operation was performed for the uterine complaints with the fallopian tube pathology being an incidental finding. The tubal tumour was considered a second primary as it formed a polypoid mucosal lesion  with precancerous changes in the mucosa at the base of the polyp . The tumour was associated with xanthomatous salpingitis . The tumour and the precancerous change were endometrioid expressing vimentin and oestrogen receptor (left and middle lower panels). The nonneoplastic tubal tissue did express oestrogen receptor weakly but was not vimentin positive (left and middle lower panels). CA125 was seen only along the luminal surface aspect of the normal, preneoplastic, and neoplastic epithelia (Lower right panel). The endometrial carcinoma showed a similar immunohistochemical profile . The left tube  was not involved by cancer but foci of atypia were seen in the lining mucosa . The tube, however, did show features of hydrosalpinx  with chronic salpingitis . The tumour in the first 2 cases was of the serous type  and in each case, precancerous changes could be demonstrated in the tube .\n\n【14】Mounting evidence indicates that the vast majority of epithelial ovarian carcinomas are not ovarian in origin. Extrauterine Müllerian epithelium from various sites in the reproductive tract accounts for the diverse morphology and behaviour of these tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomies in BRCA positive women have recently implicated the fimbria as a site of origin for high-grade serous carcinoma and its intraepithelial precursors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. Kurman et al. has proposed a model for the development of ovarian and extraovarian low-grade serous proliferations. They postulate that all of these lesions are derived from papillary tubal hyperplasia, which appears to be induced by chronic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Chronic inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of human cancers. The mechanisms underlying the relationship between inflammation and cancer are complex. The aetiology of the inflammation is varied and includes microbial, chemical, and physical agents. The chronically inflamed environment which is rich in inflammatory cytokines appears to lead to the activation of a number of signalling pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of cancer of the proximal stomach, liver, and uterine cervix with helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and C, and human papilloma viruses, respectively, is well documented. An association between chronic inflammation and fallopian tube cancer has been suggested by a number of investigators. Lin and colleagues found an association between PID and ovarian cancer and suggested that PID might be a useful marker for ovarian cancer as early detection and treatment could help to improve prognosis. They raised the possibility that pelvic inflammation might accelerate the growth of ovarian cancers or affect cancer-cell differentiation in ways that adversely alter prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Rasmussen et al. found that a history of PID was associated with an increased risk of ovarian borderline tumours and suggested that inflammation could be an etiological factor in borderline tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> and Skapinyecz et al. also found that patients suffering from PID had a higher risk of cervical cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydial and gonorrhoeal infections can damage the tubal mucosa. A 60 kDa heat shock protein is believed to be an important triggering pathogenic immune response in chlamydial infection and several studies have demonstrated a correlation between the level of immune response to this chlamydial protein and the extent of tubal damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Chlamydia trachomatis infection is one of the most significant causes of PID. The pathogen is highly prevalent in the cervix and uterine tubes of sexually active women. The probability of having ovarian cancer has been shown to be 90% greater in women with the highest levels of antibodies to chlamydia compared to women with the lowest levels, suggesting that past or chronic persistent chlamydial infection may be a risk factor for ovarian cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. This possible association was recently revived by J. P. Carvalho and F. M. Carvalho who hypothesised that chlamydial trachomatis infection might be involved in fimbrial carcinogenesis. Fimbrial intraepithelial precursors can evolve into high grade serous carcinomas that spread rapidly to the ovarian surface and peritoneum; such tumours may appear to be primary ovarian neoplasms, though in reality, they are secondary malignancies. J. P. Carvalho and F. M. Carvalho did not offer intracellular signalling pathways for their hypothesis. This hypothesis may have implications for patient management as salpingectomy instead of oophorectomy which may be more appropriate surgery for high risk women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The 3 patients presented here had long standing histories of PIC with many hospital admissions for septic conditions and menstrual irregularities. Chlamydia with or without other infections is usually present in pelvic inflammatory disease and the 3 patients had been previously treated for chlamydial infections. Chlamydia is the most frequently reported notifiable condition in Australia. In 2011 there were almost 80,000 new notifications for persons aged 15 years and over 435 cases per 100,000 population and 9% of chlamydia notifications were among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, despite this population representing just 2.5% of the total population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The notification rate for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population was nearly four times that of the non-Indigenous notification rate: 1,257 per 100,000, compared with 340 per 100,000, respectively. Similar to the non-Indigenous population, around 80% of chlamydia diagnoses were among those aged 15 to 29 years. In 2010, more than a third (36%) of all gonorrhoea diagnoses were among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The rate of diagnosis was more than 26 times that for the non-Indigenous population: 804 per 100,000, compared with 30 per 100,000, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The 3 patients presented here are from the northern territory of Australia which has a population of approximately 230,000 with 32% being Indigenous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. PID is a significant health problem in this cohort and the finding of 3 cases of PFTC is significant and raises the possibility of an association between these cancers and PID.\n\n【17】The role of chlamydial infection is firmly established in conjunctival cancers including marginal zone lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>. As chronic chlamydial infection is the most common causes of chronic uterine tube inflammation, this infection is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of tubal cancer. It is reasonable to suggest that chronic C. trachomatis infection may be involved in fimbrial carcinogenesis and subsequent serous carcinomas with the potential for rapid spread to the ovarian surface and peritoneum. This has implications for possible early detection and prophylactic salpingectomy instead of oophorectomy in high risk women.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:02", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:23", "cost": 20.981}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:02"}

The second case had clinical presentation of pulmonary thromboembolism after the patient was involved in an automobilist accident. The tumors were mainly composed of small blue cells which by immunohistochemical were positive for neural markers, and FISH revealed the translocation 22q12 for the EWSR1 gene. The diagnosis of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor is very rare and usually involves several different diagnostic techniques.

Case 1\n\n【8】A 32-year-old female presented to the emergency room with right flank pain that irradiates to the groin. She was clinically diagnostic with kidney stones and indeed a kidney stone was identified. However, the computed tomography scan revealed a large right renal mass and right ovarian cystic mass. The patient underwent a right-sided laparoscopic radical nephrectomy along with an excision of the ovarian cystic mass. Her postoperatively course was uneventful except for some pain in the surgical incision site. Grossly, an 11 cm cyst adenofibroma of the right fallopian tube and ovary was identified. In addition, the kidney showed an 8.3 cm encapsulated tumor located at the pelvic adipose tissue within the renal capsule . Microscopically, the tumor cells were arranged in solid sheets, tightly packed cords, trabeculae with variable stroma, and nests or ribbons of uniform small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm, uniform nuclei, and stippled chromatin. At places rosettes were identified . Mitotic activity was present . No necrosis was seen. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using the usual avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. The antibodies are listed in Table 1. The tumor cells were strong positive for neuron-specific enolase , CD56 , Cytokeratin AE1/3, and Cam 5.2. Weakly positive stain for PGP9.5, bcl2, and CD99 was identified. The tumor was negative for synaptophysin, EMA, inhibin, chromogranin, vimentin, WT1, S100, CK7, estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, CD10, and Carbonic anhydrase 9. Ki 67 showed a high proliferation rate index of 30% . Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using the 22q12 LSI, EWSR1, Dual-Color Break-Apart Probe was performed on fresh tissue and showed 18 (29.5%) of the cells with the translocation pattern 22q12 for the EWSR1 gene. The histomorphological, immunohistochemical profile and FISH results were consisted with a renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor.

A month later, the patient returned to the emergency room with complaints of shortness of breath, icterus, and dark urine. A chest-computed tomography scan revealed pulmonary embolism. She underwent a pulmonary embolism protocol which included a computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The exam showed extensive central bilateral pulmonary embolism and a large right atrial thrombus in continuity with thrombotic material within the inferior vena cava. In addition, her right kidney had poorly contrast-enhancing raising the possibility of a right renal vein thrombosis extending into the right atrium with subsequent pulmonary embolism. She underwent a pulmonary tumor embolectomy, right atrial mass removal, and tumor embolectomy thrombectomy of the hepatic inferior vena cava as well as placement of an inferior vena cava filter. The patient underwent a sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. She started chemotherapy with etoposide and ifosfamide combination therapy. The tumor invaded the renal vein and extended to the resection margin. The histological examination of the right atrial, pulmonary artery, and caval vein thrombus revealed islands of uniform small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm, uniform nuclei, and stippled chromatin intermixed with necrosis and blood clot . The viable tumor cells showed brisk mitosis. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using the usual avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. The antibodies are listed in Table 1. The viable tumor cells showed a strong membranous stains for CD99 , focal membranous and cytoplasm stain for CD56 , a cytoplasm dot pattern for synapthophysin , and focal cytoplasm and membranous stain for PGP9.5, BCL2, and vimentin. The lymphoid cells in the background were positive for LCA and CD43. The tumor cells are negative for CD3, CD20, CD30, alpha-fetoprotein, beta human chorionic gonadotrophin, pan-cytokeratin, CAM5.2, myogenin, epithelial membrane antigen, thyroid transcription factor-1, CK20, desmin, smooth muscle actin, HMB45, S100, and WT1. Five months later, the patient had a right nephrectomy. Grossly, the right kidney revealed multifocal tan-brown to yellow masses in the upper and lower poles ranging from 0.4 × 0.4 cm to 4.3 × 2.8 cm . Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using the 22q12 LSI, EWSR1, Dual-Color Break-Apart Probe was performed on fresh tissue and showed 57 (95.0%) of the cells with the translocation pattern 22q12 for the EWSR1 gene . In addition a FISH for the X-18 SYT translocation was performed but it was negative. The histomorphological, immunohistochemical profile and FISH results were consisted with a renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor. The patient completed her 12 months of chemotherapy and the one-year followup revealed no evidence of tumor.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Twenty-one-year-old female.

Discussion\n\n【15】The diagnosis of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor is very rare and usually involves several different diagnostic techniques. The most challenging part is the differential diagnosis which is broad with morphological and immunohistochemical overlapping features between the entities. Therefore, mostly frequently molecular biology techniques need to be applied for a definitive diagnosis. We reported 2 cases of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor with an unusual clinical presentation which were incidentally found during imaging. These cases illustrated very well the difficulties with which general pathologists are faced in the routine anatomical pathology examination when faced with renal poorly differentiated neoplasm in adults.\n\n【16】Both cases had an uncanny presentation. In case number 1, the 8.3 cm kidney mass was discovered after the patient presented clinically with irradiating flank pain, mimicking the pain related with kidney stones. Moreover, it was associated with a benign ovarian tumor and the diagnosis of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING was only possible after extensive immunohistochemical and molecular studies, which were mainly performed to rule out other entities that were considered due to the unusual presentation and associated ovarian tumor. In literature-reported renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING, the clinical presentation was often nonspecific, comprising abdominal pain, palpable mass, and hematuria, and most reported cases were diagnosed incidentally by image studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–8\\]</u>. Few tumors had associated concurrent abnormalities such as hemangioma, central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and ovarian disgerminoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Our second case report was even more unusual. The Case 2 presented with respiratory problems after being involved in an automobilistic accident where multiple fractures were acquired. The clinical presentation suggested pulmonary thormboembolism, which was confirmed by image; however, after histopathological examination of the thrombectomy material small blue cell tumor of uncertain origin was regarded as the cause for the extensive thromboembolic event. Later on, a nephrectomy was performed and a renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING was diagnosed. As far as literature reports, there are few reports of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING with tumor thrombus extending to the inferior vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. However, in our case the thrombus extended all the way up to the inferior vena cava, right atrium, and bilateral pulmonary arteries, with more aggressive tumor extension than the previous reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】As far as disease progression, our cases had a better response to chemotherapy and surgery than the previous reported cases of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The outcome of other patients reported in the literature included very short survival, nonresponse to intensive therapy, and death 5 months after diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–8, 11\\]</u>. Both our cases were free of disease after one year, and long-term outcome is still awaited.\n\n【19】Renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor should be differentiated from other small blue cell tumors arising in the kidney such as blastemal predominant Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, desmoplastic small blue cell tumor, and synovial sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 12\\]</u>. All of them have very similar morphology with frequent overlapping morphological features, thus, extensive immunohistochemistry panel, in addition to the morphological features, is essential in reaching the final diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【20】CD99 was the former marker for Ewings’ sarcoma; however, it is also expressed in other tumors such as synovial sarcoma, Wilms’ tumor, vascular malignancy, neuroendocrine tumors, and lymphoblastic lymphoma, and therefore nowadays is not considered a reliable marker of tumor origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 8\\]</u>. Our presented first case showed a very weak stain for CD99, and the second one because of the bloody background was very difficult to interpret illustrating some of the difficulties in using this marker in diagnostic grounds.\n\n【21】From the neuroendocrine marker, CD56 was positive in both cases whereas synapthophysin was positive only in the second case in a cytoplasm dot pattern. This pattern has been considered as an unspecific pattern, but a recent publication described the pattern in oligodendrogliomas, and therefore the pattern seems to indicate neural origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The features favoring the diagnosis of blastemal Wilms tumor are young age and positivity of blastemal elements for vimentin, low molecular weight cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and WT1. Both cases in our study were positive for cytokeratin and vimentin. However, WT1 was negative and EWSR1 gene was identified by FISH, and therefore adult Wilms’ tumor was ruled out.\n\n【23】Renal neuroblastomas are also similar morphologically to renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor. However, they usually occur at the age of 5 years and show a fibrillary background or a ganglionic differentiation facilitating the diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry is very useful to differentiate it from renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor because neuroblastomas are consistently positive for NSE and chromogranin and mostly negative for CD99.\n\n【24】Rhabdomyosarcoma is often positive for smooth muscle actin, desmin, and myogenin; all of them were negative in our patients. Desmoplastic small blue cell tumors are also positive for desmin, and synovial sarcoma was ruled out using the FISH for the X-18 SYT translocation, which was negative.\n\n【25】Finally, lymphoblastic lymphoma could be excluded by performing analysis with LCA and other hematopoietic markers; however, in the second case the background was positive for lymphoid markers. The differential was performed by morphology of the tumor cells which had stippled chromatin and pleomorphism whereas the lymphoid cells formed a uniform monotonous population with small dark nuclei in the background.\n\n【26】In our cases, the molecular analysis identifying the translocation was a supportive and strong confirmatory tool, especially with the confusing immunohistochemical profile. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using the 22q12 LSI, EWSR1, and Dual-Color Break-Apart Probe showed the translocation pattern 22q12 for the EWSR1 gene. The probe used in our cases is from Vysis (Abbott Laboratories, Downers Grove, Ill, USA) and is commercially available, and data have been published using this probe. The probe is an EWSR1 (22; q12) Dual-Color, Break-Apart Rearrangement Probe, which consists of a mixture of 2 FISH DNA probes. The first is a 500 kb probe labeled in spectrum orange and flanks the 5 V side of EWSR1 gene and extends inward into intron 4. The second probe is 1100 kb labeled in spectrum green and flanks the 3 V side of the EWSR1 gene. There is 7-kb probe between the 2 probes. The known breakpoints within the EWSR1 gene are restricted to introns 7 through 10V. Approximately 90% of the translocations involving EWSR1 gene result in t(11; 22) translocation characteristic of EWS/PNET.\n\n【27】Because most renal primitive neuroectodermal tumors/EWING tumor of the kidney are poorly differentiated and have a broad morphological spectrum, it is important to have genetic confirmation for the presence of t(11; 22) for the accurate identification of these tumors, and the FISH probe is a good and easy method to do so.\n\n【28】In summary, we report two cases of primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor arising in the kidney confirmed by morphology, immunohistochemistry and FISH. The unusual presentation in our cases delayed the diagnosis, being both tumors diagnosed incidentally. Thus, we believe that these cases added some features to the already broad spectrum of presentations described in renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor and also showed the importance of molecular analysis together with morphological and immunohistochemical features for confirmation of this poorly differentiated neoplasm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:51", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:01:07", "cost": 16.284}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:01:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:51"}

The exact mechanism of GH remains unknown, but fluctuations in blood glucose and insulin levels play important roles in promoting glycogen accumulation. We report a case of a 16-year-old female diagnosed with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus with hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes. The patient experienced multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis, and she also had celiac disease diagnosed 2 years previously based on serology and a duodenal biopsy. The laboratory analyses results were compatible with acute hepatitis, and the celiac serology was positive. Other investigations ruled out viral hepatitis and autoimmune and metabolic liver diseases. Ultrasound and computerized tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen revealed liver enlargement with diffuse fatty infiltration. A liver biopsy revealed the presence of abundant glycogen in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes. PAS staining was strongly positive, which confirmed the diagnosis of GH. There were no features of autoimmune hepatitis or significant fibrosis. Duodenal biopsy results were consistent with celiac disease. Despite our efforts, which are supported by a multidisciplinary team approach that included a hepatologist, a diabetic educator, a dietitian, and an endocrinologist, we have encountered difficulties in controlling the patient’s diabetes, and she persistently maintains symptomatic hepatomegaly and abnormal liver biochemistry. Given the patient’s age, we assumed that these abnormalities were related to patient noncompliance. In conclusion, GH remains an under-recognized complication of type 1 DM that is potentially reversible with adequate glycemic control. The awareness of GH should prevent diagnostic delay and its implications for management and the outcome.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Glycogen hepatopathy is characterized by glycogen deposition in hepatocytes due to both glycogen synthesis and the inhibition of glycogenolysis. This condition has been described in type 1 diabetes mellitus and occurs as a result of an imbalance in the production and degradation of glycogen following insulin introduction. This imbalance leads to the abnormal accumulation of glycogen in hepatocytes and results in hepatomegaly and the leakage of transaminases out of liver cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.

She was referred to an adult hepatology outpatient clinic due to hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes that were discovered incidentally during a routine workup a year previously.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 16-year-old female was referred to an adult hepatology outpatient clinic due to elevated liver enzymes that were discovered incidentally during a routine workup one year previously. She had T1DM diagnosed 4 years previously and was receiving insulin therapy with an average requirement of 1.2 units/kg/day. However, her diabetes was poorly controlled (hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> 11.5%), and she had multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n【7】She was frequently nauseated and frequently complained of abdominal distension associated with mild to moderate colicky intermittent epigastric pain. There was no history of liver disease, blood transfusion, herbal ingestion, or cholelithiasis. She was not an alcohol or drug consumer and was not taking any medication other than insulin. Additionally, she did not exhibit any symptom or signs compatible with acute or chronic hepatitis. The patient had celiac disease diagnosed 2 years previously based on serology and a duodenal biopsy. She was on a strict gluten-free diet. Her elder brother had T1DM, and her younger brother had eczema. There was no family history of liver diseases or other autoimmune disorders. Her menarche occurred at 12 years of age, and her periods were irregular.\n\n【8】Physical examination revealed a body mass index of 22.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. She had a nontender distended and tense abdomen with hepatomegaly. She had no ascites or stigmata of chronic liver disease. Her pubertal development was normal. The physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【9】During her clinical follow-ups, she had several severe flares of serum transaminases that returned to normal within days without any specific treatment. Her laboratory analyses were compatible with acute hepatitis  with concomitant increases in gamma-glutamyl transferase (164 U/L, normal <55) and alkaline phosphatase (286 U/L, normal <180). Her liver function panels were all normal and included albumin (39 g/L), INR (0.81), and total bilirubin (4 µmol/L). Her lipid profile was abnormal with elevated triglycerides (5.26 mmol/L) and a cholesterol level of 7.2 mmol/L.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Liver enzymes pattern.</u>\n\n【11】A complete blood cell count, renal profile, and ferritin level were normal. The serologies for viral hepatitis A, B, C, E, HIV, EBV, and cytomegalovirus were negative. A complete workup for autoimmune and metabolic liver disease was unremarkable and included tests for serum ceruloplasmin, copper, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha-fetoprotein, and immunoglobulins. Additionally, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-nuclear smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), and liver-kidney microsomal antibody (LKM1) were all negative. The celiac serology was positive. Her thyroid function, FSH, LSH, and prolactin levels were normal. Her vitamin D level was low (58.29 nmol/l normal >145), and her vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal.\n\n【12】The ultrasound and CT scans of the abdomen revealed liver enlargement (23 cm span) with a bright, coarse echotexture. She exhibited no splenomegaly or ascites. A liver biopsy revealed the presence of abundant glycogen in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes. The PAS staining was strongly positive. Perls staining revealed no iron deposition. There were no features of autoimmune hepatitis or significant fibrosis . A duodenal biopsy revealed total villous atrophy with an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes and crypt hyperplasia consistent with celiac disease.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Liver biopsy showing presence of abundant glycogen in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and (b) a strongly positive PAS stain.</u>\n\n【14】Despite our efforts, which were supported by a multidisciplinary team approach that included a hepatologist, diabetic educator, dietitian, and endocrinologist, we have encountered difficulties in controlling the patient’s diabetes, and she is persistently symptomatic with hepatomegaly and abnormal liver biochemistry. Given the patient’s age, we initially assumed that these abnormalities were related to patient noncompliance.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】From a historical point of view, in 1930, Pierre Mauriac described Mauriac Syndrome (MS) as a rare complication of poorly controlled type I DM in children. MS is characterized by overloading of the hepatocytes with glycogen, hepatomegaly, and abnormal liver enzymes. MS is associated with growth failure, delayed puberty, and cushingoid features. These complications were first described shortly after the introduction of insulin in 1922 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Hepatic glycogen deposition was described as a feature of MS, but more recently it has been described in the absence of other MS features. Even more recently, this condition has been known as glycogenic hepatopathy (GH) and has been described in children, adolescents, and young adult with poorly controlled type I DM. MS has recently been reported in patients with type II DM who are receiving insulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The disease results from glycogen synthesis and the inhibition of glycogenolysis. In the state of hyperglycemia, glucose enters hepatocytes independent of insulin and is subsequently converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by glucokinase. This high level of G-6-P can allosterically stimulate glycogen synthesis via the activation of glycogen synthase. When insulin is administered, it has a covalent modification effect on both glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis that involves the promotion of the dephosphorylation of both the glycogen phosphatase and glycogen synthase enzymes. This effect leads to an imbalance in the production and degradation of glycogen, and the hepatocytes subsequently abnormally accumulate glycogen. Swelling of the hepatocytes leads to the leakage of liver transaminases and hepatomegaly. This condition can occur as early as two to four weeks after the initiation of insulin therapy or as a late complication of poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. However, not all diabetic patients who exhibit poor glycemic control develop GH. It has been suggested that a regulatory protein is responsible for the marked glycogen accumulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>; however, recent studies have failed to demonstrate such an effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Although the mechanism of the development of GH is still unrecognized, it is clear that fluctuations in blood glucose and insulin levels play an important role in the promotion of glycogen accumulation. This process can be controlled by either stabilizing the persistent hyperglycemia with infrequent large doses of insulin, such as those given during ketoacidosis, or alternately by the administration of glucose to patients who are receiving excessive insulin to treat the hypoglycemic episodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Several studies have demonstrated that intensive glycemic control or the normalization of glucose metabolism in post-pancreatic transplantation leads to the normalization of liver enzymes and resolves hepatomegaly. Additionally, the complete resolution of histopathological changes can occur within a relatively short period, which results in a favorable prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Hepatomegaly and elevated serum transaminase in diabetic patients are commonly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Clinically, it is important to distinguish GH from NAFLD. The characteristics of both diseases are summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4, 9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Comparison of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and glycogenic hepatopathy.</u>\n\n【23】In our case, prior to obtaining the liver biopsy, we thought of celiac hepatopathy as a possible explanation for her unexplained elevated liver enzymes given her positive serology and abnormal duodenal biopsy. Our case is one of the two reported cases of GH in association with celiac disease. Celiac hepatopathy clinically, radiologically, and histologically varies depending on the degree of liver injury. The characteristics of celiac hepatopathy are summarized in Table 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Comparison of celiac hepatopathy and glycogenic hepatopathy.</u>\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】GH remains an under-recognized complication of type 1DM and is characterized by severe transaminase flares and hepatomegaly and is reversible with adequate glycemic control.

The management and treatment of these cases can become challenging, since it also can present with atypical or even no symptoms in physical evaluation. A 14-year-old boy was referred to our hospital with a history of insertion of a paintbrush into his anus four weeks before the admission. The paintbrush had perforated the colon and was in the abdominopelvic cavity; however, no symptoms of peritonitis were observed. Rectal examination, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy were unremarkable. Exploratory laparoscopy was performed, and the paintbrush was taken out completely. The patient was discharged in good condition. In cases with rectal foreign body insertion, perforation without causing peritonitis or acute abdomen is possible. In these conditions, imaging examinations play an essential role in managing the patients, and laparoscopy can be a proper procedure for retrieving the foreign body.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Management and treatment of rectal foreign body (FB) insertion are among challenging conditions due to the variety of objects with different shapes and, as a result, different trauma patterns to the rectum and colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the examination, our purpose is to obtain information about the FB’s size, shape, number, and location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Also, in cases with perforation, peritonitis should be diagnosed early 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>; however, perforation can be presented without any peritoneal symptoms in some patients. Unlike adults, rectal FB insertion in pediatrics is rare and infrequently reported. Herein, we intend to report a 14-year-old boy with a paintbrush inserted into his rectum without any noticeable symptoms in physical evaluation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Chief Complaint and Admission\n\n【6】A 14-year-old boy had been visited by a doctor due to the rectal insertion of a paintbrush, in which computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was performed and demonstrated a 90 × 6 mm shaped object in the abdominopelvic cavity. He was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.\n\n【7】##### 2.2. History Taking and Examinations\n\n【8】He reported a history of rectal insertion of a paintbrush four weeks ago, which resulted in rectorrhagia and pain during defecation since that time. The 4-week delay in seeking medical care was because of the patient’s mortification. In physical examination, no fever, abdominal tenderness, or rebound was observed. In his CT image, the paintbrush was in the abdominopelvic cavity, located in the middle part of the lower abdomen. Oblique orientation of the FB was seen with the left tip pointing to the left lower abdomen and the right tip to the posterior of the lower abdomen, just anterior to sigmoid bowel loops. The location of the FB was reported in the mesenteric area with adjacent fat stranding and not in the bowel loops . However, the rectal examination was unremarkable. We performed another CT scan for reassurance and reevaluation, which had the same result in comparison to the first image. He underwent rigid sigmoidoscopy under general anesthesia, with no findings in the last 25 cm of the rectum and sigmoid colon. Subsequently, a colonoscopy was performed, which did not show any abnormality. Eventually, exploratory laparoscopy was performed.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Computed tomography imaging of a 14-year-old boy with evidence of a foreign body (paintbrush) in the pelvic cavity, anterior to sigmoid bowel loops (marked with blue outline).</u>\n\n【10】##### 2.3. Surgical Procedure\n\n【11】The patient was taken to the operating room for general anesthesia and was placed in the supine position. Insufflation was done via the insertion of a Veress needle into the umbilicus. Then, a trocar was passed from the umbilicus for the laparoscope, and two laparoscopic graspers were passed from the abdominal wall, one in the right lower quadrant and the other in the left lower quadrant. The peritoneal cavity was explored, and the tip of the paintbrush was found. The paintbrush was covered with omentum, so dissection of the omentum was performed, and the paintbrush was taken entirely out by laparoscopic graspers . No other abnormal finding or intestinal damage was observed in the peritoneal cavity. Finally, the fascia and skin were closed layer by layer.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Laparoscopy view demonstrating foreign body (paintbrush) in the omentum.</u>\n\n【13】##### 2.4. Postoperation and Follow-Up\n\n【14】The patient received ceftriaxone (25 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours for two days) and metronidazole (10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for two days) postoperatively and was discharged in good condition three days after the surgery. The patient has been visited routinely at our clinic postoperatively, with no signs and symptoms presented. After three years from the operation, he is well without any complaints.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】The trend of rectal FB insertion is increasing based on studies from western countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The majority cause of rectal FB insertion is self-/partner-eroticism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Also, it should be noted that criminal assault and psychiatric disorders are two other main reasons for FB insertion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In many rectal FB patients, seeking the medical center may be delayed because of the patients’ embarrassment, as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Rectal FB insertion in pediatrics is not as common as that in adults, and fewer studies have been published in this manner. In the present study, we reported a 14-year-old boy with rectal FB insertion retrieved with laparoscopy.\n\n【17】There were two points in our case, which were interesting to be mentioned: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the paintbrush had perforated the colon; however, the site of perforation healed, and there was no evidence of any injury in sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Although the paintbrush entered into the peritoneal cavity, there were no symptoms of acute abdomen or peritonitis.\n\n【18】Few studies of pediatric rectal FB insertion are reported in the literature.

Besides, a study by Fischer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> reported 27,755 cases, aged 0 to 25 years, with FB injury involving the rectum, vagina, and penis, based on the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System of the United States. The study was performed between 2008 and 2017. In the mentioned study, 51.93% of the cases were from 0 to 18 years that 46.90% of them had rectal involvement. Also, the annual trend of rectal FBs was increasing.\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Review of literature regarding rectal foreign bodies in pediatrics.</u>\n\n【20】A detailed history and physical examination are crucial in the first step 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.

In the presence of peritonitis, a perforation is possible, which requires an urgent laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Rectal examination should be performed as a part of the physical examination to palpate the FB and determine the competency of the anal sphincter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Due to the possibility of inserting a hazardous object (e.g. shattered glass), a detailed history of the item inserted is essential for rectal examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Some studies suggest the rectal examination to be performed after radiographical evaluation to prevent physicians’ injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Lack of specific symptoms makes the diagnosis and treatment approach more challenging, especially when the patients do not report a detailed history.\n\n【21】Imaging is essential for retained FBs. Although radiography is suggested to be the first diagnostic approach, CT imaging can give more information, especially in the presence of peritoneal symptoms or in higher FBs. Typically, colorectal FBs with perforation can be diagnosed with wall disruption of the bowel and the FB position in the image; however, free gas is not commonly seen. Besides, colovesical fistula or inflammatory mass can be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【22】There are various therapeutic approaches, including transanal extraction, endoscopic technique, and surgical procedure, for retained FBs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. FB should be retrieved with the least possible invasive procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Transanal extraction, which is performed with local anesthesia, is successful in 60% to 75% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. If transanal extraction was unsuccessful, an endoscopic approach via rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopy is convenient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The next option is surgery, which can be less invasive with laparoscopy, as in our case, or laparotomy, as the last option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Also, as mentioned, peritonitis shows the possibility of perforation and should be managed with an urgent laparotomy.\n\n【23】There are few reports regarding the management of pediatric rectal FBs in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. We propose our simplified management algorithm for rectal FBs . Based on our algorithm, FBs in the gastrointestinal tract cannot be accessed from the abdomen, so transanal extraction/sigmoidoscopy is preferred. However, FBs located in the abdominopelvic cavity are more complicated. According to our approach, when the patient does not present with symptoms of the acute abdomen but has some other symptoms, such as localized tenderness, laparoscopy or laparotomy is suggested after resuscitation. However, in the presence of the symptoms of peritonitis, laparotomy is our choice. In an asymptomatic clinical situation, both laparoscopy and laparotomy can be done. It is worth mentioning that our report addresses FBs that the child has acknowledged the entry of an object into the anus and are so large that they cannot be managed by observation and follow-up, and incidental findings are not included in our report. In our case, we performed laparoscopy because of three reasons: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the FB was in the abdominopelvic cavity, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the site of perforation healed with no evidence of any injury in the sigmoidoscopy, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the advantages of laparoscopic surgery over open surgery. In an alternative situation, if partial part of the FB had been seen in the sigmoidoscopy, or the rectum wall had not healed, laparotomy would have been our choice.\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 A simplified management algorithm for rectal foreign bodies; FB, foreign body.</u>\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】In conclusion, our case demonstrated that perforation of the colon and retained FB in the peritoneal cavity may present without acute abdomen or peritoneal symptoms. In these cases, imaging, especially CT scan, can play an essential role in diagnosis and appropriate approach; also, it can be useful for ruling out other conditions. Laparoscopy can be a proper approach in such cases.

Whilst the underlying cause in this case was unusual it emphasizes the importance of considering secondary causes which may not have an autoimmune aetiology.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 59-year-old was referred to the rheumatology clinic for investigation of possible vasculitis. She had a two-week history of pain and discolouration of her left second and third toes preceded by six months of Raynaud’s phenomenon affecting her fingers and toes. She experienced several attacks of Raynaud’s each day often triggered by cold. She was otherwise well with no symptoms to suggest an underlying connective tissue disease and no past medical history of note. She had recently stopped smoking, having previously smoked 20 cigarettes daily for more than 20 years.\n\n【6】On examination she was apyrexial with ischaemic lesions on 2nd and 3rd toes . Peripheral pulses were normal and systemic examination was unremarkable. Urinalysis was negative.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Left foot of a 59-year-old patient presenting to rheumatology clinic.</u>\n\n【8】Investigations revealed haemoglobin of 146 g/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(115–165)</u>, platelet count of 786 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(150–400)</u>, and white cells of 16 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(4–11)</u>. White cell differential showed a lymphocyte count of 3.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (1.5–4.5), neutrophil count of 10.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (1.7–7.5), monocytes of 1.2 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (0.2–0.8), eosinophils of 0.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (0–0.4), and basophils of 0.2 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (0–0.1). Liver, renal, and thyroid functions were normal as were CRP, immunoglobulins, complement levels, and Doppler imaging of the lower limbs. ANA, ANCA, and rheumatoid factors were negative.\n\n【9】In view of the thrombocytosis, a JAK2 mutation assay was performed. This confirmed a JAK2 V617F mutation suggesting essential thrombocytosis (ET) as the cause.\n\n【10】Initially treatment was directed at improving peripheral blood flow and pain control. This included oral nifedipine, aspirin, and intravenous iloprost. Opiates were required for pain relief. Despite these measures the toe failed to improve and the Raynaud’s symptoms continued.\n\n【11】Following the diagnosis of ET treatment with hydroxycarbamide was commenced. Treatment with hydroxycarbamide normalised the platelet count within three months and led to complete resolution of the Raynaud’s symptoms and healing of the ischaemic lesions.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】ET is an uncommon myeloproliferative disease with an estimated incidence of 0.4–2.5 per 100,000 per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

The platelet count is often elevated above 1000 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L although studies suggest a median level of around 800 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Lower levels are not unusual and may be attributed to inflammation or tissue necrosis.\n\n【15】Our patient presented with the triphasic white, blue, and red colour change of Raynaud’s and features of digital ischaemia.

The study evaluated these five subjects using clinical, laboratory, electrophysiological, and genetic testing. The findings showed that clinical features demonstrated no pes cavus, no significant weakness in the hands or feet, normal reflexes in four out of the five subjects, and mild to normal electrodiagnostic findings. The variant was associated with painful and numb feet with diminished sensation to pinprick. This study suggests that GDAP1 variants may be associated with very mild, predominantly sensory Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, warranting continuing research for this type of the disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) reflects a group of inherited neuropathies affecting 1 in 2,500 individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. CMT type 1A is the most common CMT, accounting for approximately 60% of those with a genetic diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Classically, CMT is characterized by distal weakness, foot structural deformities, sensory abnormalities, areflexia, and abnormalities in gait 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Genetic advances have allowed the classic CMT phenotype to be expanded and evaluated for idiopathic unexplained neuropathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The rare forms of CMT still need to be understood. This study aims to elucidate our understanding of the clinical features of heterozygous GDAP1 mutations.\n\n【5】GDAP1 mutations can present in both heterozygous and homozygous forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. GDAP1 mutations are responsible for demyelinating intermediate and axonal recessive CMT and CMT 2K, a rare dominant axonal CMT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7–10\\]</u>. The majority of GDAP1 mutations are biallelic giving rise to autosomal recessive CMT, which can present as either demyelinating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, axonal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, or intermediate CMT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Although the homozygous presentation is typically very severe with early childhood onset with motor and sensory involvement and possible vocal fold paresis, the heterozygous form seems much less severe with a late-onset mild sensory presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【7】This study further describes the clinical presentation of GDAP1 mutations and adds to the knowledge of heterozygous GDAP1 mutations.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Methods\n\n【9】All subjects received care at the AdventHealth Orlando Neuroscience Institute. All had neurological records evaluated. In addition, four out of the five individuals had electrodiagnostic testing performed. Genetic testing for inherited neuropathies was performed through Invitae (San Francisco, CA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Three pathogenic variants in the GDAP1 gene were identified, and one variant of uncertain significance in the GDAP1 gene was also detected.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【11】Case 1. As a child, this subject had no difficulties with running, walking, roller skating, or biking. She was not athletic and was the slowest runner compared to her peers at school but was healthy and active. Her symptoms first started in her 50s when she started to have difficulty with fatigue and numbness in her toes. Occasionally, she will have pain. She has no weakness but does have some difficulty with climbing stairs. Her son was diagnosed with CMT at age 10 due to high arches, which prompted her evaluation for CMT.\n\n【12】Case 2. In her youth, she had no difficulties with running, walking, balance, or athletics. She was a slow runner in general and had weak ankles. Her symptoms started in her 20s when she experienced burning foot pain after standing for prolonged periods. In her 40s, she felt that she started to develop numbness in her feet and mild difficulty with dexterity in her hands. Examination revealed absent Achilles reflexes.\n\n【13】Case 3. As a child, she had no difficulties with running, walking, roller skating, or biking. Although she was not athletic, she was a fast walker. She had some mild tremors throughout her life. She developed burning, tingling, and extreme sensitivity to cold at age 67. She has numbness in her thumbs and paresthesias in her hands and feet. Neurological examination is intact except for absent Achilles reflexes. Both her father and her daughter have CMT 2K.\n\n【14】Case 4. Daughter of the Case 3 proband: as a child, she was athletic and the fastest runner compared to her peers in school. She had cramps and growing pains but no other symptoms; she has normal foot structure. Then, in her 40s, she developed numbness in her left toes and obtained genetic testing due to her mother’s CMT diagnosis.\n\n【15】Case 5. As a child, he was athletic. In his early 50s, he started to develop constant daily pain in both plantar aspects of his feet below the middle toe area. He also has a numb feeling as if someone wrapped duct tape around his foot. Despite pain relieving interventions, including neurontin, pregabalin, marijuana, and acupuncture, he has not had pain relief. He has difficulty walking due to his balance. He had a ruptured Achilles tendon. He walks and rides his bike daily. EMG/NCS showed minor abnormalities to suggest a possible sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Exam is significant only for absent ankle jerk reflexes and pinprick sensation decreased up to ankle.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【17】CMT can have various symptoms and signs, including mild paresthesias, as evidenced in this study. In some cases, genetic testing can reveal underlying causes of idiopathic mild neuropathies.\n\n【18】The findings from the subjects with a heterozygous pathogenic GDAP1 missense variant  demonstrate that all presented with a mild sensory neuropathy; all except one subject had a late-onset neuropathy developing after age 40. Electrodiagnostic testing was normal in one of the five individuals, with the other two individuals having minor nerve conduction abnormalities. Neurological exam was normal except for decreased pinprick in proband 1, absent reflexes in proband 2, and absent Achilles reflex in proband 3. There was no family history in proband 2. Proband 1 had a son with high arches in his feet at age 10. Proband 3 has a daughter with numbness in her left toe and a father who had a neuropathy. Proband 5 developed pain in his feet in his 50s.\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Clinical Results of individuals with a heterozygous GDAP1 missense variant.</u>\n\n【20】Previous studies of heterozygous GDAP1 variants suggest a late-onset, slowly progressive, and mild neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9\\]</u>. Another earlier study suggested a wide variability in age of onset and severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Zimon et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u> also reported heterozygous GDAP1 variants with various age onset, but unlike our study, some subjects presented with walking difficulties. However, similar to our study, some subjects were asymptomatic, perhaps due to incomplete penetrance or the nature of the heterozygous form. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed an axonal or an intermediate pattern. A previous study suggested that five variants in the GDAP1 gene (p.Arg120Gly, p.Arg120Trp, p.His123Arg, p.Gln218Glu, and p.Arg226Ser) had a milder and indolent clinical course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In general, heterozygous carriers were milder.\n\n【21】The GDAP1 variant is a rare CMT variant in which autosomal recessive and dominant forms can be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Multiple organs may be affected, including the nasal mucosa, skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. The following case highlights a unique manifestation of HHT in a patient with a gastrointestinal hemorrhage and epistaxis, resulting in hyperammonemia and diffuse cerebral edema and herniation. Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication in such patients and initiate ammonia-reducing agents early to avoid this devastating consequence.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), eponymously known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by widespread angiogenesis. HHT has a wide geographic and ethnic distribution. In North America and Europe, the prevalence is estimated to be 1:10,000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In geographically isolated populations, the prevalence of HHT is higher, such as an estimated 1:5000 in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and 1:1330 in the Afro-Caribbean islands of Curaçao and Bonaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, the true prevalence is likely underestimated, given its broad array of phenotypic presentations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】HHT is a clinical diagnosis, which has been codified by the Curaçao Criteria  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The presence of recurrent epistaxis is the most sensitive clinical manifestation of HHT, with average onset of epistaxis at 12 years and nearly 100% of patients affected by age 40. However, visceral lesions, which are the greatest contributor to HHT mortality, are often undetected and asymptomatic. The mortality rate increases with age, with the cumulative death rate at age 50 estimated to be 14% in one study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Thus, early HHT detection, screening, and intervention are essential for improving patient outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. HHT can be diagnosed by looking for specific genotypic mutations. Over 97% of patients with HHT possess mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4, which modulate TGF-β signaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. However, diagnosis is not contingent on the presence of these mutations.\n\n【5】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Curaçao Criteria for clinical diagnosis of HHT.</u>\n\n【6】HHT’s most life-threatening manifestations arise in the form of visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which may result in high-output heart failure, portal hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic dysfunction are relatively common, and cohort imaging studies have shown that over two-thirds of patients with HHT possess hepatic AVMs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Hepatic AVMs in HHT rarely lead to hyperammonemia and resultant hepatic encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–19\\]</u>. This case illustrates the presentation of the first reported occurrence of subsequent transtentorial herniation as well as management strategies.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【8】A 64-year-old female with HHT presented to the hospital with a 24-hour history of nonbloody diarrhea and new onset hematemesis. Her HHT was diagnosed 40 years prior and had been complicated by refractory epistaxis, recurrent gastric bleeding from gastric ulcers and AVMs, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and hepatic AVMs resulting in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. She had been treated with steroids, danazol, doxycycline, aminocaproic acid, and bevacizumab and had undergone septodermoplasty and posterior nosebleed cauterizations. Most recently, she was receiving thalidomide 50 mg nightly with clinical improvement. She was also prescribed lactulose for her history of hepatic encephalopathy and iron supplementation. She had never smoked and did not drink alcohol.\n\n【9】On arrival to the emergency department, she had large volume hematemesis. She was hypotensive and tachycardic. On examination, she was lethargic but arousable. Her skin and conjunctiva were pale, and she had abdominal distension with generalized tenderness to palpation, along with melena and hematochezia on rectal exam. Her labs on admission were notable for a hemoglobin of 5.0 g/dL, platelet count of 103 k/µL, prothrombin time of 15.4 seconds, fibrinogen of 149 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 38 mg/dL. She had an ammonia level of 120 mmol/L. A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed, and the patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection and transferred to the intensive care unit where she received numerous transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBC), platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and cryoprecipitate. In addition, infusions of pantoprazole, octreotide, norepinephrine, and normal saline were given. Emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed at bedside showed a large volume of blood at the lower third of the esophagus and stomach, along with a few nonbleeding cratered gastric ulcers . Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, demonstrating extensive arteriovenous (AV) shunting from underlying vascular malformations in the liver, though there was no localizable source of bleeding .\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Endoscopy images showing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Although 3% hypertonic saline was started, serial CT scans demonstrated progressive worsening of the cerebral edema with impending transtentorial herniation .\n\n【17】Because her ammonia levels did not improve with pharmacologic management, she was started on renal replacement therapy (RRT) for the sole purpose of ammonia clearance, though this proved to have limited success. Eventually, a combination therapy of sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate, and L-arginine dropped her serum ammonia levels to a nadir of 31 µmol/L . Ornithine and phenylalanine amino acid levels were within reference ranges, ruling out an inborn disorder of the urea cycle.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Trend of ammonia level over the course of this patient’s hospital admission.

While her ammonia normalized and serial imaging showed improvement in the cerebral edema, she remained in a persistent vegetative state and was ultimately transitioned to hospice.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】This case highlights the significant neurologic sequelae of uncontrolled gastric hemorrhage in an HHT patient with hepatic AVMs. The majority of HHT cases with hepatic involvement are asymptomatic, although some individuals can develop high-output cardiac failure, biliary ischemia, or portal hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. There are reports published in the literature of patients with HHT and hepatic AVMs who develop portosystemic shunting, hyperammonemia, and subsequent encephalopathy. However, the patients in these cases responded to treatment with lactulose, without reaching the level of acute decompensation and cerebral herniation seen in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 21\\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hyperammonemia-induced transtentorial herniation occurring in HHT.\n\n【22】When blood is digested following gastrointestinal hemorrhage, globin breakdown results in a rise in circulating amino acids and ammonia which are subsequently converted to urea by hepatocytes in the liver via the urea cycle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. However, for patients with impaired hepatic function, the liver is unable to efficiently convert ammonia to urea, which results in a toxic accumulation of ammonia. Ammonia is able to cross the blood-brain barrier where it is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase within cerebral astrocytes. Glutamine accumulation within astrocytes leads to increased osmotic pressure and cerebral edema, putting patients at risk for elevated intracranial pressure and cerebral herniation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Portosystemic encephalopathy due to hyperammonemia is rarely reported in HHT and has been attributed to the presence of hepatic AVMs. There are three categories of hepatic shunting that occur in patients with HHT, including those between the hepatic artery and hepatic vein; hepatic artery and portal vein; and the portal vein and hepatic vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Shunting between the portal vein and hepatic vein is the mechanism by which hepatic encephalopathy is thought to occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In patients with refractory GI bleeding and hepatic AVMs or cirrhosis, determining the optimum therapy to reduce a toxic accumulation of ammonia is paramount in reducing patient morbidity and mortality. Though there are no guidelines for RRT use in hyperammonemia, it appears to be a plausible treatment option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. However, as this case demonstrated, it may not always be efficacious. Another option is to facilitate removal of ammonia via the urea cycle. L-Arginine acts to increase the activity of N\\-acetylglutamate synthetase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-1, key enzymes within the urea cycle, by increasing the availability of L-citrulline and lessening hyperammonemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Sodium benzoate/sodium phenylacetate is a combination medication used in hyperammonemia. Its mechanism involves the conjugation of benzoate with glycine and phenylacetate with glutamine to yield hippuric acid and phenylacetylglutamine, respectively. Because glycine and glutamine contain nitrogen from ammonia, by combining these substances with benzoate and phenylacetate, their end-products can be renally excreted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26, 27\\]</u>. These treatments substantially reduce ammonia levels.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】This case uniquely demonstrates a neurologic catastrophe that may occur in patients with HHT who have hepatic AVMs and GI bleeding but also suggests potential treatment strategies that should be initiated early. Patients with hepatic AVMs may have a predisposition to encephalopathy after experiencing bleeding events, including GI bleeds and epistaxis. As this case illustrates, cerebral herniation can occur regardless of expedient management, but early treatment with amino acid therapy, RRT, rifaximin, and rectal lactulose should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:27:57", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:34:23", "cost": 385.278}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:34:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:27:57"}

The latest coronavirus infection due to SARS-CoV-2, which started in China in December 2019, was announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. All epidemiological data so far show us that SARS-CoV-2 infection is less serious in children than in adults. Allergic asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, is usually not to be related to greater risk or severity for COVID-19 in pediatric populations. Although reports/research on asthma and COVID-19 in children have thus far been comforting, when coming across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case Report. Here, we report a rare adolescent case of COVID-19-related pneumonia development with underlying asthma. A 16-year-old male patient has been followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of asthma for the last 5 years. He was thought to have typical clinical and laboratory findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with underlying pediatric (allergic) asthma. Pulmonary CT showed findings consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia. He was discharged after 1 week when all his complaints regressed, his examination became normal, and 5-day favipiravir treatment was completed. Conclusion. When a physician comes across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus pandemic, owing to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was later announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is the third highest known pathogen coronavirus, whose mortality rates range from 6 to 10.5%, depending on the comorbidity of the infected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. At least, a quarter of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are reported to have one of the chronic diseases as a comorbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Some of the comorbidities, especially chronic respiratory tract diseases (such as asthma and COPD) with long-standing drug treatments, may influence the development, therapy, and prognosis of COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Here, a rarely seen case of a 16-year-old adolescent male patient is discussed under the light of the current literature, since he developed severe COVID-19-related pneumonia with the preexisting diagnosis of asthma.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 16-year-old male patient has been followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of asthma for the last 5 years. The patient was regularly using daily montelukast 10 mg tablet and budesonide + formoterol 80/4.5 mcg 2x1 puffs in the maintenance treatment of asthma. His persistent asthma has been under control, and its severity is mild. His pulmonary function test (spirometry) was found to be within normal limits (predicted FEV1: 131%, FVC: 136%, FEV1/FVC: 92, and PEF: 90%) several times for the last 3 years. He was detected to be allergic to molds and wild grasses. A skin prick test showed indurations as negative control: 0 × 0 mm, positive control: 6 × 6 mm, Chenopodium album: 3 × 3 mm, and Cladosporium: 3 × 3 mm.\n\n【7】He had symptoms of persisting fever up to 39°C degrees in the morning and night for 5 days and cough with green sputum and described a very severe headache for 3-4 days in the last week. He assessed the severity of headache as 10/10 with a visual analog scale. Also, the patient was experiencing orthopneic dyspnea while coughing. It was learned that he had previous contact with a SARS-CoV-2-positive individual.\n\n【8】In the initial physical examination, he seemed to have mild dyspnea and tachypnea, body temperature was 39.5°C, heart rate: 110/min, respiratory rate: 38/min, and oxygen saturation: 88% (without oxygen support). Pulmonary auscultation revealed diffuse sibilant and subcrepitant rales on the anterior and posterior parts of both the lungs and on the left basal region at the end of inspiration and beginning of expiration. Rest of the physical examination was within the normal limit. According to the laboratory results, initial leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and platelet counts were decreased. In his routine biochemistry, AST and ALT levels were increased . Prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 such as CRP, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels were mildly elevated. PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were detected by nasopharyngeal swabs as positive twice. Serum immunoglobulins were within ±2 standard deviations of normal values. Pulmonary CT showed findings consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia. Diffuse ground glass-like consolidated nodular lesions in the left hemithorax of the patient continued to the lower lobes. Ground glass-like nodular lesions were also observed in the peripheral areas in the upper lobe and in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory results of the patient are shown.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The patient’s thorax CT images show radiologic findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. Diffuse ground glass-like consolidated nodular lesions in the left hemithorax continue to the lower lobes.</u>\n\n【11】He was thought to have typical clinical and laboratory findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with underlying pediatric (allergic) asthma. Final diagnosis is confirmed as COVID-19-related pneumonia with preexisting asthma. After diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, he was admitted to the pediatric COVID-19 inpatient service. In addition to maintenance fluid, favipiravir (2x8 tablets on the first day and 2x3 tablets for the rest of 4 days, po) and methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day, iv route) were given for COVID-19. Also, for pneumonia, ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day, 3 gr/day, iv), clarithromycin (15–20 mg/kg/day, 1 gr/day, po), and paracetamol (3-4x15 mg/kg/dose, po) were administered. Since the patient sometimes had up to 39.5°C fever and described an increase in cough and dyspnea during the admission, inhaled corticosteroid 80 mcg 4x1 puffs was added to his treatment on the 4<sup>th</sup> day of admission. Without oxygen support, oxygen saturation (SpO2) level was usually observed at >95%. He was discharged after 1 week when all his complaints regressed, his examination became normal, and 5-day favipiravir treatment was completed. He was later followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic. During follow-ups, his repeated spirometry values were within normal limits and he did not need any physical therapy (we have obtained an informed consent form from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report).\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】We are reporting a rare case of suffering from COVID-19-related pneumonia with preexisting pediatric allergic asthma. As described above in our case with asthma, SARS-CoV-2 positivity in PCR testing and findings of typical ground glass-like opacity in chest CT were consistent with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Because COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, certain diseases (such as congenital heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and some primary immune deficiency diseases) have been identified as a potential risk factor for COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, asthma has not been generally thought as a specific risk factor for severe COVID-19 development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. While some meta-analyses reported almost no data related to asthma patients, some others reported that asthma was thought to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality in hospitals. Where do asthmatic patients stand in this pandemic? Are asthmatic patients more inclined to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection? When afflicted, are asthmatic children at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19? Another issue is if the association between asthma and COVID-19 progress differs according to the age of the patient (adults vs. children) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>.\n\n【15】According to his initial laboratory results, leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and platelet counts decreased, which were related to myelosuppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection . According to the laboratory results, all his immunoglobulin levels were found to be normal except for total IgE. Overall, although these clinical and laboratory findings demonstrated the severity of the disease, the patient overcame the disease without need of oxygen support and intensive care unit treatment. This course was also consistent with a report of Turkish pediatric patients by Karbuz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Similar to our case, this report describes that pediatric asthma patients may have a symptomatic course but do not require mostly intensive care admission. In this report, cough was the key symptom in asthmatic cases (80.0%), and 87.6% of children with asthma were symptomatic (: 0.016). Nevertheless, being asthmatic was not always associated with disease gravity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. After 5 days of favipiravir treatment, liver function test (AST and ALT) levels of our patient were found to be doubled. This may be due to the use of the hepatotoxic effect of paracetamol and/or favipiravir 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In many nations, such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Italy, the asthma prevalence in COVID-19 cases was lesser than that detected in the overall population, while the contradictory findings were demonstrated in the USA, Australia, UK, and Ireland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In a Chinese study, only one of the 182 pediatric cases with COVID-19 was admitted in Wuhan had asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. On the other hand, in Brazil and New York, it was demonstrated that asthma was a common comorbidity, but was not linked with more severe COVID-19 leading to hospitalization or the need for intensive care therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In an online survey of 91 asthma specialists, caring for more than 133,000 pediatric asthma cases in 5 continents, only 14% of the responders described assumed COVID-19 patients among their cases; asthmatic children had mild symptoms in 73% of them, and only 1 patient needed hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Respiratory viruses are one of the recognized triggers of asthma attacks. Conventional coronaviruses are respiratory viruses and have been accused of both upper airway infections and asthma attacks upon infection. Reported entry receptors for most conventional coronaviruses do not include ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Even for asthma patients, it is difficult to distinguish respiratory COVID-19 symptoms such as chest tightness, coughing, and shortness of breath from an asthma exacerbation by other triggers. Consequently, it is crucial to draw attention to the surveillance and active management of chronic preexisting diseases in COVID-19 cases. In a study, mild bronchospasm was noticed in 24% of the cases, and oral steroids were used in only 1 case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In reality, COVID-19 has not been held responsible as an essential driver of viral wheezing or asthma attacks in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Favipiravir as an antiviral agent and anti-inflammatory methylprednisolone were used in his treatment. Corticosteroid therapy is the main treatment for asthma, but its use in viral pneumonia is debatable. Steroids are supposed to be able to antagonize some pathophysiological developments of acute respiratory distress syndrome, comprising extreme inflammatory response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. According to an assessment of the Cochrane system, glucocorticoids can lessen the fatality of cases with severe community-acquired pneumonia as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. There is a complex relationship among asthma, inhaled corticosteroid use, and ACE2 expression. According to Severe Asthma Research Program-3 (SARP-3), the use of inhaled corticosteroids is linked with a decreased level of ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) gene expressions in asthmatic patients which are the key entrance receptors for SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Also, all guidelines and experts suggest that asthma patients continue taking their inhaled corticosteroids using a metered-dose-inhaler (MDI) during this pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Some of the potential mechanisms suggested in the relevant literature for a milder COVID-19 course in asthmatic children are as follows. Seriousness and complications of any SARS-CoV-2 infection are linked with the production of hyperinflammation. In asthmatics, such hyperinflammation could be decreased by several factors including the hindered and ineffective antiviral reaction because of lessened IFN-α production by dendritic and epithelial cells. Nevertheless, the defensive role of eosinophilic inflammation, Th2 type inflammatory mediator (e.g. IL-4/-5/-13) predominance in the respiratory system, and antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of inhaled corticosteroids are also thought to play a strong role. Asthma and respiratory allergy, as a type 2 eosinophilic inflammation, and allergen exposures are connected with decreased expression of the ACE2 gene in bronchial epithelial cells. Eosinophils also might help in the reduction of viral load with subsequent attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26–28\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Due to stay-at-home orders, physical activity is restricted and the risk of contact with COVID-19-positive parents is greatly increased. The longer the stay at home, the greater the risk of further exposure to indoor allergens such as mold, rodents, cockroaches, and tobacco smoke. Indoor air quality and air conditioning will be more essential during stay-at-home times. Therefore, indoor plants where asthmatic children live are also very important as potential attack triggers.\n\n【21】Our strength in this report is that this is a rare allergic asthma case developing severe COVID-19-related pneumonia even under control with maintenance therapy. Our limitation is this is just one case, and it is hard to make definitive conclusion and does not reflect the whole reality on COVID-19 progress in these allergic asthma cases, especially controlled asthma cases.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【23】Although reports/research on asthma and COVID-19 in children have so far been comforting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) stated that “reliant on good judgment, rather than growing data” pediatric patients with asthma, particularly if severe or uncontrolled ones, should be contemplated to be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.\n\n【24】A take-home message from this case is when physicians come across an asthma patient in clinic with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30, 31\\]</u>. Nevertheless, even asthma patients under control could develop SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:04:51", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:05:03", "cost": 12.524}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:05:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:04:51"}

Typically, these patients have evident risk factors including, but not limited to, prior abdominal surgery, personal or family history of gastrointestinal disorders, femoral and inguinal hernias, or neoplasm. In this case, we describe an SBO in a female, professional athlete whose swift, severe symptom onset, rapid resolution with conservative treatment, lack of identifiable risk factors, and prompt return to high level competition without recurrence are certainly unique. A female professional basketball player in her mid-20’s with no past medical history presented with a seven-hour history of worsening abdominal pain beginning in the epigastric region and migrating to the right lower quadrant. Physical exam did not reveal abdominal distension, tympany to percussion, or high-pitched bowel sounds. Initial differential diagnosis included appendicitis, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and other genitourinary pathology. Computed tomography with contrast revealed distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, and decompressed loops of bowel distally, consistent with an SBO. Symptoms resolved after 24 hours with conservative treatment, including decompression with a nasogastric tube. The athlete returned to full participation five days after initial presentation without recurrence of symptoms. Outpatient gastroenterology workup was negative for predisposing conditions. This presentation is rare in the absence of bowel pathology, family history, or prior abdominal surgery. Perhaps, her profession as an athlete, with frequent air travel and extensive exercise, may have contributed to this unique presentation. This case report should serve as a reminder to all providers that SBOs can occur in young, active patients devoid of risk factors. Even in the absence of typical signs on physical examination, providers should use imaging as adjuncts based on their clinical gestalt and utilize conservative management, when appropriate, to maximize chances of recovery with minimal morbidity.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Small bowel obstructions (SBO) occur when a functional or mechanical blockade impairs the transit of chyme, and later air, through the intestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. There are many known risk factors that contribute to the development of an SBO, which include, but are not limited to, prior abdominal surgery, personal or family history of inflammatory bowel disease, personal history of neoplasm, femoral and inguinal hernias, or gastrointestinal motility disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In the absence of these risk factors, idiopathic SBOs rarely occur in the young, athletic population, possibly because of regular exercise habits. Moderate exercise has been proven to accelerate transit of chyme, feces, and gas within the intestines, thereby reducing the likelihood of SBO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. This case is unique in that the patient’s presentation was more typical of appendicitis or a gynecologic pathology; thus, SBO was not suspected until computed tomography (CT) revealed a transition point and bowel wall edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Given that this diagnosis is so uncommon in this population, there is a paucity of data stating when it is safe to return to athletic competition after SBO. Therefore, the medical team used the athlete’s symptoms as the guide in return to play decisions, and she was able to return to full participation five days after presentation without recurrence of symptoms.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A female professional basketball player in her mid-20’s presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a seven-hour history of worsening, sharp abdominal pain. Her pain, reported 7 out of 10 on the numeric rating scale (NRS) and exacerbated by movement with no alleviating factors, began in the epigastric region and migrated to the right lower quadrant. The patient experienced worsening nausea and emesis in the ED, warranting administration of 4 milligrams (mg) of intravenous (IV) ondansetron (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) and infusion of a one liter (L) lactated ringer bolus. Review of systems was negative for diarrhea, constipation, fever, chills, dysuria, or vaginal discharge. The patient had only consumed self-prepared food for the past day and had no recent changes to her diet, sick contacts, or recent illnesses. She had never experienced pain like this previously. Her housemates and close contacts had no similar symptoms. The patient reported a low likelihood of pregnancy, and her last menstrual period was within the last month. She also reported no personal or family history of gastrointestinal disorders, prior pregnancies, or abdominal surgery. At the time of presentation, she denied any prior or current use of medications, alcohol, tobacco, or recreational drugs.\n\n【6】The patient’s initial vital signs were a temperature of 36.8 degree Celsius (°C), blood pressure of 131/65 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), heart rate of 60 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate of 16 per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. She was in apparent discomfort, clutching her abdomen. Her physical exam revealed a nondistended abdomen with normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Tenderness to light and deep palpation in the right lower quadrant was apparent, but there was no guarding, rebound, or tympany to percussion on initial examination.\n\n【7】Initial workup included a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), and lipase, which were all within normal limits. A serum pregnancy test was negative. Urinalysis (UA) was only significant for trace ketones. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast revealed distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, and decompressed loops of bowel distally. Fecalization of the small bowel was also apparent . The preliminary diagnosis was an acute SBO. Within the ED, conservative treatment was initiated including administration of cefazolin (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) 1 gram (g) IV every 8 hours, maintenance of IV fluids at a rate of 125 milliliters per hour (mL/hr), placement of a nasogastric tube, and initiation of nil per os (NPO). The patient was admitted to the general surgery service. The timeline of events is illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showing distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, decompressed loops of bowel distally, and fecalization of small bowel.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Timeline of symptom onset through hospital discharge.

Additionally, they wanted to assess the severity of the SBO; thus, a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound (US) and a small bowel follow-through (SBFT) were ordered, respectively. The US was only significant for trace free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas, and the SBFT showed resolution of the SBO at 12 hours after admission . At this point, a clear liquid diet was added, and gastroenterology (GI) was consulted to rule out inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as the cause of the acute SBO which resolved rapidly. The GI consultants progressed the patient to a soft diet since she had a nonbloody, well-formed bowel movement and ordered a serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), both of which were within normal limits. Thus, it was decided to follow up with GI as an outpatient for further workup. At the time of discharge, the patient was pain free, tolerating regular diet, and passing stool and flatus. At four days after presentation, the athlete’s team physician allowed her to resume light jogging and shooting, followed by a full practice with her teammates later in the day. That same day, she flew with her teammates to the city of their next game. At five days after presentation, the athlete competed in a game and remained symptom-free. The patient was seen by GI seven days after presentation at which point magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) was ordered . The MRE showed no dilation, thickening, or enhancement of the bowel. These findings, coupled with her prior normal CRP and ESR, resulted in low suspicion for an underlying diagnosis of IBD, which would have been a potential predisposing condition for SBO. No other risk factors for SBO were ever identified so the patient’s etiology remains idiopathic. Now, one year later, the patient remains without recurrence.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Upper gastrointestinal study with small bowel follow-through revealing no acute obstruction (radiographic images taken in series and are exhibited chronologically from 1–4.).</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Chronologic depiction of return to play (RTP) and outpatient follow-up with days calculated since the time of symptom onset defined as day 0.

Discussion\n\n【14】Annually, there are 579–654 SBOs per 100,000 people, leading to over 300,000 surgeries in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, it is atypical for a young, healthy, elite female athlete without a history of abdominal surgery or IBD to present with an SBO. In this population, abdominal pain is more frequently attributed to appendicitis, ovarian torsion, acute gastroenteritis, or IBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In the “virgin abdomen, ” defined as having no prior abdominal surgery, Beardsley et al. found adhesions to be the primary cause of SBO when diagnosed by CT and confirmed with laparoscopy; however, in this cohort, CT was only 52.9% accurate, and patients were subjected to unnecessary laparoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Furthermore, Colon et al. reported that presence of a transition zone on CT does not correlate with the need for surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Therefore, the literature supports the decision to care for this patient nonoperatively given her stable appearance, reassuring vital signs, inherent risks of surgical intervention, and high likelihood of the SBO resolving with conservative therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite the inherent limitations of imaging, CT remains the gold standard for workup of presumed SBO since definitive diagnosis with direct visualization via laparoscopy confers the common surgical risks of bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Because this patient lacked the classical findings of abdominal distension, tympany to percussion, and high-pitched bowel sounds, the diagnosis could have been missed if diagnostic imaging had not been pursued 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Despite previous reports that 13% of SBOs do not have identifiable etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, it is important to be aware of unusual causes of SBO which may not be considered in the initial differential diagnosis and may require specific work up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Bezoars, or concretions, are undigested material within the alimentary tract which can cause an SBO resulting in nonspecific symptoms similar to those appreciated in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. There are multiple types of bezoars, including: food bolus bezoars, phytobezoars, and trichobezoars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Food bolus bezoars can stem from simple origins such as incomplete mastication, rapid deglutition, and consuming large nuts or pits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Perhaps, an athlete in a rush may eat quickly and inadvertently increase the risk of a food bolus bezoar. Phytobezoars are primarily composed of undigestible plant fibers and seeds, and as such, a vegetarian diet may increase the patient's risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Trichobezoars are composed of undigested hair and are most frequently associated with trichotillomania with trichophagia. Trichobezoars can be seen in this patient’s age group and should be considered as a possible etiology of SBO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. An extremely thorough clinician would be required to unmask these potential SBO etiologies via in-depth history and exam to uncover eating habits and areas of alopecia; however, in the ED setting, these questions are unlikely to arise. Furthermore, in a retrospective case series, CT scan was only 47% effective in identifying bezoars, so imaging alone cannot be depended upon to reach the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Thus, a high index of suspicion, coupled with history, physical, and diagnostic testing, is necessary to tailor treatment given that few bezoars will pass spontaneously and instead require endoscopic or open surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 18\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Intense physical activity can be another uncommon etiology of SBO. As aforementioned, studies suggest an inverse relationship exists between exercise and gastrointestinal disease with mild to moderate activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Despite this suggestion, de Oliveira and Burini caution that strenuous exercise coupled with dehydration exacerbates the risk of gastrointestinal symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Additionally, van Nieuwenhoven et al. hypothesized that running decreases small bowel transit time and blood flow, thereby increasing SBO risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Therefore, exercise serves both as a preventive measure for long-term GI disease, but in strenuous conditions, may potentiate acute illness.\n\n【18】The list of uncommon etiologies continues with researchers such as Massalou et al. suggesting that even recent air travel may contribute to SBO due to the threat barometric changes pose to hollow viscera. This likens the risk of SBO to the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pneumothorax associated with flight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Although many of the aforementioned etiologies are speculative, careful consideration and awareness of the possibilities helps physicians to make sound medical decisions and tailor the treatment plan to the patient’s unique presentation and risk factors.\n\n【19】Though definitive diagnosis of an SBO necessitates direct visualization via laparoscopy, history, physical examination, and CT were sufficient to suggest the diagnosis of an SBO in this case. Conservative management was successful, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgical risks. Furthermore, the patient was able to return to play more quickly because there was no surgical intervention. Given her comprehensive outpatient workup which failed to reveal any predisposing factors for her SBO, the exact etiology of the SBO remains unknown. This case highlights the importance of clinical acumen and utilization of adjunctive tests, specifically imaging, to render diagnoses and provide treatment suited to the patient’s lifestyle. It also illustrates diagnostic challenges that may come from intrinsic difficulties of patient history taking. In order to identify a rare etiology for an SBO, a physician must be aware of the numerous possibilities and explore them thoroughly with the patient. Furthermore, this patient’s case is unique in that she experienced full resolution of the SBO within twelve hours and returned to elite competition five days after initial presentation, despite the absence of clear recommendations within the literature regarding the timing of safe to return to play after an acute SBO.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:51:52", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:53:27", "cost": 94.95}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:53:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:51:51"}

They may involve visceral organs with a lower percentage. Splenic lymphangioma is a rare tumor. This disease is often seen in children but may be diagnosed incidentally in adults. Most patients are asymptomatic, but in large and multifocal lesions, the patient may have some nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Physical examination may show no specific findings or detect palpable masses. The preoperative diagnosis of splenic lymphangioma is challenging. Histopathological evaluation and sometimes immunohistochemistry tests can result in a definitive diagnosis. In this study, we present an 18-year-old man, with Burkitt’s lymphoma who underwent laparotomy and total splenectomy as a result of cystic lesions discovered accidentally during imaging with the final diagnosis of splenic lymphangioma after histopathological evaluation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Lymphangioma is a benign neoplasm of lymphatic vessels, often affecting children’s head and neck areas. It is uncommon to find lymphangiomas in abdominal organs such as the kidney, adrenal, small bowel mesentery, liver, and spleen. Splenic lymphangioma is very rare and is often found incidentally. Nevertheless, some patients may experience nonspecific signs and symptoms such as abdominal pain and distention. Preoperative diagnosis would be difficult, and overdiagnosis might happen because radiological findings are also not specific. The ultimate diagnosis is usually made by histopathological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. Herein, we report a case of splenic lymphangioma in an adult patient who had a previous case of Burkitt’s lymphoma.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】An 18-year-old man was transferred to our center to be evaluated for splenic lesions, which were found incidentally during a routine annual follow-up for Burkitt’s lymphoma. He had no history of abdominal pain, fever, or weight loss. He has been a case of Burkitt’s lymphoma of the stomach since seven years ago and has received chemotherapy for one year. There was no sign of a disease recurrence, and all earlier ultrasonographic evaluations were unremarkable until the last follow-up, which revealed splenic lesions. Other past medical and family histories were not significant. On physical examination, blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg with a normal pulse rate and temperature, 68 beats per minute and 37.1°C, respectively. The abdomen was soft, and there was no organomegaly. Complete blood count (CBC) (white blood cell (WBC): 4.9 × 103/μl, hemoglobin: 14.2 g/dl, and platelet count: 211 × 103/μl) and liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were within normal ranges. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography revealed a hyperechoic mass measuring 24 mm and a cystic lesion measuring 9 mm in the spleen parenchyma. A spiral CT scan of the abdomen with contrast showed a few near together cystic lesions up to 18 mm in the anterosuperior aspect and a hypoattenuated subcapsular lesion measuring 24 mm in the posterior aspect of the spleen with faint enhancement after administration of contrast, suggestive of lymphomatous infiltration . The patient underwent laparotomy. The splenic lesions were multiple at the time of the operation, so a diagnostic splenectomy was performed for him. Gross sectioning of the spleen showed two multiloculated cystic lesions, the largest measuring 1.5 × 1 × 1 cm and containing some brownish fluid . Histological examination showed multiple large irregular cystic spaces lined by endothelial cells with smooth pinkish fluid in the lumen and lymphoid aggregation consisting of lymphangiomas . Two months later, no clinical or radiologic deficits were noted in a follow-up visit. We obtained the patient’s informed consent for publishing the case report and images. Our institutional approval was not required to publish the case details.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Abdominal spiral CT scan with contrast shows a few near together cystic lesions with faint enhancement after administration of contrast .</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Cut section of the spleen shows two well-defined multiloculated cystic lesions .</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Microscopic assessment shows vascular spaces containing pinkish fluid (a) (H&E × 40). The spaces are lined by endothelial cells (b) (H&E × 200).</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Splenic lymphangioma is a benign cystic neoplasm initially described by Frink in 1885, accounting for <0.007% of all tumors. It typically affects pediatric patients but is rarely found in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Sequestration of lymph tissue, aberrant lymph vessels budding, lack of integration with the venous system, and obstruction of lymph vessels are some theories to explain the pathogenesis of lymphangiomas.\n\n【12】The failure of the primordial lymphatics to connect to the main lymphatic vessels or veins, the lymphatic vessels’ inability to drain into the veins, the abnormal budding of the lymphatic vessels, and chronic inflammation are a few of the hypotheses that have been suggested for the etiopathogenesis of lymphangiomas. Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and vascular endothelial growth factor-R3 are also elevated. However, in adult patients, as in our case, only a tiny defect often exists in the lymphatic system, which can be compensated under healthy conditions. Pathologic conditions associated with an increased lymphatic volume may then result in the development of lymphangioma. There is speculation that trauma and infectious diseases are the catalysts for this development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 9, 10\\]</u>. Similarly, the fact that our patient developed a new splenic lesion that was not present in previous radiologic studies suggests that prior surgery and chemotherapy may have served as a trigger.\n\n【13】Clinical presentations depend on the tumor size. Most patients are asymptomatic, and the tumor is found incidentally. Large and multifocal lesions can, however, cause nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite, which are primarily brought on by the compression of nearby organs. Post-traumatic and spontaneous rupture of splenic lymphangiomas has also been reported. Moreover, it can lead to coagulopathy, hemorrhage, and portal hypertension. Physical examination is unremarkable or may detect a palpable mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 11–13\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Radiological findings are generally not specific. Splenic lymphangiomas in ultrasonography may appear as anechoic, hypoechoic, or hyperechoic lesions depending on whether the lymphatic fluid is infected, hemorrhagic, or hyperlipidemic. They have different diameters, with or without internal septation. Calcification is a nonspecific finding and may also be observed in splenic hydatid cysts. Like in our case, computed tomography (CT) scan reveals single or multiple well-defined thin-walled lesions that are usually hypodense, homogenous, and without significant contrast enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 12, 14\\]</u>. The lesions are often well-vascularized in angiography.\n\n【15】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows hypointense cystic lesions in T1-weighted images, yet on T2-weighted images, they look hyperintense when filled with hemorrhagic or proteinaceous material. There have been some reported instances of lymphangioma without F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. However, they may exhibit slightly enhanced F-18 FDG uptake as a result of lymphocytes and fluid joining the dilated lymphatic vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6, 15–19\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Gross appearance shows single or multiple cystic lesions in various sizes with a thick fibrous wall filled with clear fluid. Multiple lesions may have a honeycomb look. Histopathological evaluation reveals cystic lesions lined by endothelial cells and filled with an amorphous eosinophilic proteinaceous substance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 20, 21\\]</u>. Moreover, lymphangiomas are divided into three categories based on the size of the dilated lymphatic channels: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> capillary (supermicrocystic), 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> cavernous (microcystic), and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> cystic (macrocystic) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Immunohistochemistry can be used when there is a doubt about the ability to differentiate cystic lesions of splenic lymphangioma from other cystic lesions such as mesothelial cysts, epidermoid cysts, and parasite cysts. The cells lining the cystic walls in splenic lymphangioma stain positive for CD34, CD31, factor VIII, vascular endothelial growth factor 3, and podoplanin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22–24\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Total splenectomy is the recommended treatment choice after the diagnosis is confirmed to reduce the risk of consequences such as infection, bleeding, growth, and expansion of the lesions and spleen rupture. Splenic lymphangioma has a favorable outcome after total splenectomy, and the possibility of malignancy is scarce 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Our patient’s history of Burkitt’s lymphoma resulted in a misdiagnosis of lymphomatous involvement in a CT scan study. However, if used, MRI and PET scans could aid with a more precise diagnosis and prevent misdiagnosis. In addition, since the lesions were located superficially in the spleen, a more accurate preoperative diagnosis might result in cyst excision rather than an unnecessary total splenectomy.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】Splenic lymphangioma is an extremely rare tumor. Although this benign entity frequently affects children, it should be taken into consideration as a differential diagnosis in adults with acquired cystic lesions, especially in those who have already experienced intra-abdominal stress (surgery, trauma, infection, and so on).\n\n【22】#### Abbreviations\n\n| CBC: | Complete blood count |\n| --- | --- |\n| WBC: | White blood cell |\n| AST: | Aspartate aminotransferase |\n| ALT: | Alanine aminotransferase |\n| ALP: | Alkaline phosphatase |\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| FDG: | Fluorodeoxyglucose |\n| PET: | Positron emission tomography. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:48:16", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:48:37", "cost": 21.911}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:48:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:48:15"}

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 26-year-old male patient was referred to the General Public Hospital in Sikka Regency, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, with presentations of loss of consciousness and jaundice. The patient initially developed fever, headache, and abdominal pain since 14 days before being admitted to our hospital. Several days before, he was treated for dyspepsia in another primary health center, which did not get better, and he was treated for the same diagnosis in a private clinic. As his symptoms were persistent, he was transferred to the regional public hospital in his area. At that moment, peripheral blood smear revealed Plasmodium falciparum and parasitemia with a density of 176,000 parasites/μL (3.52%) . His past medical and travelling history was insignificant. He worked as a farmer and never used a mosquito repellent before. First dose of intravenous antimalarial artesunate (168 mg) was commenced, and repeated dose was followed at 12 hours afterwards. As he had an episode of seizure and acute kidney injury, after which his consciousness declined progressively, the patient was transferred to our hospital.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Peripheral blood smear of Plasmodium falciparum  legends.

Physical examination was significant for icteric sclera, copious hematemesis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and black colored urine. Baseline and follow-up laboratory findings during hospitalization are shown in Table 1. Initial laboratory tests were notable for acute kidney injury (creatinine 12.8 mg/dL, urea 529 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen 246.87 mg/dL), elevated transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase 214 U/L and alanine aminotransferase 409 U/L), anemia (9.8 g/dL), and thrombocytopenia (61,000/μL). He tested negative for HBsAg, negative for anti-HCV, and negative for anti-HIV. Chest X-ray demonstrated normal lung presentation.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Patient’s laboratory findings during hospitalization.</u>\n\n【9】The patient was diagnosed with severe malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum with multiple organ dysfunction: acute symptomatic seizure, acute kidney injury, jaundice, anemia, and copious hematemesis. The patient underwent emergent hemodialysis and intravenous artesunate was given at 24 hours and continued daily. Other symptomatic and supportive treatments such as parenteral feeding, broad-spectrum antibiotic, and anticonvulsant were also given. On the second day, his clinical condition did not improve, although we observed initial downtrend in urea, serum creatinine, and liver enzymes levels. He remained feverish and agitated.\n\n【10】The second hemodialysis was performed in the following days, and he received 250 cc of packed red cell blood transfusion. A repeated malarial blood smear was negative for malarial parasite on the fourth day of hospitalization . Subsequently, on the seventh day, the patient’s condition stabilized. He was alert, obeyed the command, and began enteral feeding. Intravenous artesunate was switched to oral dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (160 mg/1,280 mg) and primaquine (15 mg). Physical examination revealed no icteric sclera and improved urine color .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Urine collected on day 1 and day 3 since presentation legends.

His hospitalization concluded with six doses of intravenous artesunate, three sessions of hemodialysis, three doses of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), and a single dose of primaquine. The patient’s condition improved significantly without any sequelae, and he was discharged and evaluated in the outpatient clinic.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Malaria continues to be a major global health problem, an epidemic in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, America, and Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Indonesia is one of the malaria-endemic countries, and the majority of malaria cases are concentrated in Eastern Indonesia. The following provinces have the high prevalence of malaria: Papua, West Papua, East Nusa Tenggara, North Maluku, and Maluku 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As the Indonesian Ministry of Health has a target to eliminate malaria transmission completely by 2030, in recent years, the malaria elimination program in Indonesia has shown particularly positive progress. Between 2007 and 2017, the annual parasite incidence (API) in Indonesia fell by three times, from 2.89 per 1000 to 0.9 per 1000. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> According to a local provincial report, in 2022, East Nusa Tenggara province has declared major reduction in malarial cases with an API value of 2,2 per 1000 population. Of 22 districts, there are 12 districts categorized as low-endemic areas (API <1 per 1000), and 7 districts have reached zero transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Within East Nusa Tenggara province, the highest prevalence of malaria is in Sumba Island, while more than half of the districts in Flores Island have officially been reported malaria-free. This achievement marked that East Nusa Tenggara province has gradually approached its malaria elimination goal . In this case, the patient came from East Flores district in Flores Island, categorized as a low-endemic area.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Malaria endemicity map of East Nusa Tenggara province (November 2022).</u>\n\n【16】Severe malaria is most commonly caused by infection with Plasmodium falciparum. The World Health Organization defines specific clinical findings and laboratory results for severe malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Cerebral malaria had the highest case fatality rate ranging from 16% to 35%, whereas respiratory distress had a case fatality rate of 20.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Another study revealed that the mortality of severe malaria was higher in patients with impaired consciousness (26.5%), severe anemia (11.5%), and acute kidney injury (10%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Severe manifestations in this case report were impaired consciousness with convulsion, acute kidney injury, jaundice, anemia, and copious hematemesis.\n\n【17】Cerebral malaria is a fatal neurological complication that mostly occurs in children and pregnant women, while the mortality rate of cerebral malaria is higher in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our case, severe malaria likely occurred due to a delay in the diagnosis. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Mousa et al. showed that a prolonged treatment delay (3-≥4 days) was at a 2.4-fold risk of developing cerebral malaria versus treatment ≤24 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The neurological damage induced by cerebral malaria may be lethal when treatment is delayed or in the setting of limited resources 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Our patient is a young immunocompetent adult, and he had a Plasmodium falciparum parasite density of 3.5%. This parasitemia could have potentially induced endothelial lesions of the blood-brain barrier, resulting in brain ischemia and neurological damage. Fortunately, after intravenous artesunate and supportive treatment were initiated periodically, his consciousness gradually improved, and he was discharged without any neurological deficit.\n\n【18】According to the WHO criteria for severe malaria, AKI is defined as a serum creatinine >3 mg/dL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is associated with a mortality as high as 75% when renal replacement therapy (RRT) is not started in time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The incidence of AKI in severe malaria patients varies across studies, with the AKI incidence rate reached as high as 52.5% in malarial patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. Prompt dialysis has been associated with a 25% mortality reduction and a 30% improvement in renal function among malarial patients with AKI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. On admission, our patient showed elevated urea and serum creatinine levels with significant uremic manifestations. Thus, he underwent emergent hemodialysis. During hospitalization, laboratory results showed gradual renal function improvement after three hemodialysis sessions.\n\n【19】The presence of jaundice in malaria indicates a more severe illness with a higher incidence of complications and mortality. Jaundice developed in our patient was caused by hepatic dysfunction and damaged red blood cells during acute malaria illness, resulting in anemia and black water fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Black water fever is hemoglobinuria from massive intravascular hemolysis, characterized by the black-tea color of urine, as seen in our patient. Black water fever also occurs in G6PD deficiency patients who take particular drugs. However, we cannot perform G6PD examination as it is unavailable in our hospital. Subsequently, after days of treatment, our patient showed improved transaminases and bilirubin levels, and urine color progressively switched from black-tea to yellowish color .\n\n【20】The presence of rapidly progressing anemia in malaria needs prompt treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. During the acute phase of the illness, our patient showed progressive anemia; thus, he received packed red cell blood transfusion. Interestingly, our patient also showed massive hematemesis when admitted to our hospital. Even though complicated falciparum malaria may develop bleeding manifestations, they rarely present with overt bleeding in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The pathogenesis of bleeding in malaria is believed to result from platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy which leads to thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Albeit gastrointestinal endoscopy was not performed, we suggested that the stress-related gastric erosions in severely ill conditions were the sources and that thrombocytopenia with dysfunctional platelets could have been the etiology of hematemesis in our patient. In studies evaluating gastric-related symptoms in malarial patients, mucosal edema and congestion (gastritis) were the majority endoscopic findings; thus, gastritis should be considered in malaria infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The risk of mortality is increased if treatment of uncomplicated malaria is delayed. The possibility of mortality increased by almost four times in patients who delayed consultation by a day compared to those who came in very early 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Recognizing and prompt treatment is, therefore, of vital importance. The highly variable presentation of malaria may mimic that of many other diseases creating misdiagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This case was initially suspected as dyspepsia syndrome before being referred to our hospital. After two weeks since the initial symptoms appeared, the patient was diagnosed with Plasmodium falciparum malaria and developed severe complications. He was treated in the intensive care unit because of multiorgan dysfunction due to the delayed malaria diagnosis. We thought that the delayed diagnosis is due to lack of consideration of malaria as differential diagnosis, even in low-endemic areas, causing severe complications similar to our case. Recent local data showed that East Nusa Tenggara province has declared major reduction of malaria cases and most of the districts have been downgraded to low transmission area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This important achievement, however, may cause inadvertence and reluctance of physician to perform malarial screening. The patient came from a low malaria-endemic district (East Flores) in Flores Island; hence, severe and life-threatening complications should not have occurred if diagnosis and surveillance of malaria had been performed properly. Fortunately, prompt treatment with intravenous artesunate and other appropriate treatment prevented the patient from deteriorating.\n\n【22】Therefore, to modify the mortality risk, even in low-endemic malaria areas, physicians should remain meticulous and have high suspicion of malaria in patients presenting with nonspecific manifestation. Additionally, lack of experience in malaria diagnosis and misdiagnosis of diseases in primary health care lead to delayed diagnosis and life-threatening complications, ultimately increasing the mortality risk among patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】Negligence and late diagnosis of malaria infection lead to severe complications and a worse prognosis. While several factors may influence a patient’s prognosis, intravenous artesunate must be initiated as early as possible to maximize the chance of recovery. Close monitoring and other supportive medical care are also critical. Despite major reduction of malaria cases in endemic areas, physicians should remain meticulous and eager to perform malarial screening even without specific manifestations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:06:15", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:06:32", "cost": 17.034}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:06:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:06:14"}

She had a history of smoking 15 cigarettes per day for 55 years but no history of alcohol consumption. On initial clinical examination, her weight was of 50.8 kg, height was 158 cm, body mass index was 20.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and BSA was 150 m<sup>2</sup>. Mild anemia was revealed in the palpebral conjunctiva. No abnormal murmur could be heard on auscultation although dry rales were heard in both lungs.\n\n【8】Laboratory test results demonstrated a markedly elevated white blood cell count (266 × 10<sup>2</sup>/μL; normal: 39–94 × 10<sup>2</sup>/μL) with 81% neutrophils, mild anemia (red blood cell count: 322 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; normal: 367–479 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; hemoglobin: 9.8 mg/dL; normal: 11.5–14.9 mg/dL), elevated platelet count (56.9 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; normal: 13–33 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL), mild renal dysfunction (serum creatinine: 0.96 mg/dL; normal: 0.47–0.79 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen: 23.4 mg/dL; normal: 7–20 mg/dL), mild hyponatremia (133 mEq/mL; normal: 137–146 mEq/mL), mild hypercalcium (11.4 mg/mL; normal: 8.4–10 mg/dL), and markedly elevated C-reactive protein level (14.0 mg/dL; normal: 0–0.3 mg/dL). The tumor marker squamous cell carcinoma antigen was also elevated (5.5 ng/mL; normal: 0–1.5 ng/mL).\n\n【9】Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed interstitial shadows in both lungs.

Therefore, the cooccurrence of a respiratory tract infection was suspected. The administration of antibiotics was initiated (sulbactam/ampicillin at 3.0 g/day for 6 days, and, subsequently, pazufloxacin at 1000 mg/day for 4 days).

Chemotherapy was recommended, but she declined. Therefore, she was administered best supportive therapy. She was discharged 19 days after her admission, after which she visited our institution regularly. However, she was transferred by ambulance because of dyspnea, and she died of hypoxemia due to interstitial pneumonia exacerbation two months after diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Colony-stimulating factor (CSF) is one that promotes colony formation by leukocytes and other cells. G-CSF promotes granulocyte colony formation and is produced by macrophages, fibroblastic cells, and vascular endothelial cell. G-CSF also modulates differentiation and proliferation of granulocytes. In healthy individuals, G-CSF is present at very low levels in the blood circulation, and there is no correlation between circadian changes in serum G-CSF levels or leukocyte and granulocyte counts.\n\n【18】Lung cancer is known to be accompanied paraneoplastic syndromes such as leucocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In 1966, Bardley and Metcalf 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> confirmed the concept of CSF as a humoral factor that promoted the proliferation of bone marrow stem cells. Robinson 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> provided evidence of CSF in the urine and serum of patients with malignant tumors. G-CSF is a cytokine associated with granulocytosis. In lung cancer with leukocytosis, tumor cells presumably produce G-CSF.\n\n【19】In 1977, Asano et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> reported that tumor cells could produce G-CSF and these tumors were designated as G-CSF-producing tumors. G-CSF-producing tumors are diagnosed when 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> there is marked leukocytosis without any other known cause, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> there is elevated serum G-CSF level, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> there is a decline in white blood cell counts after tumor resection, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> there is evidence of G-CSF production in tumor tissues.\n\n【20】In the past, evidence of G-CSF production in tumor tissues required methods showing in vitro colony formation, measuring G-CSF levels after transplanting tumor cells into nude mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, or detecting G-CSF mRNA in tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>; therefore, their clinical application was quite complex. However, with improvements in enzyme immunoassay methods, it has become possible to measure serum G-CSF levels. Moreover, with improvements in anti-G-CSF monoclonal antibodies, it has become possible to provide evidence for G-CSF localization in tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry methods.\n\n【21】Takahashi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> reported that, for the diagnosis of G-CSF-producing tumors, the confirmation of increased serum G-CSF levels and positive immunostaining with an anti-G-CSF antibody were sufficient. Among patients with G-CSF-producing tumors, some may present with fever or have elevated C-reactive protein levels because of other cause of leukocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. G-CSF itself has no effect for causing fever or increasing C-reactive protein levels; therefore, the presence of inflammatory cytokines other than G-CSF is suggested. IL-6 is a promoter of G-CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, and IL-6 produced by tumors can cause not only G-CSF production but also fever and elevated C-reactive protein levels.\n\n【22】Currently, there is no clear definition for IL-6-producing tumors. Fujino et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> provided evidence for production of IL-6 by measuring IL-6 levels produced by cultured tumor cells. In our case, in addition to the elevated serum IL-6 level, the confirmation of IL-6 in tumor cells from a biopsy specimen by immunostaining may have provided evidence for IL-6 production by tumor cells. Our case is significant because IL-6 production was demonstrated by pathological examinations.\n\n【23】Histologically, G-CSF-producing lung cancer comprises giant cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, G-CSF-producing lung cancer has poor prognosis with low-grade tumors and has the potential to invade into vessels and metastasize to lymph nodes. Even in resected cases, two-year mortality is as high as 15% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Prognosis of G-CSF-producing tumors is poor, mortality over one year is as high as 12%, and the mean survival time is five months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. It is unclear if the reason for poor prognosis is the high malignancy potential of G-CSF-producing tumors or the G-CSF itself produced by tumors.\n\n【25】Many G-CSF-producing tumors are suggested to be biologically highly malignant, poorly differentiated, and highly invasive to local lesions and vessels for the following reasons: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> autocrine tumor growth because of the emergence of G-CSF receptors on tumor cells, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> promotion of tumor growth and spread by proliferating neutrophils because of G-CSF, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the inhibition of cellular immunity mediated by macrophages or natural killer cells by G-CSF. These mechanisms are presumably associated with tumor growth and spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Tumors that secrete autocrine growth factors show rapid progression. Moreover, the spread of tumor cells is closely associated with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is a known growth factor for macrophages and granulocytes. G-CSF-producing tumors probably produce cytokines other than G-CSF; thus, establishing a method to measure several cytokines simultaneously is desirable.\n\n【27】G-CSF- and IL-6-producing lung cancer is comparatively rare because we could find only 5 reports concerning G-CSF- and IL-6-producing lung cancer in PubMed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–21\\]</u>. If the serum G-CSF and IL-6 level are measured commonly in lung cancer presenting with elevated white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein level, the more G-CSF and IL-6-producing lung cancer could be found.\n\n【28】When leukocytosis without evidence of infection is found in solid cancer including lung cancer, the serum G-CSF-level should be measured to examine whether tumor cells secrete G-CSF. When G-CSF-producing tumor is diagnosed, the administration of antibiotics is unnecessary. If tumor can be resected, surgical treatment should be considered.\n\n【29】Inoue et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> reported a case of G-CSF- and IL-6-producing lung cancer showing elevated G-CSF and IL-6 level in tumor cells; although they showed the expression of G-CSF receptors on the surface of tumor cell, they could not show the expression of IL-6. In their case, although tumor cells secrete IL-6, IL-6 did not affect the proliferation of tumor cells. As in our case, we did not examine the expression of G-CSF receptors and IL-6 receptors; therefore, it is really unknown whether G-CSF and IL-6 are associated with the proliferation of tumor cells.\n\n【30】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】We encountered a case of lung squamous cell carcinoma that produced both G-CSF and IL-6. When encountering patients with malignant tumors who present with elevated white blood counts and C-reactive proteins levels, serum G-CSF and IL-6 measurements and immunostaining tumor cells with anti-G-CSF and anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies should be considered for diagnosis of G-CSF- and IL-6-producing tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:11", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:10:21", "cost": 9.508}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:10:11"}

She had received a blow to her anterior chest 2 months back, but she did not seek immediate medical consultation at that time. The patient reported no history of major medical diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or renal disease, and she did not smoke, consume alcohol, or take any medications. Physical examination revealed a firm and tender mass in the lower region of the left breast. No lymph nodes were palpable in the bilateral axillary fossa and cervix. Ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic mass with a hyperechoic boundary toward the subcutaneous tissue . Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 20,000/μL and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 12.3 mg/dL. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 15-3, and NCC-ST-439 were all within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large mass measuring 10 cm × 10 cm in the lower region of the left breast, with pleural and skin thickening and fracture of the fifth rib under the mass . Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with fat suppression revealed a low-signal intensity mass in the lower region of the left mammary gland, and contrast enhancement revealed its border and the adjacent pleura .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | The patient presents with left breast swelling. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Ultrasound showing a hypoechoic mass with a hyperechoic boundary toward the subcutaneous tissue (arrow). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | (a) Computed tomography (CT) showing a large mass in the lower region of the left breast.

An irrigation drain was inserted into the abscess cavity. Antibiotic therapy with an ampicillin-sulbactam combination was administered and saline irrigation (1000 mL/day) via the drain was performed. GAS was susceptible to the ampicillin-sulbactam combination.\n\n【11】WBC and CRP levels declined to their normal limits on the 5th day of admission; therefore, antibiotic administration was discontinued.

During surgery, we found that the pectoralis major muscle at the level of the fifth rib had markedly thinned; this necrotic tissue made no contact with the mammary gland. On the basis of these findings, a final diagnosis of chest wall abscess was made. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged 12 days after surgery. There has been no evidence of recurrence for six months after surgery.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Primary chest wall abscess is a rare clinical entity, occurring as a result of the hematogenous spread of bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial pathogens. Chest wall abscess occurring because of the spread of infection from the lungs or pleura or that occurring after open trauma or thoracic wall surgery is classified as secondary chest wall abscess. Chest wall abscess can evolve from a simple soft-tissue infection, osteomyelitis of the rib(s), infection of the costochondral junction with destruction of the surrounding ribs, or infection of the sternoclavicular joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Treatment differs with the extent of infection and includes simple administration of routine antibiotic therapy or multiple and prolonged drainage and complex reconstructive surgeries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The necessity for correct diagnosis cannot be underestimated because fulminant infections can occur in aged or immunocompromised patients if treated incorrectly. Prompt and appropriate surgical management and antibiotic therapy affect the treatment outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Our patient developed a chest wall abscess 2 months after receiving a blunt chest trauma, and CT revealed a fracture in her left fifth rib under the abscess. We could not determine the route of entry of GAS into the bloodstream because the patient had been asymptomatic, had received no dental treatment or cut wounds for several months prior to the chest wall abscess, and had no preexisting disease. GAS bacteremia probably resulted from penetration of the skin following minor skin abrasion or trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. GAS is one of the most common human pathogens, and it can cause a variety of skin and soft-tissue infections, some of which are severe and even life-threatening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. We assumed that the patient developed GAS bacteremia in some manner, because of which the soft tissue around the fractured left fifth rib became infected. The fifth rib was located under the breast, so her initial presentation was breast swelling. Inflammatory breast cancer should be considered as a differential diagnosis of such swellings. However, breast cancer in our patient was excluded after the detection of pus and the absence of malignant cells on cytological examination. We also excluded breast abscess because the patient was not lactating, and the absence of inflammation in the left mammary gland was confirmed during surgery.\n\n【17】We performed a PubMed search of the English literature from 1966 to the present using the following keywords: chest, abscess, and blunt trauma. We also retrieved cases from the relevant reference lists. There were seven previous reports of primary chest wall abscess occurring after blunt chest trauma  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6–11\\]</u>. Fractures were found in 4 of 8 cases. In five cases, the abscess appeared more than 2 months after the blunt trauma for reasons that remained unclear. The primary focus of infection remained unclear in six cases, and in five of these six cases, the pathogenic bacteria were indigenous skin bacteria. The treatment differed depending on the extent of infection.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Reported cases of primary chest wall abscess occurring after blunt chest trauma.</u>\n\n【19】In summary, we report a case of primary chest wall abscess that developed after blunt chest trauma and initially mimicked a breast tumor. Because abscess formation was behind the mammary gland, breast tumor should be considered a differential diagnosis. Although the precise mechanism of this infection remained unclear, the patient’s condition improved without extensive debridement. If we had performed surgical debridement first, the patient would have been discharged earlier. In conclusion, this report suggests that chest wall abscess should be considered as a differential diagnosis when a patient presents with breast swelling and reports a history of blunt chest trauma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:54:42", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:55:02", "cost": 20.063}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:34", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:55:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:54:41"}

In the case of an extra-articular osteotomy to correct flexion or extension alignment, treatment can be indicated despite the presence of posttraumatic arthrosis of an incongruent elbow joint. However, intra-articular osteotomy treatment is only considered when the patient is seen early and secondary post-traumatic arthritis is at an early stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Intra-articular corrective osteotomy for malunited fractures of the distal humerus is technically demanding and the literature on this subject scarce 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>.

Case Report\n\n【7】Our patient was a 48-year-old dentist who was seen 10 months after a high energy fall that resulted in a complex type C3 intra-articular fracture of her left nondominant distal humerus . Initial treatment performed at an outside institution consisted of static external fixation with the arm in flexion and the forearm in neutral rotation . The external fixator was removed after 8 weeks and the follow-up radiographs revealed delayed union which resulted in intra-articular malunion of the distal humerus. The patient was referred to the senior author (RKM) with substantial overlength of the capitellum resulting in 25 degrees cubitus varus deformity. Flexion extension arc was 95 degrees with a 35-degree flexion contracture. Her forearm rotation was normal. She did not have pain and did not opt for surgery at this point. Four months later, she reported substantial pain and lost all her active motion. The patient opted for surgery mainly to regain extension in order to return to work. Neurological examination was unremarkable. She had no signs of ulnar neuropathy.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Our patient was a 48-year-old dentist who was seen 10 months after a high energy fall that resulted in a complex intra-articular fracture of her left nondominant distal humerus.

A midline posterior incision, with medial and lateral skin flaps elevated, was used. The olecranon osteotomy provided a complete overview of the dorsal distal humerus, including the radiohumeral joint and the ulnar nerve. An oscillating saw was used to create a trapezoid wedge to correct overlength varus of the lateral column and flexion of the capitellum in order to realign capitellum and trochlea. Extreme caution was taken no to disrupt the anterior blood supply of the capitellum. A second supracondylar wedge was resected to correct cubitus varus and 20 degrees of internal rotation. The capitellum radii was fixed to the ulnar condyle using an isolated lag screw . Iliac crest bone graft was used to improve bone healing and fixation was achieved with a lateral 7hour-LCDC plate and screws. The olecranon osteotomy was fixed with screw-tension band technique . Intraoperative ulnohumeral motion was 90 degrees of flexion with full extension after debridement of the olecranon fossa. The elbow was placed in a cast in full extension for 24 hours.\n\n【10】She had loss of anterior translation of the distal end of the humerus resulting in 90 degrees of flexion and 5 degrees of hyperextension of the left elbow . The patient was satisfied initially with her stable function elbow and 95 degrees of ulnohumeral motion. However, 18 months postoperatively she decided to have removal of hardware and an extra-articular excavation of the prominent ventral distal humerus creating a new fossa coronoidea in order to gain flexion. Her final flexion improved to 110 degrees with 5 degrees of hyperextension . She had a functional outcome, quantified as 95 points by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Elbow Evaluation Instrument and the Mayo Elbow Performance Index. Continuous passive motion was initiated 24 hours after surgery and therapy was started.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to specifically address intra-articular osteotomy to treat distal humerus malunion. However, small series have been published as part of surgical technique and clinical outcome papers on intra- and extra-articualar malunion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. McKee and Jupiter reported on two malunited fractures of the distal humerus that underwent intra-articular osteotomy in a series of distal humerus malunion and nonunion with good results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The cornerstone of treatment of fractures of the distal humerus is operative reduction and internal fixation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–13\\]</u>. Pessimism regarding these fractures is not justified with contemporary methods of internal fixation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However, routine in treatment does not exist due to the rarity of these fractures. In addition, the complex articular surface and meager amount of cancellous bone still makes operative treatment a substantial challenge.\n\n【14】Nonunion and malunion of distal humerus fractures treated operatively is rare. Only 2% of all fractures involve the distal humerus, and 2% of these result in malunion. Intra-articular osteotomy for malunion to achieve a functional arc of motion and to prevent subsequent posttraumatic arthritis in the elbow joint is rarely indicated in the young demanding patient. Therefore, experience with treatment of intra-articular malunited fractures is very limited and reports seldom appear in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>. We feel that total elbow arthroplasty for malunion of the distal humerus is a treatment option reserved for low-demand elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【15】If the patient present at an early stage, an intra-articular osteotomy is considered if original fracture lines can be osteotomized and posttraumatic arthrosis is limited. Extra-articular osteotomy is indicated when intra-articular congruency of the elbow joint cannot be restored and secondary posttraumatic arthrosis is too advanced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. Preoperative planning is paramount to assess if it is technically feasible to restore ulnohumeral congruency .\n\n【16】Stability of the elbow joint and a functional arc of motion were achieved in this case. After intra-articular osteotomy, the patient had only 90 degrees of flexion due to loss of anterior translation of the distal humerus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Initial loss of flexion was accepted by patient and surgeon to avoid devascularization of the distal end of the humerus. After avoiding too much dissection during the index procedure in case one, the patient opted for a successful subsequent procedure to gain flexion. Satisfactory functional outcome was quantified by the Mayo Elbow Performance Index and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Instrument.\n\n【17】Surgical reconstruction of the intra-articular malunited distal humerus is technically challenging but can improve function in the young active adult by restoring intrinsic anatomy of the elbow.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 14:04:12", "endTime": "2024/09/23 14:05:04", "cost": 52.187}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-22 22:05:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 22:04:11"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Williams-Beuren’s syndrome is a rare familial multisystem disorder that occurs in 1 per 20,000 live births. It is characterized by congenital heart defects (CHD), neonatal hypercalcemia, skeletal and renal anomalies, cognitive disorder, social personality disorder, and dysmorphic facies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The neurocognitive profile of Williams’ syndrome most commonly includes mild mental retardation. Cognitive strengths and weaknesses relative to other patients with mental retardation include relatively good auditory rote memory but extreme difficulty with visuospatial construction tasks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Most of patients with Williams’ syndrome have CHDs, which typically include supravalvar aortic stenosis and/or supravalvular pulmonary stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Patient with Williams’ syndrome may commonly develop hypertension either because of renal artery stenosis or other undefined etiologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Approximately 90% of patients with the clinical diagnosis of Williams’ syndrome have a deletion at chromosome 7q11.23, which can be detected by FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization). The genes mapping to this region have been defined and include the elastin gene, ELN. Mutations within the elastin gene have also been found in patients with isolated supravalvar aortic stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>, and deletion of the elastin gene in patients with Williams’ syndrome is thought to account for the cardiovascular phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】This paper present a 5-year-old girl that referred to pediatric cardiologist because of heart murmurs. She had a systolic heart murmur (2-3/6) in her right upper sternal border with radiation to right cervical region. The patient had a typical face with bulge forehead , and also she had a speech problem; although she had a good auditory rote memory and could follow the orders, she could not normally say the words and sentences. Echocardiography (GE vivid S5) with probe 5 MHz revealed a mild supraaortic valve stenosis and mild supravalvar and peripheral pulmonary stenosis; then angiography was done and showed: left ventricle injection: mild supraaortic stenosis , in pulmonary artery injection: mild multiple peripheral pulmonary stenosis , and in abdominal aorta injection: bilateral renal arteries stenosis . Left ventricle pressure on cardiac catheterization was 150/0–10 mmHg, and blood pressure in aorta after supravalvar stenosis was 120/60 通用删除7(英):<u>(80)</u> mmHg. After that, with suspicious to Williams’ syndrome, the patient was referred for genetic evaluation. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed , and the result was 46.XX, ish del (7q11.2) (ELN X1) (7q22 X2) ELN deletion compatible with Williams’ syndrome. The diagnosis of Williams’ syndrome was made, and the patient is under observation. In our patient, hemodynamic was normal and there was no sign of cardiac hypertrophy or heart failure; thus the patient is under observation and recurrent echocardiography, and if stenosis gets worse in followup, then surgery may be necessary.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Elfin faces. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Angiography.

Discussion\n\n【12】This paper is about a case of Williams’ syndrome that referred to pediatric heart center with heart murmur, cognitive deficit, and typical faces. For evaluating a heart murmur, echocardiography was done and showed a mild supraaortic valve stenosis and mild supravalvar and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Echocardiography with Doppler is highly sensitive in the diagnosis of supravalvular aortic stenosis, but it does not completely delineate the anatomy. Cardiac catheterization with angiography can define the anatomy and physiology in detail, but magnetic resonance imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and multidetector CT-scanning are less invasive, lower-risk methods of accurately defining the anatomy. The risk of cardiac catheterization is significant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>; so angiography was done for this patient and revealed: mild multiple peripheral pulmonary stenosis, mild supraaortic stenosis, and bilateral renal arteries stenosis.\n\n【13】Stenosis of the pulmonary arteries, isolated or in association with other cardiac defects, occurs in 2-3% of congenital heart diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The association of supravalvar aortic stenosis, multiple peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, mental retardation, and peculiar facies has been described as Williams’ syndrome. Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis is also associated with the Noonan syndrome, the Alagille syndrome, cutis laxa, the Ehler-Danlos syndrome, and the Silver-Russell syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Alagille syndrome is defined as the presence of bile duct paucity on liver biopsy in conjunction with three of the following findings: cholestasis, CHDs, skeletal or ocular abnormalities, or typical facial features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>. The Noonan syndrome’s diagnosis is based on the clinical evaluations and it is characterized by hypertelorism, ptosis, short stature, and CHDs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. Our patient had peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis and typical facial feature, but she did not have other signs of these syndromes, and in addition, she had a supravalvular aortic stenosis which is not seen in those syndromes except Williams’ syndrome.\n\n【14】Supravalvular aortic stenosis, estimated to occur in approximately 1 of 25,000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> and accounting for approximately 0.5% of congenital heart diseases cases, but only 30–50% of patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis have Williams-Beuren syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u> and about 20% of cases are familial but without other feature of Williams-Beuren syndrome, and the remaining cases, about half, appear to be sporadic. In our patient, supravalvular aortic stenosis was not isolated and she had other clinical features of Williams’ syndrome: peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, elfin facies, and cognitive deficits.\n\n【15】Most patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis are diagnosed during evaluation of an asymptomatic heart murmur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 20\\]</u>. Systolic murmur is similar to valvular aortic stenosis, most prominent at upper right sternal border with radiation into the suprasternal notch and into the neck. Blood pressure in the right arm is frequently higher than the left arm because of Coanda’s effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. This patient’s diagnosis also was find out during evaluation of heart murmur, and we suggest a more attention for evaluating heart murmur in childhood period especially when the patient has abnormal facial features or mental problem.\n\n【16】If significant supravalvar aortic stenosis is left untreated, cardiac hypertrophy followed by cardiac failure is probable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Although balloon dilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> and stent treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> of supravalvular aortic stenosis have been reported, the close proximity to the aortic valve and coronary artery orifices are significant obstacles, and currently operation is the treatment of choice. The rate of restenosis after the operation with current surgical techniques is very low. Indications for surgery are not clearly defined, and also long-term outcome after surgical repair of supravalvular aortic stenosis is not known. Certainly the presence of symptoms warrants prompt consideration for surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 25\\]</u>. In this case, there was a mild supravalvular aortic stenosis and there were no signs of cardiac hypertrophy or heart failure; thus surgery was not necessary. Aortic stenosis is followed by recurrent echocardiography and if stenosis gets worse in followup, then surgery may be unavoidable. Also the patient's hemodynamic is normal, and if blood pressure get rise due to renal artery stenosis, then renal artery stenting is a choice of treatment.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】According to primary symptoms, paraclinical evaluations, and clinical finding such as elfin faces, neurocognitive deficit, and congenital heart defect, Williams’ syndrome is the first diagnose.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is rarely complicated by amyloidosis. Case. A 66-year-old white male presented to the emergency room (ER) after an unwitnessed fall and change in mental status. Patient was awake and alert but not oriented. There was no focal deficit on neurological exam. Past medical history (PMH) included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, aortic valve replacement (nonmetallic), incomplete heart block controlled by a pacemaker and IgG- IgA type Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance. The MGUS was diagnosed 9 months ago on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) as patient was referred to the outpatient clinic for hyperglobulinemia on routine blood work. In ER, a head-computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions suspicious for metastases. A CT chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed numerous ground-glass and solid nodules in the lungs. Lower extremity duplex and transesophageal echocardiogram were negative. Serial blood cultures and serologies for cryptococcus and histoplasmosis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), cryoglobulin, and antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies were all negative. CT guided lung biopsy was positive for Thioflavin T amyloid deposits. Brain biopsy was positive for eosinophilic material (similar to the lungs) but negative for Thioflavin T stain. The patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate with cold cyanotic fingers developing on day 12 and a health care acquired pneumonia, respiratory failure, and fungemia on day 18. On day 29, family withdrew life support and denied any autopsies. Conclusion. Described is an atypical course of MGUS complicated by amyloidosis of the lung and nonamyloid eosinophilic deposition in the brain. As MGUS might be complicated by diseases such as amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, a scheduled follow-up of these patients is always necessary. Further research is needed in order to better define the optimal treatment and management strategies of MGUS and its complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】B cell dyscrasias are characterized by a clonal proliferation of B cells (benign or malignant). The spectrum of B cell dyscrasia is broad and includes the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. MGUS is found in more than 1% of persons who are 50 years or older and is defined by the presence of a serum monoclonal protein concentration less than 3 g/dL, with absence of lytic bone lesions, of M proteins in urine, of hypercalcemia and of renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Amyloidosis is a rare complication of MGUS which is secondary to excessive production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) and deposition of the single Ig isotype or subunits in various tissues. Aggregomas, on the other hand, are tumoral non-amyloidotic monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain deposits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this paper, we describe an unusual presentation of MGUS combining amyloid deposition in the lung and non-amyloid eosinophilic deposition in the Brain.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】A-66-year-old male, who was exsmoker, presented to the ER for a change in mental status. As per the family, the patient who had a normal mental status in the past was noticed to be progressively worsening for the last couple of months, with disorientation mainly found over phone discussions. At the time of presentation he was awake and alert, but disoriented to time and place. He denied any pain and was unable to provide any history. Physical exam was normal except for the presence of facial ecchymosis. The neurological part showed a normal motor, sensory, and cranial nerve exam. Also, his gait was stable.\n\n【6】Past medical history was significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, aortic valve replacement (nonmetallic), atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), incomplete heart block, pacemaker, and IgG- IgA, kappa type Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS). Family history was not relevant.\n\n【7】MGUS was diagnosed 9 months ago on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) as patient was referred to our institution’s center for cancer and blood related diseases for hyperglobulinemia on routine blood work. At that time the patient underwent extensive work up to rule out any plasma cell dyscrasias. The Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) was negative for M spike. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry from peripheral smear as well as from bone marrow biopsy were negative for a clonal plasma cell or malignant B-cell. Chromosomal analysis and cytogenetics were also normal.\n\n【8】In the ER, a head CT scan revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions suspicious for metastases mainly in the frontal part bilaterally and in the left parieto-temporal region, with edema and compression mainly on the left lateral ventricle. Also, an interventricular lesion at the foramen of Monro causing mild hydrocephalus was seen. CT chest, abdomen and pelvis was done to find a possible primary malignancy and revealed numerous ground-glass and solid nodules in the lungs. Warfarin was discontinued and the international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.2 was reversed with fresh frozen plasma. Patient was started on steroids and phenytoin. Lower extremity duplex was negative.\n\n【9】The clinical status continued to deteriorate with cold, cyanotic fingers developing on day twelve of hospitalization. At this point he was seen by a vascular surgeon in order to rule out arterial emboli. A transesophageal echocardiogram was done for possible vegetations causing infectious emboli. All results were negative, and no infiltrative cardiomyopathy was found. Bronchoscopy and broncho-alveolar lavage with cultures (including nocardia) was also negative. CT guided lung biopsy showed H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) and PAS (periodic acid-schiff) positive amorphous eosinophilic material suspicious for amyloid . Initial staining with congo red was negative. However, it stained positively with Thioflavin T stain and had weak green birefringence under polarized light. Immunostains for kappa and lambda chains showed stronger staining for kappa subtype. Brain biopsy was positive for eosinophilic material (similar to the lungs) but negative for congo red and thioflavin T stain . Later, the patient had a respiratory failure secondary to health care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and was intubated. Serial blood cultures and serologies for Cryptococcus and histoplasmosis, serology for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), cryoglobulin, and Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies (antiGBM) were all negative. Only seen was a positive blood culture for candida on day eighteen.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | CT guided lung biopsy showed H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) and PAS (periodic acid-schiff) positive amorphous eosinophilic material suspicious for amyloid.

Later, he was switched to vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin for possible health care acquired pneumonia. Also, he was started on amphotericin B after blood cultures revealed candida. Whether a more diffuse disease such as systemic amyloidosis is present was not confirmed, as the family refused any further diagnostic procedures that are not relevant to the acute care of the patient in a context of a deteriorating clinical picture. Despite all antifungals and supportive measures, he failed weaning trials and remained on ventilator support. A tracheostomy was suggested. However, after extensive discussions, the family refused. On day 29, health care proxy decided to withdraw all life support measures based on the patient’s previous wishes who did not want to be kept alive on a ventilator. Finally, the patient had a terminal wean after these events, and the family refused any autopsies.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】As we discussed above, MGUS is found in around 1% of persons who are 50 years or older and is defined by the presence of a serum monoclonal protein concentration less than 3 g/dL. MGUS of IgM class can progress to lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia; whereas IgA and IgG can progress to primary amyloidosis or multiple myeloma. B cell lymphoproliferative disorders can cause AL (light chain) amyloidosis, which is very rarely reported in MGUS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. Depending on the type of antibodies secreted, immunoglobulin deposition diseases can be divided into light chain amyloidosis (AL), heavy chain amyloidosis (AH), non-amyloid forms of light chain deposition diseases (LCDD), and heavy chain deposition diseases (HCDD). Coexistence of the amyloid and non-amyloid deposits is very rare, and was first described by Gallo et al. as “monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Biclonal gammopathy was described in less than 3 percent of the Mayo clinic MGUS series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The clinical course and behavior were not significantly different. Our patient had high levels of IgG 3730 mg/dL (range: 751–1560 mg/dL) and IgA 619 (range: 82–453 mg/dL). Immunofixation was positive for kappa chains which was consistent with the amyloid deposits in the lungs. These were highly positive for the kappa immunostaining. Therefore, we can suggest that one of the contributing causes for the respiratory failure in our case might have been the amyloidosis itself.\n\n【16】Also, found in our patient was multiple organizing hemorrhagic brain lesions suspicious for metastasis. However, no primary tumor was found and there was no evidence of lymphoproliferative diseases in the brain or lung biopsies. Hemorrhage in patients with MGUS can be secondary to amyloidosis or cryoglobulinemia. However, finding of eosinophilic non-amyloid material possibly suggests “Aggregoma” which is a very rare entity, only described once previously in the literature, as per our knowledge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Amyloid depositions seen in plasma cell dyscrasias can lead to amyloid angiopathy and secondary hemorrhagic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Light chain deposition diseases might mimic amyloidosis, leading also to bleeding susceptibilities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Our patient might have light chain deposition disease in the brain that did not lead to amyloidosis itself. However, this disease might have been the cause of significant parenchymal hemorrhages.\n\n【17】Further workup in order to define the exact nature of these depositions, like immunohistochemistries, ultra-structural analysis, and mass spectrometry, was not done, mainly due to technical and technological limitations in our institution. Also, we cannot rule out a possible systemic amyloidosis as no further diagnostic testing such as a fat pad biopsy was done. The family refused any workup that is not relevant to the acute care of the patient who was in a critical condition. Also, the final diagnosis was not ascertained as the autopsy was refused.\n\n【18】Although there were some indicators predicting the risk of progression to Multiple Myeloma (serum protein M ≥ 1.5, non-IgG MGUS), till now, there is no known indicators predicting the odds of amyloidosis formation. Periodic monitoring of MGUS is advised, but there is currently no recommended optimal intervals. Many experts recommend routine follow-up between 6 and 12 months. This is based mainly on the potential risk for multiple myeloma progression.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】This case describes two organ specific presentations related to the MGUS disease: amyloid deposition in the lung and non-amyloid eosinophilic deposition in the brain. The possibility of a presence of systemic amyloidosis and the final confirmation of the nature of the non-amyloid depositions in our case were not ascertained, mainly due to the refusal by the family for any autopsies or any further diagnostic procedures, but also view the lack of technological availabilities, mainly staining subtypes in our institution.\n\n【21】Knowing that the course of MGUS can be potentially complicated by amyloidosis, peripheral neuropathies, and multiple myeloma transformations, a scheduled follow-up of these patients is always necessary. Further research is needed in order to establish the optimal treatment guidelines for the complications and diseases related to MGUS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:56:14", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:57:27", "cost": 72.633}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:57:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:56:13"}

Leiomyosarcomas of vascular origin are particularly rare tumors occurring mainly in the inferior vena cava (IVC). They are malignant, slow-growing tumors with a poor prognosis. This paper reports on a rare case of surgical resection of an IVC leiomyosarcoma mimicking a hepatic tumor. Case Presentation. A 65-year-old Japanese male was admitted for evaluation of an abdominal tumor. Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images, with no enhancement or washout in late-phase images. We diagnosed this tumor as either a hepatic tumor in the Spiegel lobe or a retroperitoneal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma and performed a laparotomy. On the basis of surgical findings, we extirpated the tumor by performing a wedge resection of the wall of the IVC and suturing the primary IVC wall. Pathological findings led to a further diagnosis of the tumor as a leiomyosarcoma originating in the IVC. Thirty-seven months after the operation, multiple liver and lung metastases were detected, and the patient died from multiple organic failures. Conclusion. We experienced a rare case of a leiomyosarcoma of IVC mimicking hepatic tumor.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Leiomyosarcomas are malignant tumors of smooth muscle cells that can originate in any location but occur most often in the uterus, retroperitoneum, or intraabdominal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Leiomyosarcomas of vascular origin are particularly rare tumors occurring mainly in the inferior vena cava (IVC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The International Registry of Inferior Vena Cava Leiomyosarcomas revealed that most tumors occur in the lower (44.2%) or middle (50.8%) region of the IVC, while only a small number of tumors occur in the upper third or suprahepatic region (4.2%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Leiomyosarcoma of IVC was first described by Dzsinich et al. in 1992 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. There are no definitive symptoms, but typical symptoms include dyspnea and a general feeling of being unwell accompanied by weight loss and abdominal and/or back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A correct diagnosis is difficult, and, in up to one-third of cases, it is not made until after a postmortem examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Diagnosis is made using modern imaging techniques such as ultrasound, echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In spite of the advancement of modern imaging techniques, it is difficult to diagnose a leiomyosarcoma preoperatively, and in some cases it is also difficult to distinguish it from a hepatic tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This paper reports on a rare case of surgical resection of an IVC leiomyosarcoma mimicking a hepatic tumor.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 65-year-old Japanese male was admitted for evaluation of an abdominal tumor. The tumor was detected by chance during a chest CT performed for a lung examination. The patient had no past history of any abdominal surgery, and his vital signs were stable. There is nothing particularly significant in the findings of the laboratory examination. Tumor markers are negative.\n\n【6】Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images , with no enhancement or washout in late-phase images . Magnetic resonance imaging of this tumor revealed a contrasting low intensity on the T1-weighted image  and high intensity on the T2-weighted image . Upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed no evidence of a malignant tumor in the gastrointestinal tract. We diagnosed this tumor as either a hepatic tumor in the Spiegel lobe or a retroperitoneal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images ((a) arrow), with no enhancement and washout in late-phase images ((b) arrow). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen.

To expose the affected IVC lesion, we need to mobilize some parts of the right lobe of the liver. This tumor was not located in the liver but originated in the IVC. We extirpated the tumor by performing a wedged resection of the wall of the IVC and sutured primary IVC wall. We controlled the bleeding from the IVC using the hemostatic forceps. The resected specimen was solid with a smooth surface . Microscopic examination revealed that the tumor consisted of uniform and spindle cells and had a fascicular growth pattern. This pathological feature was compatible with a mesenchymal tumor . Immunohistochemical staining revealed that α\\-SMA and HHF35 were expressed in this tumor , and c-kit and CD34 were negative. The MIB-1 index was about 60% . The tumor was diagnosed as a leiomyosarcoma originating in the IVC. The patient’s recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 10. After 12 months, the tumor was detected in the Spiegel of the liver on enhanced CT of the abdomen . We diagnosed it as a recurrence of the leiomyosarcoma. We suggested to the patient and his family that he should undergo additional treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgical resection, but they declined this. Thirty-seven months after the operation, multiple liver and lung metastases were detected on CT , and the patient died of multiple organic failures.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | The resected specimen was solid with a smooth surface. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Histopathological findings.

Discussion\n\n【15】Leiomyosarcomas originating in the IVC are rare, malignant, slow-growing tumors with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Tumor metastases of this slow-growing malignant tumor to other organs are relatively infrequent, but can be detected in the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, or bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In this case, there were no symptoms, and the tumor was detected by chance in a chest CT. Present day imaging techniques such as abdominal ultrasonography, echocardiography, CT, and MRI are commonly employed to make a rapid and precise diagnosis of a suspected leiomyosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case we could not preoperatively diagnose the tumor as leiomyosarcoma of the IVC and also could not rule out a potential liver tumor. A final conclusive diagnosis is of course made by means of histopathological and immunohistochemical methods. The pathognomonic findings of leiomyosarcoma are spindle-shaped tumor cells with positive markers for smooth muscle cells, vimentin, muscle actin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and desmin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The recommended therapy for treating leiomyosarcoma is aggressive surgical removal of the tumor by means of modern vascular surgery, in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8, 10\\]</u>. In surgery, a complete resection of the tumor was possible, and the IVC was repaired primarily via surgical means without too high a risk of postoperative edema. For leiomyosarcomas, there is a perioperative mortality of 4%, and 42% of the patients died of the disease itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. To reduce the tumor size and increase the resection rate, a preoperative neoadjuvant therapy can be implemented. If, however, a complete tumor resection is not possible, tumor reduction followed by radiation therapy provides a good palliative treatment option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Postoperative therapy and the management of recurrence are difficult because of the absence of evidence for their effectiveness in patients. Radiation has been used in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, and some authors believe that it may help with the local control of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. For localized, resectable, soft-tissue sarcomas, adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin or a combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide has been shown to prolong the time before recurrence and the overall rate of survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This therapy may thus also be effective in the treatment of IVC leiomyosarcoma. A case has been previously reported in which an IVC leiomyosarcoma with liver metastasis was positive for steroid receptors, including the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The patient received combined multimodal therapy, including resection of the tumor, intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy, and hormonal manipulation. Thus hormonal manipulation using medroxyprogesterone and/or tamoxifen should be tried in ER/PR-positive cases. Although there is no established treatment for patients with IVC leiomyosarcoma, we hope that thorough investigation of this condition will help establish a standard treatment yielding satisfactory results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In a series of case studies of 14 patients with a leiomyosarcoma of the IVC who underwent generous resection followed by radiation, it was established that radiotherapy reduced local recurrence and increased the median survival time. In addition, a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been reported as being superior to radiotherapy alone with respect to an increase in the survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The long-term outcome of surgery for leiomyosarcoma of the IVC has been disappointing. Some reports with sufficient case numbers and followup revealed that a 5-year survival rate was achieved 33%–53% after radical resection followed by a curative approach using adjuvant therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8, 13\\]</u>. We should diagnose this tumor in early stage, and aggressive surgical management using modern vascular surgical and oncology techniques.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】We encountered a rare case of leiomyosarcoma of the IVC mimicking a liver tumor. We must always consider leiomyosarcoma when treating a tumor between the liver and the IVC and be prepared to perform a complete surgical resection in the event of leiomyosarcoma and follow up carefully. We must also consider adjuvant therapy for a recurrent leiomyosarcoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:54:16", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:55:24", "cost": 68.046}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:55:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:54:15"}

Because the pathophysiology of stroke is dynamic, it is often hard to identify the cause of stroke. Here, we present the case of a 75-year-old man with ischemic stroke following angina pectoris caused by severe anemia and localized peritonitis due to gastrointestinal stromal tumor of small intestine. On admission, he showed consciousness disturbance, fever, and left hemiplegia. The electrocardiogram on admission showed ST-segment depression in V2 to V6 which was normalized 4 hours later. The ultrasound cardiogram showed the mild hypokinesis in the apical portion of left ventricle which was also normalized later. The magnetic resonance imaging and angiography showed ischemic stroke in watershed area between right anterior and middle cerebral arteries area and stenosis of distal portion of right middle cerebral artery. The computed tomography of abdomen showed a mass of small intestine. We decided to perform curative surgery after transfusion and successfully resected the mass of the small intestine, which was revealed to be a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). This is a successfully treated case of GIST in which the complicated pathophysiology of watershed cerebral infarction following angina pectoris might be clearly revealed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Though it is not common, ischemic stroke followed by an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is well known to be a serious complication. In general, several cardiac disorders, such as atrial fibrillation, mitral valve disease, and AMI, are thought to be the frequent cause of ischemic stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, the underlying mechanism of ischemic stroke in conjunction with heart disease is often hard to identify.\n\n【4】Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are defined as stromal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, with a spindle cell, epithelioid, or occasionally pleomorphic morphology, which are potentially malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The predominant localization for GISTs is the stomach (60%) and small intestine (20–30%). The incidence is estimated to be approximately 1–1.5 per 100,000 per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Many GISTs grow asymptomatically until they are identified clinically because of abdominal pain (35–40%), gastrointestinal bleeding (15–25%) and subsequent anemia (15–30%), mass pressure effects, or perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】In this case, we present a man with a GIST and potential right middle cerebral artery stenosis, who suffered a watershed cerebral infarction following angina pectoris during sleep. We hypothesize that severe anemia caused by the bleeding from the intestine and the localized peritonitis caused by the GIST triggered an insufficient oxygen supply to myocardium. Because the man showed no cardiac symptoms after transfusion and more than 4 metabolic equivalents (METs) on a treadmill test, he underwent radical resection of the GIST. This appears to be a successfully treated case of GIST in which the complicated pathophysiology of watershed cerebral infarction following angina pectoris might be clearly revealed.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 75-year-old man with general fatigue 6 months prior to admission showed chest discomfort followed by disturbances in consciousness and was transferred to our ambulance center. He had a past history of hypertension and had been taking antihypertensive drug until admission. His only coronary heart risk factor was hypertension. On admission, he showed consciousness disturbance (E1V3M5: Glasgow coma scale) and left hemiplegia. His blood pressure was 103/64 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats/min, and body temperature 39.0°C. His blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 0<sup>3</sup>/μL, a hemoglobin level of 5.0 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 17.6%, a platelet level of 0<sup>3</sup>/μL, troponin T positivity, a creatine kinase level of 60 U/L, a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 98 mg/dL, a triglyceride level of 66 mg/dL, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 7.87 mg/dL. The electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed complete right bundle branch block and ST-segment depression in II, III, aVF, and V2 to V6. ST-segment depression had normalized in ECG redone 4 hours later . The ultrasound cardiogram (UCG) showed an ejection fraction of 60% and mild hypokinesis in the apical portion of the left ventricle which had also normalized in a UCG repeated on the 8th day of admission. Magnetic resonance imaging showed cerebral infarction of the watershed area between right anterior and middle cerebral arteries. A magnetic resonance angiography showed stenosis of the distal portion of right middle cerebral artery . Computed tomography (CT) showed a mass in the small intestine with heterogeneous enhancement, surrounded by mesenteric fat with hyperdensity indicating localized peritonitis .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed complete right bundle branch block and ST-segment depression in II, III, aVF, and V2 to V6 on admission.

He was transfused with 4 units (equivalent to 800 mL of total blood) of red blood cell concentration to treat the severe anemia and the hemoglobin levels and hematocrit were 8.2 g/dL and 28.1%, respectively, on the 6th day of admission. After the transfusion, the patient was given an iron preparation until the surgery on the 21st day of admission. The hemoglobin levels and hematocrit increased to 9.9 g/dL and 32.0%, respectively, on the 20th day of admission. The cerebral infarction was treated using glycerol and edaravone without antiplatelets without antiplatelet therapy because of the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The patient was also treated using antibiotics because of the high fever and hyper-CRPemia, which might have been caused by the localized peritonitis around the intestinal tumor. Body temperature was normalized on the 3rd day of admission and CRP levels reduced to 0.67 mg/dL on the 8th day of admission.\n\n【12】After his functional capacity was evaluated by a cardiologist, the patient demonstrated more than 4 METs on a treadmill test. On the 21st day of admission, a curative resection was performed. The tumor was located 25 cm from terminal ileum on the oral side, and it penetrated to the retroperitoneum and caused localized peritonitis. Part of the ileum had adhered to the retroperitoneum because of the inflammation, though this could be detached manually. The tumor size was 60 × 58 × 55 mm . A pathological analysis showed that the tumor was composed of spindle cells with fascicles and whorls which is typical for GISTs. The left hemiplegia gradually disappeared and the patient was discharged from the hospital without complications on the 35th day of admission. The patient was going to be readmitted to a heart center and undergo coronary angiography to evaluate the risk for angina pectoris. The clinical course of the patient is summarized in a scheme .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Clinical course.</u>\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】On admission, it was difficult to diagnose the pathophysiology of this patient. In this patient, the medical history showed consciousness disturbance and left hemiplegia following chest discomfort, which meant that angina pectoris occurred prior to cerebral infarction. We also found the transient ST-segment depression in II, III, aVF, and V2 to V6 through an ECG on admission that disappeared within a few hours. Anemia is a risk factor for ischemic heart disease and a lower level of hemoglobin is associated with its severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Fever and severe anemia might increase oxygen consumption of the myocardium and provoke the development of angina pectoris . In general, ST-segment elevation provides information on where a lesion is located, and ST-segment depression recorded by the precordial lead does not specify the location of a lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In this case, because the apical portion of the left ventricle showed mild hypokinesis, the distal portion of the anterior descending branch might be the culprit artery. The patient was required to undergo a coronary angiography to specify culprit artery for angina pectoris; however, coronary stent implantation required the patient to take dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent stent thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In addition, the patient demonstrated no cardiac symptoms after admission and more than 4 METs on a treadmill test, so we hypothesized that the main cause of the angina pectoris was the severe anemia and the localized peritonitis. Generally, it is not useful to perform further cardiac imaging for patients with moderate to good functional capacity (≥4 METs) in the perioperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Then, we decided to perform curative resection of the GIST that had caused intestinal hemorrhage first. Antiplatelet therapy was initiated soon after the surgery was successfully performed. The balance between antithrombotic therapy and treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is challenging. In one case, a patient with myocardial infarction began dual antiplatelet therapy and showed active bleeding from colon cancer. Though a stent was placed in his right coronary artery, it was occluded after the dual antiplatelet therapy was discontinued for the abdominal surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. His partial colonic resection was successfully performed. However, it is often hard to construct a treatment strategy for such complex cases.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Scheme of the possible pathophysiology in this case.</u>\n\n【17】Although GISTs are a rare type of cancer, they are the most common sarcoma in the gastrointestinal tract. Surgery remains the only modality that can offer a permanent cure of GISTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Trousseau’s syndrome is a well-known cancer-associated thrombosis that was first described in 1865 by Armand Trousseau 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, a direct link between GISTs and thrombosis has not been previously reported.\n\n【18】In this case, the stenosis of the distal portion of the right middle cerebral artery would be the culprit lesion of the watershed cerebral infarction. At present, clinical studies have not shown that the stent implantation for intracranial arterial stenosis is beneficial for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Recently, in the Stenting Versus Aggressive Medical Therapy for Intracranial Arterial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) trial, 451 patients with recent transient ischemic attack or stroke related to 70–99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery were randomly assigned to aggressive medical management or aggressive medical management plus stenting using the Wingspan stent. As a result, during a median follow-up of months, 34 (15%) of 227 patients in the medical management group and 52 (23%) of 224 patients in the stenting group had died or had a stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This study tells us that patients should be carefully selected for intracranial artery stenosis stenting until an improved device for stenting exists.\n\n【19】Overall, the severe anemia (hemoglobin 5.0 g/dL) and localized peritonitis of the patient in the current report could have been the main trigger for his angina pectoris because he had no cardiac symptoms, demonstrated more than 4 METs on a treadmill after transfusion, and underwent curative surgery for a GIST without complications. However, the patient suffered hypertension, which is a coronary risk factor, and so an assessment of coronary stenosis was appropriate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 16:52:33", "endTime": "2024/09/23 16:52:42", "cost": 8.328}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 00:52:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 00:52:33"}

The laboratory analysis showed moderate hypoosmolar hyponatremia (Na: 132 mmol/L, osmolality: 239 mOsm/L), normal sodium excretion (<20 mmol/L), and a high urinary osmolality (415 mOsm/L). Later, she deteriorated with seizures and deeper hyponatremia (Na: 113 mmol/L) and so was moved to the critical care unit. At first, no obvious aetiology was found, the patient was euvolemic, as she was well hydrated and lacked concerning findings of heart failure, renal disease, or liver cirrhosis. A syndrome of inappropriate diuresis (SIAD) was proposed, and corrective measures were started immediately to reduce her hyponatremia, including restriction of fluid intake. The administration of intravenous hypertonic saline solution permitted normal neurological status to be restored and corrected the sodium concentration but induced reversible acute renal failure. Further investigation revealed that the patient had ingested 8 g ibuprofen two days before admission. After other aetiologies were ruled out, drug-induced SIAD due to ibuprofen was the most likely diagnosis for this patient. SIAD-associated hyponatremia and acute renal failure are rare side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly in young people. Therefore, this case may represent a unique case of NSAID-induced SIAD and highlight the need to obtain thorough medication histories and exclude all other potential causes in hyponatremic patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The syndrome of inappropriate diuresis (SIAD) is the most common disorder of sodium and water balance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and must be distinguished from several other types of hyponatremia because each requires different management. The most common causes are increased hypothalamic production of ADH, due to neuropsychiatric disorders, drugs, pulmonary diseases, HIV infection, or ectopic production of ADH which occurs in carcinoma, lymphosarcoma, or leukaemia.\n\n【4】Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug used to treat moderate pain and/or fever. The recommended dose varies with body mass and indication. A dose of 400 mg to 1200 mg per day (i.e. 17 to 36 mg/kg) is considered the maximum amount for over-the-counter use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite a very wide use, ibuprofen is rarely associated with severe toxicity. Drugs as NSAIDs cause SIAD by enhancing the action of ADH at the renal tubule level. However, the proportion of drug-induced SIAD resulting from NSAID is less than 0.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. An idiopathic form of the syndrome has been reported, but poorly documented. Also, 5% of SIAD is thought to be idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and is a discrete category of SIAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Maybe a proportion of these are actually ibuprofen induced. In the USA, from 1988 to 1990, 50 614 intoxications with NSAIDs were described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, predominantly with ibuprofen. 131 patients (0.26%) had major outcomes with 10 deaths (drug overdose). In Great Britain in 2003, enquiries about the management of patients possibly suffering from ibuprofen overdose account for over 5% of the total enquiries received by the London Centre of the UK National Poisons Information Service. In each of the 1033 cases, there were complicating factors related to other drugs and/or other diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Regarding the cases described in the literature, elderly and comorbid patients develop drug-induced SIAD more than young people. We report a rare case of a 30-year-old healthy and euvolemic woman who developed severe hyponatremia and acute renal failure after absorption of 152 mg/kg ibuprofen. After a thorough investigation and exclusion of more common causes, SAID was thought to be drug induced.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 30-year-old woman was admitted to the infectious diseases unit for fever and nausea (without vomiting) evolving over 5 days and resistant to analgesic and antipyretic drugs (acetaminophen). She was not anorexic, had no significant past medical history, under no medication, and she denied any medical or toxic ingestions. Temperature was 37°C, pulse rate was 100 b/min, and blood pressure was 150/70 mmHg. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormality, and EKG and chest X-ray were normal. Laboratory analysis only showed a mild biological inflammation (c-reactive protein: 8 mg/L) and a moderate hyponatremia (132 mmol/L). The results for the remaining biological tests were in the normal range (potassium: 3.8 mmol/L, chlorine: 96 mmol/L, urea: 2.8 mmol/L, and creatinine: 55 mmol/L). Urinalysis showed no abnormality and additional urine toxicological testing exclude drugs abuse. The next day, she complained of nausea, headache, and diffuse pain evocative of meningism.\n\n【7】The cerebrospinal fluid was acellular without biochemical abnormality. A brain MRI excluded an intracranial bleed or other focal abnormality, whereas an EEG showed signs of encephalopathy. Biochemistry tests were within normal limits, except serum sodium levels (113 mmol/L) and osmolality (239 mOsm/L). Natriuresis and urinary osmolality were preserved (137 mmol/L and 415 mOsm/L, resp.). On day 2, despite normal saline perfusion (2 litres in 24 hours) and presumptive antiinfective treatments (amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and aciclovir), the patient convulsed and was transferred to intensive care unit. Her natremia fell to 105 mmol/L on day 3 (osmolality: 231 mOsml/L). Cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels were normal (random cortisol and ACTH stimulation test); aldosterone levels were 3 times higher than normal and vasopressin (ADH) was within normal limits (2.39 pg/mL). Fluid restriction was undertaken and sodium levels reached 124 mmol/L in 24 hours. While neurological disorders were improving, acute renal failure occurred (creatinine levels rose from 36 to 259 μmol/L, BUN rose to 6.9 mmol/L), so fluid restriction was stopped. On day 6, the patient was apyretic and renal function was restored with natremia reaching 132 mmol/L. Several aetiologies were ruled out (viral, bacterial, and toxic, including heavy metals), and there was no evidence of psychogenic polydypsia (nursing staff did not report any excessive drinking). She had no known cause of antidiuresis. There was no argument for hypervolemia (congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis), hypovolemia (haemorrhage, gastroenteritis, or diuretic abuse), renal failure, or adrenal failure. Thyroid function tests and chest radiography gave normal results. Neuropsychiatry disorders were excluded, as well as pulmonary diseases (tuberculosis or lung abscess), HIV infection, meningitis, encephalitis, and ectopic production of ADH (carcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease …). Further investigations led to the discovery that the patient had ingested more than 20 tablets of ibuprofen 400 mg (representing 152 mg/kg) for back pain in the two days before admission to hospital. The outcome was favourable and the patient left hospital 12 days later.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Hyponatremia is a common disorder, usually more prevalent in older adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. SIAD is the most common form of normovolaemic or dilutional hyponatremia. The diagnosis of SIAD is based on five criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>: hypotonic hyponatremia (natremia < 135 mmol/L), persistent urinary sodium excretion (>30 mmol/L), plasmatic osmolality < 280 mOsmol/L, urine osmolality in excess of plasma osmolality, absence of oedema, or volume depletion, and normal renal, adrenal, or thyroid function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Clinical features are nonspecific, mainly neurological, and can threaten life. The severity of symptoms is related to both the absolute serum sodium concentration and its rapid decrease, particularly if greater than 0.5 mmol/L/h, which most likely explains the seizure activity in our patient. The management of SIAD patients may include efficient treatment of the primitive disease and removal of excess total body water. Fluid restriction remains the safe mainstay of hyponatremia management, as applied to our patient. Unfortunately, a convulsive episode associated with severe hyponatremia (113 mmol/L) occurred, requiring its rapid correction, as recommended by most guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Inappropriate antidiuresis is usually due to the administration or endogeneous production of ADH, causing renal water reabsorption and resulting in hyponatremia with increasing extracellular fluid volume. Endogenous production can be either eutopic or ectopic, induced by a wide variety of diseases (cancers, neurological disorders, and lung diseases), drugs, or injuries . Whereas some drugs are implied in ADH stimulation (carbamazepine and vincristine), other drugs (NSAIDs and chlorpropamide) enhance its action at the renal tubule level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> or play a role in prostaglandin inhibition (such as ibuprofen). For the reported patient, we ruled out many causes of SIAD after analysis of her history, physical examination, and initial medical record. Ibuprofen-induced SIAD was the most likely diagnosis despite her young age. NSAIDs can adversely affect the kidney because they can induce sodium retention and antagonize the action of diuretics, impair free-water clearance, and cause hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Similar cases have been described in the past, but the patients suffered from chronic diseases such as advanced chronic renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, von Willebrand’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>, or were extremely old (>80 y) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Most common causes of SIADH.</u>\n\n【12】Whereas over-the-counter antipyretics and/or analgesics are relatively safe for adults, cyclooxygenase inhibitors may induce a wide variety of side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, which usually concern elderly patients or are found in critical situations such as hypovolemia or anesthesia. Except for newborns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>, acute renal failure is rarely described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>, but the low report of cases is probably underestimated since renal failure is often moderate and diuresis preserved. The Naranjo criteria classify the probability that an adverse event is related to drug therapy based on a list of weighted questions, which examine factors such as the temporal association of drug administration and event occurrence, alternative causes for the event, drug levels, dose-response relationships, and previous patient experience with the medication. In our case report, the score was five, so the adverse drug reaction was classified as probable. But the Naranjo criteria do not take into account drug-drug interactions. Moreover, other causes as back pain, an undiagnosed viral infection, are also plausible explanations of what happened.\n\n【13】This case stresses the importance in asking about history specifically pertaining to analgesics as commonly patients may not be open about the use of these medications because they are over-the-counter, easily accessible and viewed to be benign ingestions by the general public.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】This clinical case stresses the importance that clinicians should give to recognising NSAIDs as a potential cause for patients who present with SIAD, even where there are no risk factors such as extreme age or renal failure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:57:42", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:57:58", "cost": 15.309}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:57:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:57:42"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Dengue is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It is an endemic virus in tropical countries. In Colombia, 4 serotypes are present (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4) and the disease is a burden for public health, social programs, and the economic sector. It is transmitted in two ways: the vertical one (from mother to child) and the vector through the bite of infected mosquitoes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, and it has also been reported during transfusion of blood components and organ transplant. The main vector is Aedes aegypti, although transmission through the Aedes albopictus mosquito is also described in the literature, which has a lower transmission capacity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, and most infections are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. The hemorrhagic appearances of severe dengue are due to plasma leakage as a result of increased vascular permeability, severe thrombopenia, and hemoconcentration.\n\n【4】In 2020, 78,979 cases of dengue were reported in Colombia. 38,836 (49.2%) of them reported warning-free signs, 39,246 (49.7%) with warning signs, and 897 (1.1%) of severe dengue. Dengue incidence in Colombia on a regional basis is 295.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants at risk. For Huila, incidence rates higher than 500 cases per 100,000 inhabitants are estimated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Dengue is a disease that has a wide spectrum of signs affecting different organs and systems; sometimes, special therapies are required to maintain the proper functioning of the different affected organs. Among the main cardiovascular complications of dengue, it is the dengue shock, which is considered as the clearest way of plasma leakage and the main cause of the potential fatal outcome of the disease. This is an acute state of cardiovascular dysfunction leading to an inability to carry enough amounts of oxygen and nutrients to meet metabolic needs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. As it is well-known, viral diseases are immune system activators, triggering off a loss of tolerance in it. Dengue is not an exception, and it is able to explain different autoimmune phenomena including macrophage activation.

Clinical Case\n\n【9】A 6-year-old male patient (weight: 19 kg, SD: −0.70; height 113 cm, SD: −0.56; BMI: 14.9 SD: −0.41) with no significant medical history, coming from the first level of care with clinical manifestation of 5-day evolution, consistent nonquantified fever, asthenia, adynamia, myalgia, arthralgia, emetic episodes, abdominal pain, and headache. The patient was hospitalized with a probable dengue diagnosis with warning signs. He shows a torpid clinical course, with epistaxis, progressive thrombopenia, dengue hepatitis, oligoanuria, 20% right pleural effusion, fever persistence, and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient was taken to the pediatric ICU due to his proven severe dengue diagnosis. In follow-up tests, positive IgM serology for dengue, hematological affection was documented due to bicytopenia (anemia and thrombopenia) without evidence of external or hidden bleeding  requiring platelet transfusion on two occasions; it was decided to transfuse because the patient had already overcome the dengue critical phase, and this decrease was progressive until high-bleeding risk values from vital organ are associated with severe hemodynamic affection, secondary to Evans syndrome and not to a hematological manifestation of dengue.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Platelet and hemoglobin behavior of the patient with severe dengue and Evans syndrome.Hemoglobin levels are shown in area form, and their values appear on the left axis Platelet levels are shown as a line, and their values are shown on the right-hand axis.</u>\n\n【11】Given the atypical course of the disease, an interdisciplinary approach was used on the part of the pediatric subspecialties of infectious diseases, hemato-oncology, and rheumatology. Studies were prolonged including autoimmunity profile, bone marrow aspiration, and biopsy (findings: nonnecrotizing epithelioid granuloma), polycultures (negative blood cultures 1 and 2, negative urine culture, and negative myeloid culture), negative infectious profile (IgM and IgG serologies for negative Toxoplasma gondii; negative cytomegalovirus; negative Epstein–Barr; negative hepatitis A, B, and C studies; nonreactive HIV ELISA; and nonreactive VDRL), and biomarkers (positive Coombs test). The patient was considered to have Evans syndrome, and treatment with immunoglobulin was suggested, 2 g/kg/total dose, with a partial response and subsequently a steroid cycle with prednisolone, a dose of 1 mg/kg/day initially with programmed titration until suspended. Outpatient follow-up was carried out for 6 months after discharge, and the patient was discharged due to pediatric hemato-oncology and rheumatology. Clinical improvement was documented with supervision of the described condition without relapse on cytopenia and nonadministration of the oral steroid.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】The first description of Evans syndrome was made in 1951 by Robert Evans, who studied 24 patients with ages between 3 and 78 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. This disease consists of the combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombopenia and less usual, immune neutropenia (between 15 and 55%) and can be classified as primary or secondary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–14\\]</u>. Its etiology is unknown and among the possible causes it is the dysregulation of the immune system which leads to the production of IL-10 and interferon gamma, leading to activation of Autoreactive T Lymphocytes and production of autoantibodies by B lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 13, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【14】In the literature review, reports of dengue hemolytic anemia cases are considered to be of low prevalence. These reports are about adult patients. In the description by Aye et al. it is reported a male patient who develops hemolytic anemia during the dengue recovery phase. This finding could be related to the severity of the disease and this etiological agent should be taken into account as a cause of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, so much that it is compared with Mycoplasma pneumoniae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The case report by Kulkarni and Sharma describes a 52-year-old patient with Dengue and warning signs. Hemolytic anemia is subsequently documented with a positive Coombs test. In general, patients with dengue have anemia due to viral medullary aplasia and documented bleedings; having hemolytic anemia is considered an atypical manifestation of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Although the diagnostic criteria are clearly described, underreporting may take place in relation to the number of cases diagnosed and published since, in some situations, the direct Coomb's test may be negative. One reason is because in some commercial antiglobulin reagents, the IgG sensitization is below the detection threshold. Another cause is that if the optimal conditions are not found in the analytical phase, for example, if the preparatory wash is not carried out at 4°C or with a low ionic strength, the elimination of the low affinity IgG can be generated. As a third cause, sensitization of red blood cells with just one IgA or with low molecular weight (monomeric) IgM, not accompanied by complement fixation, may result in a negative test since a large variety of commercial antiglobulin reagents have only anti-IgG and anti-C3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Nowadays, treatment is based on immunomodulatory therapy schemes depending on the clinical conditions of the patient and comorbidities. The first line of treatment includes oral corticosteroids at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day and IV immunoglobulin at a dose of 2 g/kg/total dose; both options were used in this case for the management of cytopenia secondary to Evans syndrome. In severe cases, the use of steroids is recommended at initial doses of 4–6 mg/kg/day during the first 72 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Although transfusions are not recommended due to the risk of exacerbation, they are only prescribed in cases of severe hemodynamic affection and risk of vital organ affection, as it is evidenced in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The second line of management is the immunosuppressive drugs: azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, ofetil, vincristine, danazol, sirolimus, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab or surgical management with splenectomy, especially in patients with frequent relapses or in those who receive high doses of corticosteroid aimed at reducing doses and minimize their side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 14, 15\\]</u>. In severe and refractory cases, hematopoietic stem cell transplant is considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In the multicenter study published by the French group led by Aladjidi, conducted at the Bordeaux University Hospital, 156 patients were analyzed in 26 clinics during the period from 1981 to 2014. Given the characteristics of this cohort and the disease severity, azathioprine and rituximab were used as a second line of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】About 50% of Evans syndrome cases are associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous, lymphoproliferative diseases, and common variable immunodeficiency, with a higher prevalence in the pediatric population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Some immune deficiencies can occur with autoimmune manifestations without active infections; cases with immunological alterations have been documented in controls after the first-line management (steroids or immunoglobulin), proving the diagnosis of mainly humoral immunodeficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【19】When faced with an endemic tropical disease in many regions with a wide spectrum of clinical and paraclinical manifestations and with a wide range of severe complications, we think it is important to identify unusual clinical patterns that require timely interventions to avoid definitive secondary injuries or fatal outcome. Until the date of completion of this paper, no case was found in the most important international, regional, and local databases describing the association between both diseases in pediatric patients; therefore, we consider this to be the first case reporting an association between dengue disease and Evans syndrome in a child.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:53:34", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:54:02", "cost": 28.087}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:54:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:53:34"}

Kikuchi–Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare, benign, and self-limiting disease that is commonly associated with cervical lymphadenopathy and fever. The disease has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, and definitive diagnosis is based on the histological appearance in the excision biopsy of the lymph nodes. Recurrence of KFD is reported rarely. Case Presentation. A 56-year-old Iranian woman with a background history of thrombocytopenia presented with fever, malaise, loss of appetite, and weight loss with cervical lymphadenopathy. The excision biopsy of the cervical lymph nodes confirmed the diagnosis of KFD, and she made a full recovery with improvement of symptoms, regression of cervical lymph nodes, and normalization inflammatory markers. One year after remission, she presented with similar clinico-biochemical profile, and repeat biopsy confirmed KFD. Conclusion. Although the rate of recurrence of the disease is very low, the treating physician should consider the possibility and confirm it histologically.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Kikuchi necrotizing lymphadenitis is a rare, benign, and self-limiting disease that is commonly associated with cervical lymphadenopathy and fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Many reports suggest a possible link to a variety of microorganisms, from bacteria to viruses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. KFD is generally reported more common in women than men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. The average age of people involved is less than 40 years and is more common in young people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Skin rash, arthritis, fatigue, and hepatosplenomegaly are reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.The definitive diagnosis of this disease is made by excisional biopsy of the cervical lymph nodes and is based on histopathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, it is possible to approach the diagnosis in special cases with a skilled radiologist with specific computed tomography appearance of the involved lymph node groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Most cases of KFD are self-limiting, but some cases are treated with steroids, NSAIDs, and immunoglobulins with variable success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–13\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The recurrence rate of the disease is rare and is about 3–4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In a case of recurrent symptoms with lymphadenopathy, possibility of recurrence of KFD needs to be considered and actively excluded histologically as other sinister possibilities include infections or malignancy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 56-year-old Iranian woman presented with a one-month history of low-grade fever with generalized malaise, loss of weight, and loss of appetite, and she had noticed swelling of neck glands for the similar duration. She denied any joint pains, increased hair loss, or oral ulcers. She did not have chronic cough, sore throat, or ear discharge. The patient denied any alteration of bowel habits or melena. She denied any past history and contact history of tuberculosis or any high-risk sex behaviours. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia. One month prior to this presentation, she was seen by a rheumatologist with inflammatory bilateral knee joint arthritis. Her investigations were significant for thrombocytopenia of 109 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (150–400 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). There was no involvement of other cell lines. In the workup for the ANA, rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP were negative.\n\n【7】On examination, she was febrile. She was neither pale nor icteric. She had firm, tender discrete lymphadenopathy, the largest measuring 2 cm, in the right upper cervical region. Respiratory and cardiovascular system examinations were normal. Abdominal examination was normal without evidence of organomegaly.\n\n【8】Neck ultrasonography revealed multiple cervical lymph nodes in the cervical region, the largest of which was 24 mm in size in the right submandibular, as well as numerous lymphadenopathies were seen in the right axillary region. Her blood investigations are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 The results of laboratory tests of the patient before the biopsy.</u>\n\n【10】The patient was treated with a course of oral antibiotics considering the possibility of bacterial lymphadenopathy (co-amoxiclav and metronidazole). No improvement in symptomatology was observed over 7-day course of antibiotics, and in addition, she was noted to have a generalized urticarial skin rash.\n\n【11】She underwent excision biopsy of the cervical lymph node. Histopathology revealed areas of necrosis, infiltrated with nuclear dust, paucity of granulocytes, and surrounding tissue showing mononuclear cells and reported as “benign acute necrotizing lymphadenitis” which was compatible with Kikuchi’s disease. She made an uneventful recovery with normalization of hematological and biochemical parameters without a specific treatment over a period of few weeks.\n\n【12】One year later, she was seen in the hospital with low-grade fever, malaise, loss of appetite, and loss of weight with cervical lymphadenopathy, and repeat biopsy of the cervical lymph nodes revealed similar histopathology compatible with Kikuchi’s disease. She was managed conservatively, and the patient made a full recovery. Currently, she is asymptomatic and under follow-up.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Kikuchi’s disease is a benign condition which is more common among young females of tropics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. It is mostly a self-limiting condition of lymphadenopathy mainly involving the cervical group of lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. It can be associated with other constitutional symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, and loss of weight. Diagnosis of Kikuchi’s disease is mainly based on the histological assessment of excised lymph node by an experienced histopathologist. Histological features in favor of Kikuchi’s disease include fragmentation, necrosis, and karyorrhexis with paucity of granulocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. But it could be frequently misdiagnosed as a malignant lymphoma. Three histopathological types of Kikuch’s disease are described which include proliferative, necrotizing, and xanthomatous type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Differential diagnosis of cervical lymphadenopathy is broad and exhausting which includes infections (infectious mononucleosis, cat scratch fever, toxoplasmosis, and tuberculosis), inflammatory conditions (SLE), or malignancies (lymphoma or metastatic) to name a few. So, the diagnosis of Kikuchi’s disease should be made very cautiously after careful exclusion of these causes including the sinister ones. Kikuchi’s disease can be a great masquerader of lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Recurrence of lymphadenopathy in Kikuchi’s disease is unusual. A study by Cheng et al. reported 14 patients (n = 195) having clinical recurrence after 6-month period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. But other studies report a lower incidence of recurrence of KFD after the 1<sup>st</sup> episode which is estimated around 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Blewitt reported a recurrence of Kikuchi’s disease after 12 years following the initial episode 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Another interesting case study of a patient reports 4 relapses within a period of 18 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. We report a confirmed case of Kikuchi’s disease relapsing after one month of complete remission of symptoms and regression of lymph nodes. As the recurrence is rare in Kikuchi’s disease, it is very prudent to exclude other sinister causes of lymphadenopathy in the later presentation. So, repeat biopsy and histological assessment is of utmost importance before labeling the patient with a recurrence of Kikuchi’s disease. The etiopathogenesis of rare but reported recurrences in KFD disease is still to be elucidated, but we believe that underlying autoimmunity is responsible for the recurrent hits in KFD in susceptible individuals, and further studies are indeed warranted to hunt for a genetic or environmental trigger in this group.\n\n【17】Another interesting finding in this case report is the long-standing thrombocytopenia of around 100 × 10<sup>6</sup>/L platelets. She had been extensively investigated for her thrombocytopenia including ANA, RF, and anti-CCP, and no cause was found. But immune thrombocytopenia could be a part of an autoimmune spectrum disorders such as SLE which could evolve in the future. Santana et al. described that Kikuchi’s disease patients are at increased risk of developing SLE at a later time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【18】During the two episodes of Kikuchi’s disease, we observed that patient’s platelet count increased to nadir of 150 × 10<sup>6/</sup>L. We believe the most likely explanation for this is thrombopoietin is an acute-phase reactant, and thrombocytosis is commonly observed in acute inflammatory conditions. It is further supported in our patient by the elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevation of the ferritin level.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】Recurrence of Kikuchi’s disease is rare. It is prudent to confirm the recurrence histologically in diagnosis of relapsing Kikuchi’s disease as it can masquerade other sinister diagnoses such as lymphoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:44", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:16:10", "cost": 925.857}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:16:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:42"}

Obsessive-compulsive symptom due to brain lesions is not rare, but suppression of these symptoms after head trauma is very rare and we found only 3 cases in review of literatures from 1966 to 2001. The case of a patient suffering with severe OCD is described of note; her symptoms disappeared following right temporo-parietofrontal lesion.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The cardinal manifestations of OCD are recurrent intrusive, ego-dystonic thoughts, images, and urges portending adverse consequences leading to feelings of anxious dread, patients therefore engage in mental and motor compulsions (repetitive ritualized thoughts or acts) in an attempt to neutralize the obsession/adverse consequence. The obsessions or compulsions are time consuming and interfere significantly with the person’s normal routine, occupational functioning, usual social activities, or relationship 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】##### 1.1. Brain-Imaging Studies\n\n【5】Neuroimaging in OCD patients has produced converging data implicating altered function in the neurocircuitry between orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, and thalamus. Various functional brain-imaging studies—for example, positron emission tomography (PET)—have shown increased activity (e.g. metabolism and blood flow) in the frontal lobes, the basal ganglia (especially the caudate), and the cingulum of patients with OCD. The involvement of these areas in the pathways with the amygdale pathway that are the current focus of anxiety disorder research. Pharmacological and behavioral treatments reportedly reverse these abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】In a normal subject, the orbitofrontal cortex would stimulate the caudate, which, in turn, would stimulate the pallid nucleus, consequently inhibiting the medial thalamic nucleus, the main station to the frontal cortex. The medial thalamic nucleus would modulate and correct the hyperactivity of orbitofrontal thalamic stations. Dysfunctions in the modulatory activity of these interconnections may possibly be present in patients with OCD and hyperactivity of the thalamic-orbitofrontal interconnection may produce obsessive thoughts and compulsive rituals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【7】According to this scheme striatal dysfunction leads to inefficient thalamic gating, resulting in hyperactivity within the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex. This could result in the intrusive cognitive phenomena and the associated anxiety. Extending this of thought, compulsions could be conceptualized as repetitive mental and motor behaviors, performed to recruit the striatum so as to ultimately achieve thalamic gating transiently neutralizing the anxiety and thoughts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【8】The most common psychosurgical procedure for OCD is cingulotomy, which is successful in treating 25 to 30 percent of otherwise treatment-unresponsive patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【10】The patient was a 44-year-old female, who has suffered from contamination and pathological doubt obsessions and washing and checking compulsions from adolescence. The score of Yale-Brown scale was thirty. The disorder had deteriorated her social and interpersonal relations, but prior to this accident, she did not take any treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder. In a car accident, a temporoparietal hemorrhage occurred, and she was in coma state for 3 months. After this period, her symptoms disappeared. The score of Yale-Brown scale has been zero yet. MRI images of the brain were performed few days of initial episode of injury showed a temporoparietal hemorrhagic contusion. In followup, after 9 years, MRI showed focal atrophy of the temporal lobe with associated dilatation of the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle . There are multiple foci of high signal intensity within the subcortical and deep cerebral white matter in the parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes. The patient has not any cognition problem, and minimental state score is thirty now.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Axial FLAIR image. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Studies that investigate the pathophysiology of OCD are therefore of considerable importance, because they may ultimately inform treatment strategies. Functional brain imaging in obsessive-compulsive disorder demonstrated decreased blood flow in the temporal lobes as well as cortical perfusion abnormalities in the frontal lobes abnormal blood flow may be seen in a number of different brain regions in acquired OCD. It is unclear whether these changes reflect primary neurological lesions or secondary changes to compensate for such damage. However, increased frontal blood flow in OCD may be hypothesized to reflect a compensatory mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Neuroimaging studies consistently associated dysfunction with prefrontal cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) pathways in obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. According to this scheme striatal dysfunction leads to inefficient thalamic gating, resulting in hyperactivity within the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex. This could result in the intrusive cognitive phenomena and the associated anxiety. Extending this of thought, compulsions could be conceptualized as repetitive mental and motor behaviors, performed to recruit the striatum so as to ultimately achieve thalamic gating transiently neutralizing the anxiety and thoughts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It is noteworthy that the orbitofrontal cortex might play a potential role in inhibitory motor control. This may be of special importance given the compulsions presented in OCD and the patients; attempts to resist performing these actions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our review of Medline from 1966 to 2001 showed that our patient is the 4th case of OCD whose symptoms significantly disappeared following head trauma. One is a patient with severe obsessive illness who sustained a severe head injury. As a consequence of his injury, the patient developed a left prefrontal subdural haematoma. Upon his recovery, the obsession symptoms disappeared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The other case is a man who attempted suicide by shooting his head over the left temple, causing left frontal lobe damage. Although no frontal lobe syndrome emerged, his obsessive rituals were significantly reduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The other case following the clinical diagnosis of arterial hypertension he sustained a brain hemorrhage. As a consequence of this cerebral accident his obsessive-compulsive symptoms were absent. However, as a progression of the clot retraction began gradually to take place, his obsessive-compulsive symptoms considerably returned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The connection of these three cases, associated with OCD, indicates that specific cerebral sites affected by a given lesion may ablate “therapeutically” a preexisting disorder that is OCD. Furthermore, because in one case lesions are located in the left basal ganglia region, the other two in the left frontal region, and in our case, lesions located in temporoparietoccipital. Suggests that lesions affect association circuits linking neuronal columns of the BG and the prefrontal area, regardless of a specific anatomical location within the operational circuit, may modify obsessive-compulsive symptomatology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:45:30", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:27", "cost": 116.296}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:45:28"}

He was transported to our emergency department because of generalized tonic-clonic seizure, vision loss, and impaired consciousness with acute hypertension after 8 cycles of treatment (2 years after the initiation of sunitinib therapy, including a drug withdrawal period for one year). MRI of the brain (FLAIR images) showed multiple high-intensity lesions in the white matter of the occipital and cerebellar lobes, dorsal brain stem, and left thalamus. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome caused by sunitinib was suspected. In addition to the immediate discontinuation of sunitinib therapy, the administration of antihypertensive agents and anticonvulsants improved the clinical symptoms without neurological damage. Physicians should be aware that sunitinib causes reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. The early recognition of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is critical to avoid irreversible neurological damage.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Kidney tumors comprise approximately 2% of all malignancies in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, and the majority of kidney tumors are renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Approximately 30% of RCCs involve metastatic disease at the diagnosis, and 50% of patients who receive curative surgery experience RCC relapse at distant sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Sunitinib is one of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It has been elucidated that sunitinib inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, subsequently leading to the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Sunitinib was approved for advanced RCC in 2006 in Japan. Well-known adverse events caused by sunitinib include hypertension, fatigue, thyroid dysfunction, cardiotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicities such as diarrhea, stomatitis and nausea, leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and skin toxicity. Herein, we describe the first reported Japanese case of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) that developed on receiving sunitinib therapy for metastatic RCC.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 64-year-old man had undergone left nephrectomy for left renal cell carcinoma (clear cell carcinoma, G2, pT2N0M0) at the age of 57 years. Treatment with sunitinib (50 mg daily for 4 weeks every 6 weeks) was initiated for the metastasis of stomach greater curvature lymph nodes 5 years after left nephrectomy. Physical examination demonstrated no relevant abnormalities. His performance status was 0, and the blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Mild renal insufficiency (the serum creatinine level was 1.26 mg/dL, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 45.7 mL/min) was noted on laboratory examination. Sunitinib treatment proceeded well without deterioration of the renal function, elevation of the blood pressure, or thyroid dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated stable disease after 4 cycles of sunitinib treatment. He requested the discontinuation of sunitinib treatment because of general fatigue, and he was followed up without sunitinib administration. Treatment with sunitinib was restarted (50 mg daily for 4 weeks every 6 weeks) one year after its discontinuation because of progressive disease (new metastatic lesions on the left adrenal gland and pancreas head) on enhanced CT.\n\n【6】He was transported to our emergency department with symptoms of generalized tonic-clonic seizure, vision loss, and lack of consciousness 5 months after restarting the sunitinib therapy (2 years since the initiation of sunitinib therapy). The symptoms developed during an on-period (day 23) of the sunitinib therapy. He had no history of head injury, epilepsy, or hypertension, nor a family history of neurological or psychiatric disorders.\n\n【7】He was afebrile, and his pupillary reflexes were prompt and preserved bilaterally. The blood pressure was markedly elevated at the time of presentation (230/129 mmHg). Blood examination suggested no electrolyte imbalance. Brain CT demonstrated no evidence of metastatic brain tumors nor intracerebral hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (FLAIR images) showed multiple high-intensity lesions in the white matter of the occipital and cerebellar lobes, dorsal brain stem, and left thalamus . Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on MRI showed the elevation of ADC value mapping. According to the MRI findings and clinical course, RPLS caused by sunitinib treatment was suspected. Sunitinib was discontinued immediately. An antihypertensive drug, nicardipine, was started to control the blood pressure, and an anticonvulsant, fosphenytoin, was administered to control seizures. The blood pressure rapidly returned to normal. MRI of the brain 20 days after admission showed significant resolution of the multiple high-intensity lesions in the white matter . No episode of seizure developed during the hospitalization, and the blood pressure was maintained as normal without any antihypertensive drugs in 3 weeks. He was discharged from the hospital 26 days after admission without any neurological symptoms. Although an m-TOR inhibitor, everolimus, was started for metastatic lesions of the lymph node, left adrenal, and pancreas head, he died of the disease 5 months after administration of the m-TOR inhibitor.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 MRI (FLAIR images) of the brain on admission.

RPLS is also referred to as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). RPLS correlates with cerebral vasogenic edema because of the elevation of the blood pressure, and toxic damage to the blood-brain barrier or vascular endothelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Its pathogenesis involves the disruption of cerebral vascular endothelial cells and impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation, which lead to cerebral edema secondary to a variety of conditions, including arterial hypertension, eclampsia, collagen vascular disorders, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytic purpura 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Some immunosuppressive agents and cytotoxic drugs such as tacrolimus, cyclosporin A, and cisplatin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> lead to cerebral cytotoxic edema and may cause RPLS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.

In our case, MRI showed multiple high-intensity lesions in the white matter not only of the occipital and cerebellar lobes, but also of the dorsal brain stem and left thalamus, although it is minor involvement, with a high ADC value on DWI, being a typical MRI finding of RPLS.\n\n【13】RPLS has been reported to be caused by treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-inhibitors such as bevacizumab and sorafenib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. There is, however, a very rare entity of RPLS triggered by treatment with sunitinib. According to the database PubMed using the key words of “reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome and sunitinib”, only 11 cases of RPLS due to sunitinib have been reported in the literature  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–8\\]</u>. The duration until the onset after the administration of sunitinib varies from several days to several months. Our case showed the longest interval: 2 years since the initial induction, and 5 months since the restart of sunitinib. The blood pressure at the presentation of clinical symptoms of RPLS was elevated in all except one patient. All patients discontinued sunitinib immediately after the onset of RPLS. Nine out of 12 patients received antihypertensive agents to control the blood pressure, and 8 out of the 12 patients received anticonvulsants to manage seizures. In all the patients except one, prompt and appropriate managements completely resolved their neurological symptoms in a few days to several weeks. The remaining one died from RCC in a few weeks after the onset of RPLS. After the complete resolution of symptoms associated with RPLS, all the patients did not restart sunitinib.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome caused by sunitinib treatment.</u>\n\n【15】In our case, RPLS due to sunitinib occurred after 5-month medication with the drug after a drug withdrawal period of one year. We do not know the mechanism of the development of RPLS after restarting sunitinib therapy, although the patient had no signs of RPLS before the withdrawal of the drug for one year. According to the clinical signs and MRI findings, however, he was diagnosed with RPLS due to sunitinib.\n\n【16】Although MRI findings of RPLS improved in a median of 20 days in 88% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, the neurological damage could be potentially life-threatening or irreversible if RPLS is not treated immediately, and any causative drugs are not discontinued 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. Physicians should monitor the patients closely, and the early recognition of RPLS is critical to avoid irreversible neurological damage.\n\n【17】In conclusion, we describe the first reported Japanese case of RPLS due to sunitinib.

Glaucoma is associated in 50% of the patients. Craniofacial and dental anomalies are frequently reported with ARS. The present study was designed as a multidisciplinary analysis of orthodontic, ophthalmologic, and genotypical features. A three-generation pedigree was ascertained through a family with ARS. Clinically, radiographic and genetic analyses were performed. Despite an identical genotype in all patients, the phenotype varies in expressivity of craniofacial and dental morphology. Screening for PITX2 and FOXC1 mutations by direct DNA-sequencing revealed a P64L missense mutation in PITX2 in all family members, supporting earlier reports that PITX2 is an essential factor in morphogenesis of teeth and craniofacial skeleton. Despite the fact that the family members had identical mutations, morphologic differences were evident. The concomitant occurrence of rare dental and craniofacial anomalies may be early diagnostic indications of ARS. Early detection of ARS and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) helps to prevent visual field loss.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) (OMIM Nr.: 180500) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder (1  :  200000) with variable morphology characterized by malformations of the anterior segment of the eye such as Iris hypoplasia, iridocorneal adhesions, corectopia, polycoria, and embryotoxon posterius. Glaucoma is associated in 50% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Craniofacial, dental, and umbilical anomalies are also regularly reported in connection with ARS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Characteristic craniofacial features are maxillary hypoplasia, hypertelorism, and telecanthus. Dental features include hypodontia/oligodontia of primary and permanent dentition, microdontia, short roots, taurodontism, and abnormally shaped teeth.\n\n【4】Other systemic features like anomalies of the pituitary gland, middle ear deafness, heart defects, hypospadia, short stature, and mental retardation were diagnosed in several ARS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Three genetic loci have been associated with ARS so far. The genes FOXC1 and PITX2 encode transcription factors and are located on chromosomes 6p25 and 4q25, respectively. A third locus for ARS was mapped to chromosome 13q14 but the gene has not yet been identified. Therefore ARS has to be considered as a morphologically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and genetically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> heterogeneous disorder.\n\n【6】In recent years there has been increasing focus on the clinical as well as a the molecular-genetic aspects of ARS. However, there is an absence of detailed description of the craniofacial and dental manifestations in patients with PITX2 mutation.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【8】In the present multidisciplinary clinical and genetic study of the pedigree four patients with ARS were examined by an ophthalmologist, a dentist, and an orthodontist.\n\n【9】A three-generation pedigree of the family members was constructed . All four patients were screened for mutations in PITX2 and FOXC1 by direct DNA sequencing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Three-generation pedigree of the reported family. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】The craniofacial and dental examination of the patients involved lateral cephalometric radiographs and orthopantomograms. Analysis of plaster casts was made. The cephalograms were taken with the patients in a cephalostat with ear rods and a light source for adjustment of the head posture. The film-focus distance was 150 cm and the distance from the midsagittal plane to the film was 10 cm, resulting in an enlargement factor of 15%. Angular and linear measurements were made from each cephalogram. The position of the maxilla and mandible Was analyzed by the respective SNA and SNB angles. The skeletal configuration was defined by the Wits appraisal (the AB/Occlusal Plane angle). A metric analysis was done for the length of the maxilla and the mandible. The calibrated cephalometric results were compared to standards of a mean population group by Rakosi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【13】All four family members showed a sella turcica bridge combined with a prominent posterior clinoid process followed by a steep clivus and an elongated sella turcica, described by Meyer-Marcotty et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【14】##### 3.1. DNA Analysis\n\n【15】Sequence analysis revealed a variant in the PITX2 gene. Our four patients were found to have a heterozygous C to T transition at nucleotide position 774.

ARS was diagnosed at the age of 28 due to impaired vision by the patient herself.\n\n【19】Ophthalmologic and General Examination  \nThe patient presented with embryotoxon posterius, iridocorneal adhesions, and hypoplasia of the iris with the sphincter muscle visible in both eyes . She suffers from glaucoma with a visual field loss of Stage II according to Aulhorn stage classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The highest recorded intraocular pressure (IOPmax) was 36 mmHg in the right eye and 20 mmHg in the left eye. The patient has a protuberant umbilicus.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Embryotoxon posterius ( ↑ ) and hypoplasia of the iris in patient 1. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【21】Dental and Craniofacial Findings  \nThe patient's dental history revealed agenesis unspecified teeth as well as a conspicuous conical shape of the upper permanent incisors. No orthodontic treatment had been undertaken in the past. After additional loss of permanent teeth removable partial dentures were incorporated in the upper and lower jaw.  \nExtraoral examination of the patient showed a pronounced retrusive lip profile.  \nCephalometric analysis indicated skeletal Class III malformation due to severe maxillary retrognathia. Metric analysis of the jaws showed a highly shortened maxilla (micrognathia).

Patient 2\n\n【24】Patient’s History  \nThis 24-year-old female patient was diagnosed with ARS positive during a routine check in early childhood due to the knowledge of the familial predisposition of ARS and glaucoma.\n\n【25】Ophthalmologic and General Examination  \nEmbryotoxon posterius, iridocorneal adhesions, Iris hypoplasia, and corectopia are evident in both eyes. There is no record of elevated IOP. The patient has a protuberant umbilicus.\n\n【26】Dental and Craniofacial Findings  \nOrthopantomograms taken at the age of 11 years 3 months and 16 years 6 months were available for examination. Agenesis of the upper lateral incisors, taurodontism, microdontia as well a crown hypoplasia of the upper central incisors was present .

Patient 3\n\n【29】Patient’s History  \nThis 26-year-old female patient suffers from ARS-related ocular hypertension. Her condition was diagnosed at the age of 17 when she went for an examination to an ophthalmologist because of diminished vision which she noticed herself.\n\n【30】Ophthalmologic and General Examination  \nAn ophthalmologic examination identified embryotoxon posterius, iridocorneal adhesions, corectopia, and hypoplasia of the iris visible in both eyes . IOPmax was 35 mmHg in both eyes and medical regulation proved to be sufficient. There is no loss of visual field evident up to date. The patient has a protuberant umbilicus.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Corectopia ( ↑ ) and hypoplasia ( ↑ ↑ ) of the iris in patient 3. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【32】Dental and Craniofacial Findings  \nThe orthopantomogram at the age of 15 revealed agenesis of multiple permanent teeth in association with hypoplastic upper central incisors. Besides agenesis of the second premolars of the upper and lower jaw, the upper lateral incisors were not present. Moreover, a very rare agenesis of the upper left canine was evident .  \nAfter correction of the skeletal Class III relationship by means of combined orthodontic-orthognathic therapy the orthopantomogram showed a tendency for root resorption on almost any tooth with a significant reduction of half of the root length of the lower incisors and the lower first molars .  \nThe pretherapeutical cephalometric analysis at 15 years of age revealed a normal sagittal position of the mandible . In contrast, the maxilla showed a significant retrognathia resulting in a severe skeletal Class III relationship .

Besides agenesis of the lower right second premolar, the orthopantomogram showed a very rare instance of two missing upper molars . The comparison of the developmental stages between the upper and lower teeth indicated agenesis of the upper first molars. Moreover, taurodontism of the upper and lower molars with variable degree was evident, as well as a paraplasia on the distal aspect of the upper third molar root .  \nThe patient showed conical shaped lateral and central incisors and hypoplastic molar crowns.  \nThe cephalometric measurement revealed a severe skeletal Class III, as seen by a decreased SNA angle combined with a normative SNB.

Review of the Literature\n\n【42】In twelve published case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 12–22\\]</u> descriptions of the dental and craniofacial phenotype of 17 ARS patients who were examined by an ophthalmologist and a dentist are given.\n\n【43】When the four cases examined in the present study are included, 21 patients have been evaluated up to now.\n\n【44】All the patients presented with hypodontia. These findings were documented in either the primary or permanent dentition depending on the age of the patient.\n\n【45】In 15 out of the 21 cases a detailed description of agenesis of permanent teeth was available. In the remaining 6 cases only the total number of missing teeth was reported, ranging from 3 to as many as 20. The teeth most frequently missing were the upper lateral incisors as well as the upper and lower second premolars. Other teeth whose absence was reported were central incisors, canines, first premolars, and first and second molars. Teeth of the upper jaw tended to be missing more frequently .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 9 | Frequency of agenesis of permanent upper teeth in 15 patients with ARS and hypodontia. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 10 | Frequency of agenesis of permanent lower teeth in 15 patients with ARS and hypodontia. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【48】Data on congenital absence of primary teeth were available in 11 out of 21 cases. The teeth most often absent were the upper and lower deciduous incisors, missing in 40% and 18% of the patients, respectively.\n\n【49】Microdontia has been observed in 17 patients. In 6 patients only maxillary teeth were affected, in 11 patients teeth in both jaws were hypoplastic. Three patients displayed generalized microdontia of all teeth. The teeth series most often affected was the upper and lower incisors, followed by premolars, canines, and molars. Other dental anomalies reported included taurodontism, enamel hypoplasia, short roots, paraplasia, and delayed eruption.\n\n【50】Maxillary hypoplasia was present in 19 out of 21 patients (90.5%), resulting in a Class III facial profile combined with a flat midface, concave facial profile, receding upper lip, or prominent lower lip.\n\n【51】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【52】Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome is a very rare condition. Thus, the number of patients studied is limited. In addition, this disease shows morphologic variability in terms of frequency and expression of associated anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5, 6\\]</u>. Therefore, a detailed presentation of dental and craniofacial anomalies in patients with ARS is necessary. In our previous study of 26 patients with ARS and glaucoma or ocular hypertension, dentofacial anomalies were evident in 27% of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This is consistent with the studies by Shields et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and Ozeki et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> on 24 and 21 patients with ARS, respectively.\n\n【53】Our patients show a missense mutation in the PITX2 gene. PITX2 is a transcription factor controlling the expression of other genes during development. This factor is essential for correct differentiation and migration of cells developing tissues and organs. Expression of PITX2 in mice has been found in periocular mesenchyme, maxillary, mandibular and dental epithelia, umbilicus, Rathke’s pouch, and vitelline vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【54】PITX2 has been identified as an activator of the Dlx2 gene that is also expressed in maxillary and mandibular and dental epithelia. Dlx2 is part of the “odontogenic homeobox code” essential for tooth and craniofacial development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Therefore dental anomalies in ARS patients can be explained by PITX2 mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Depending on the transactivation ability of a PITX2 mutant different phenotypes from mild Iris hypoplasia to the whole spectrum of ARS including severe dental and craniofacial anomalies have been observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【55】In normal Caucasian population hypodontia occurs in males with an incidence of 4.6%, in females of 6.3%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. The teeth most often absent are the lower second premolars followed by the upper lateral incisors and the upper second premolars with a frequency of 1.5%–3.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. By contrast, all of our ARS patients presented with hypodontia. Moreover, two of the siblings exhibited very rare types of tooth agenesis, such as of an upper canine in patient 3 and of upper molars in patient 4, respectively.\n\n【56】Microdontia also seems to be a characteristic finding in ARS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In all of our patients a conical shape of the upper central incisors was reported. Additionally, in patient 4 microdontic lower molars were found which is a very rare condition in general population with an incidence of 0.1%–0.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【57】Taurodontism occurs in approximately 0.3% of the white European population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. In patient 4 all molars were affected. This finding supports the hypothesis of previous reports that taurodontism is one of the characteristic dental anomalies in ARS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【58】The observed root resorption in two of the siblings may indicate a higher risk of root resorption in ARS patients during orthodontic treatment.\n\n【59】The four presented cases underwent cephalometric analysis in order to evaluate the craniofacial morphology.\n\n【60】Three of the patients exhibited a severe skeletal Class III malocclusion caused by maxillary retrognathia associated with a shortened maxilla. In contrast, mandibular position was in an almost normal range.\n\n【61】The extent of skeletal Class III in our ARS patients was similar to the severity of hypodontia and other dental anomalies. Patient 3 with an agenesis of seven permanent teeth exhibited the most distinctive dysgnathia, whereas patient 2 with agenesis of the upper lateral incisors exhibited almost orthognathic jaw relationships. Drum et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> concluded that an alveolar hypoplasia resulting from missing teeth contributes to a maxillary deficiency. In the present study it seems that the number of missing teeth may play a certain role in the extent of maxillary hypoplasia. However, the reduced maxillary length deficiency seen in our ARS patients is not exclusively limited to the alveolar region but also is evident in the maxillary base. Therefore, maxillary hypoplasia may not completely be explained by the number of congenitally absent teeth. It can be assumed that additional craniofacial factors may influence maxillary growth in ARS patients. Childers and Wright 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> also hypothesied that midface hypoplasia associated with ARS is a combination of skeletal and dentoalveolar factors.\n\n【62】Early diagnosis of ARS and control of IOP is essential to prevent visual impairment. Ophthalmologists, paediatricians, dentists, and orthodontists have to be aware that ARS is an inherited autosomal dominant anomaly and therefore all family members have to be screened as early as possible. Despite this fact, ARS frequently is diagnosed late. Even hypoplasia of the iris, visible without special instruments, does not reduce the mean age at diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition, two of the patients included in this study were diagnosed only after symptoms of elevated IOP were noticed by the patients themselves.\n\n【63】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【64】Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a very rare disorder with genetic and morphologic variability. The concomitant occurrence of rare dental and craniofacial anomalies in these patients, such as hypoplasia of the central incisors, rare types of tooth agenesis such as an upper canine or upper molars associated with maxillary retrognathia, and a skeletal Class III may be indications of ARS. Early detection of ARS and measuring potentially elevated intraocular pressure helps physicians to prevent visual field loss.\n\n【65】The data used in this report are based on the dissertation “Phänotyp und Genotyp des Axenfeld- Rieger- Syndroms” by P.

There were no other abnormalities on the neurological examination. Complete blood cell count and blood chemistry were within normal ranges. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and chest X-P findings demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a localized LMI on the left side .

Discussion\n\n【8】In LMI, it is well known that various neurological symptoms, such as sensory disturbance, cerebellar ataxia, dizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, Horner’s syndrome, skew deviation, ocular tilt reaction, nystagmus, dysarthria, dysphagia, and hiccups commonly occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. On the other hand, Kameda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported that of the 167 patients of LMI, 11 patients (7%) were diagnosed as having Opalski’s syndrome, which is defined as LMI case with ipsilateral hemiparesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–11\\]</u>. Opalski’s syndrome may be caused by ischemia of the ipsilateral corticospinal tract caudal to the pyramidal decussation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–11\\]</u>. Dhamoon et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> described that the regional perfusion failure of the corticospinal tract caudal to the pyramidal decussation might be the result of a hemodynamic mechanism, because this area might be a junctional zone between the anterior and posterior spinal artery and between the vertebral and spinal artery supplied. Whereas, regarding the etiology of Opalski’s syndrome, the vertebral artery occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u> and infarction of the medullary penetrating artery arising from the vertebral artery or anterior spinal artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> were also speculated.\n\n【9】Although the somatotopic arrangements of the corticospinal tract in the human brain have been generally elucidated, very little is known about the somatotopy in the medulla oblongata 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. In 2011, based on the diffusion tensor tractography analysis, Kwon et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported that the hand somatotopy of the corticospinal tract was located at the medial portion of the medullary pyramid, in contrast, the leg somatotopy occupied its lateral portion. However, the somatotopic arrangements of the corticospinal tract in the lower medulla oblongata remain unclear.\n\n【10】To date, there was only one reported case of LMI with ipsilateral monoparesis of the leg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated infarction of the medullary penetrating artery secondary to vertebral artery dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore, Liu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> speculated that the corticospinal tract fibers innervating the lower and upper extremities decussate at different levels. Furthermore, vertigo, nystagmus, Horner’s syndrome, ataxia in the upper extremity, and alternating hypalgesia were observed in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Whereas, in our present patient, though cranial magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated an absence of flow of the left vertebral artery, cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that a very small infarct lesion in the lower lateral medulla oblongata on the left side. Therefore, we believed that the corticospinal tract caudal to the pyramidal decussation might be involved by atherothrombotic infarction of the medullary penetrating artery or hemodynamic mechanism due to congenital hypoplasia of the left vertebral artery. Regarding the etiology of unilateral leg weakness due to ipsilateral LMI, we agree with Liu and colleagues’ hypothesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> that the corticospinal tract fibers innervating the lower and upper extremities decussate at different levels in the lower medulla oblongata.

This case report represents a unique case of using multiple spinal cord stimulators for widespread small fiber neuropathy pain. This case report concerns patient JJ who first presented with generalized neuropathic pain. His pain was an intermittent burning, stinging quality that originally focused in both of his feet and progressed to include his legs and arms and eventually involved his entire body. The pain would last moments to hours at least daily. He reported a poor quality of life. He was diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy with anhydrosis, suggestive of idiopathic erythromelalgia. He had a spinal cord stimulator trial involving both cervical and lower thoracic percutaneous leads. After two spinal cord stimulators were implanted, the patient began to report an improvement in pain. The patient continues to report excellent pain relief. The patient uses the stimulator intermittently as needed, in an abortive fashion for pain flares. The patient is very pleased and has increased his activity. He now attends graduate school full time. This case report hopes to illustrate a unique use of multiple spinal cord stimulators in treating widespread neuropathic pain caused by small fiber neuropathy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Neuromodulation has been classically defined by the International Neuromodulation Society as “the alteration of nerve activity through targeted delivery of a stimulus, such as electrical stimulation or chemical agents, to specific neurological sites in the body” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and spinal cord stimulation is a type of neuromodulation where epidural leads are placed in the body and attached to an implanted pulse generator to create a current that helps modify different types of neural signals. In our context, the desire is to decrease pain signaling.\n\n【4】Spinal cord stimulators (SCS) have been commonly used to treat multiple pain conditions including complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), failed laminectomy/failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), and severe low back pain refractory to other treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Now as the use of spinal cord stimulators has increased so have the potential indications. Recently, SCS have been used to effectively treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. SCS has increasingly been used in various neuropathic pain syndromes when standard treatments had already failed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u><sub>.</sub> SCS is already being used for small fiber neuropathy. In 2015, a retrospective study by Hayek et al. found that out of the 345 patients who underwent SCS trial, 18 patients had a SCS implanted for small fiber neuropathic pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Also, in 2017, Maino et al. described a case of a patient with small fiber neuropathy whose pain was treated successfully with spinal cord stimulation but that was using dorsal root ganglion stimulation and treating pain in only one limb (left foot) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. While these studies help to establish SCS as a reliable treatment for small fiber neuropathic pain, our case report hopes to illustrate a unique use of two SCS implants and four leads to treat whole body pain in a patient with small fiber neuropathy.\n\n【5】Small fiber neuropathy is a sensory neuropathy manifested usually by painful paresthesias, along with findings of abnormal small fiber nerve function seen on neurological examination, specialized electrodiagnostic testing, and/or pathological studies. Common etiologies include diabetes, B12 deficiency, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disorders. It is commonly treated with medications such as antidepressants (TCAs and SSRIs), anticonvulsants, opioids, and topical capsaicin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. There are also case reports and studies of spinal cord stimulation being used to successfully treat small fiber neuropathic pain; few however have included dual implants with one set of leads and battery to treat the upper extremity pain and another set of leads and battery for the lower extremity.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Methods\n\n【7】This case report concerns patient JJ who first presented to a neurologist for generalized neuropathic pain in 2013. On August 7, 2013, patient JJ was a twenty-year-old male and visited neurology for the first time that day. He had already suffered numbness and tingling in his feet with sharp stinging pain that had progressed into his legs, hands, arms, trunk, and face. The pain started about a year earlier. His triggers included heat and physical activity and lifting things for a long period of time or high intensity short bursts of activity would cause the pain. Pain episodes would also happen while he was sleeping and wake him up. At that point, he had already tried gabapentin, pregabalin, and escitalopram and he was on buprenorphine and fentanyl patches with still no relief. An MRI of his brain and cervical spine were normal.\n\n【8】The neurologist stated that the history was suggestive of small fiber neuropathy but that other differentials had to be ruled out. A NCS/EMG, skin biopsy, and multiple labs were ordered. The NCS showed no evidence of large fiber neuropathy and the other labs helped to rule out other differential causes. Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) showed reduced sweat volumes at all sites with a non-length dependent reduction providing evidence of non-length dependent painful small fiber neuropathy. The neurologist determined that JJ had small fiber neuropathy with anhydrosis, suggestive of idiopathic erythromelalgia. A trial of prednisolone was attempted but patient had no relief of pain. By this time, patient JJ stopped the buprenorphine and fentanyl patches and had no relief with other medications including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or duloxetine. JJ began to report a poor quality of life. He felt unable to go to any uncontrolled environments due to the severe episodes of sharp debilitating pain. He, along with his family, was becoming desperate for other pain relief options. His neurologist referred the patient to the UTHSCSA pain management consultants for more options.\n\n【9】On January 27, 2014, JJ presented to our pain clinic for the first time. At that point, we considered JJ to have diffuse episodic neuropathic pain that occurred at least daily and had an unclear etiology. We discussed the various options with the patient including infusion therapy, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, and spinal cord stimulation. After that initial visit, the patient and family elected to try other pharmacologic options, including orphenadrine, dextromethorphan, and mexiletine. The patient also received two ketamine infusions: 150 mg over one hour on 04/17/2014 and 360 mg over one hour on 09/04/2014. During this time, the patient was still receiving work-up including being referred for whole exome sequencing but no abnormality was found in the relevant genes. JJ wanted to try a lidocaine infusion before SCS so he received a lidocaine infusion on 11/12/15. Unfortunately, the lidocaine infusions like all the previous therapies did not offer him much pain relief. On November 2015, JJ began to seriously consider SCS therapy and eventually agreed to a SCS trial. Due to his pain pattern with bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, the decision was made to try both cervical and thoracic leads.\n\n【10】On February 9, 2016, our clinic performed a SCS trial with one lead tip ending at the top of the T8 vertebral body level and a second lead tip at the top of the C3 vertebral body level. JJ had a great response with the trial and wanted to move on to implantation.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【12】On March 22, 2016, JJ had two SCS generators and two cervical and two thoracic leads implanted in conjunction with neurosurgeon Dr. Papanastassiou .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Two 8-contact epidural leads lying in their final position in the mid-thoracic spine.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Two 8-contact epidural leads from the spinal cord stimulator lying in their final position in the cervical spine.</u>\n\n【15】After the two spinal cord stimulators and generators were implanted, the patient began to report an improvement in pain. This stimulation was tonic and paresthesia based. The patient continued to report excellent pain relief six months after implantation. Within six months, patient had 100% abolition of pain in his extremities and lower body half while using stimulation. This represented about 90% of his overall pain. The stimulation covered his arms, his waist down to his legs, and most of his trunk with one small gap. The patient uses the stimulator intermittently as needed, in an abortive fashion for pain flares. JJ had had no complaints of autonomic or erythromelalgia symptoms.\n\n【16】The patient was extremely pleased and increased his activity. He is no longer taking any analgesic or antiepileptic medications. He is able to ride his scooter and wear a backpack and now attends graduate school full time.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Plenty of discussion and research has been done on treatment of FBSS, CRPS, and axial low back pain through neuromodulation but very little literature exists about the possible role of neuromodulation and specifically SCS in the treatment of small fiber neuropathy.\n\n【19】Patient JJ had a long and complicated medical course and underwent over three years of medical testing, including numerous imaging studies as well as invasive tests like skin biopsies. Earlier neuromodulation intervention could have saved him years of suffering. It is debatable whether the implantation of the two batteries is cost-effective. However, it is clear that neuromodulation has done more for the patient’s refractory pain than any other treatment while also avoiding the risks associated with medications and side effects. In addition, JJ’s use of spinal cord stimulation in an abortive manner is a unique use of the therapy. Typically, patients have their SCS on throughout the day, changing modes as needed, but JJ seemed to only need SCS before attacks to prevent them or during attacks to stop them.\n\n【20】This case report indicates a small sample of what is possible with neuromodulation and the emerging role neuromodulation can play in addressing atypical and neuropathic pain conditions. As previously stated, SCS is already being used for diabetic and small fiber neuropathy pain.

His condition was combined with decline in his functional activity, malaise, loss of appetite, and loss of weight of about 30 Ibs. He also noticed painless ulcerating skin lesions, progressively increasing in size over his face, neck, and the scalp. His past medical history was significant for hypertension and Alzheimer’s dementia. He had 60-pack-year history of smoking. On examination, vital signs were within normal limits. BMI was 17.1. He appeared lethargic with temporal and facial muscle wasting. Skin finding revealed multiple large, firm, mobile, nontender, ulcerative skin lesions with hyperemic centers and elevated rolled edges, which were located on the left side of the chin and scalp areas . He also had a nodular lesion on the right lower face  and a black hairy tongue. Chest examination showed diminished air entry with dullness to left upper chest. Laboratory tests showed WBC /L and hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL. The chest radiograph (CXR) showed abnormal soft tissue fullness at the left hilum. Computed tomography of the chest (CT) revealed a 5 cm large centrally located left upper lobe mass resulting in constriction to the left upper lobe bronchus and left upper lobe atelectasis , associated with left hilar adenopathy. Bronchoscopy showed that a mass was visualized at the junction of the left upper lobe, and the lingula, completely occluding the entry to the left upper lobe and biopsies were obtained. Skin biopsy was performed, and the result was consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and was identical to the histopathology of the left lung mass.

Discussion\n\n【8】Lung cancer is a common neoplasm affecting men and women usually after the age of fifty. Only early stage operable disease can be cured, while the remainder of patients develop distant metastases and die. Most common sites of metastasis include the bones, liver, adrenal gland, and brain, while the skin is rarely affected. The percentage of patients with lung cancer that develop skin metastases ranges from 1 to 10%. This must be ruled out in patients with suspicious skin lesions and history of smoking or lung cancer. The diagnosis is usually made using clinical information, and skin biopsy should be obtained for histological examination. All histological types of lung cancer may metastasize to the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The incidence of cutaneous metastasis is highest among patient with large-cell carcinoma (2.5%) and low for squamous (0.7%) and small-cell carcinoma (0.3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In about 20–60% of cases, the skin lesions are present before or at the same time with the diagnosis of the primary lung tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Any body skin area can be involved with metastasis but lung cancers commonly involve the anterior chest, abdomen, and head/neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Skin lesions have been described in the literature as nodular or ulcerated, mobile or fixed, hard or flexible, single or multiple, and painless lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Awareness of this complication and a high level of suspicion allow early diagnosis and treatment, thereby reducing the morbidity of this condition. We present a case of a pseudoaneurysm of a perforating branch of the PFA after revision THA which was treated successfully by selective coil embolization.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pseudoaneurysm of the PFA or its branches is an unusual and serious complication after THA. Vascular injuries are a rare complication after orthopedic surgery of the hip. The complication rate is reported to be approximately 0.2–0.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In a large series of >13,000 cases, an incidence of 0.04% in primary THA increasing to 0.19% in revision surgery was seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Such complications account for the third most common iatrogenic injury after those caused by catheterization and trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. They can result in significant mortality (7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, amputation (1.6%), and persistent ischemia (7.3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These complications can include thromboembolism, direct vessel laceration, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula formation. Etiologies are direct trauma from surgical instruments, joint manipulation and dislocation, protrusion of cement or screws, excessive retraction, and heat injury from the exothermic reaction generated during cement (methyl methacrylate) polymerization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Furthermore, there is an increased incidence in patients undergoing redo arthroplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. As stated by Del Prince et al, the prevalence of vascular injuries post redo arthroplasty ranged between 0.06 and 0.2%. These injuries are classified into 2 groups: acute-onset vascular injury and delayed-onset vascular injury. Acute onset vascular injury may occur intraoperatively secondary to direct trauma from surgical instruments or cement. As mentioned by An et al. delayed vascular injury can result from postoperative trauma to vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Vascular damage resulting from this procedure may present in many ways including pain, obvious bleeding, hemodynamic instability, anemia, a pulsatile mass, and limb ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. De Boer et al. stated that the most common locations of pseudoaneurysms after THA are the external iliac artery and the common femoral artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Injuries and pseudoaneurysms of the PFA and its branches are very rare after THA as the artery is not close to the operation site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 14\\]</u>. Some cases resulting from chronic repeated trauma by a projecting screw were reported after intertrochanteric fracture treated by internal fixation with a dynamic hip screw plate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Recent studies have concentrated on a pseudoaneurysm of the PFA that has been reported approximately two months after THA, in contact with a cement leak from the hole of the removed screw from the prior osteosynthesis of an intertrochanteric fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. Öztürk et al. reported a pseudoaneurysm of the PFA after bipolar hemiarthroplasty, caused by the sharp edge of a fractured lesser trochanter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【7】In light of this, a risk factor for redo procedures is the presence of vascular damage due to THA, an uncommon complication for these injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Because of its location deep in the thigh, pseudoaneurysm of the PFA often presents late with persistent pain and swelling. Patients may not present with the usual sign of a pulsatile mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm is especially dependent upon suspicion because the symptoms and signs are nonspecific which makes it a challenging process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As a result, if there is persistent pain and swelling in the thigh after THA, additional vascular investigations should be performed. Noting that, it can be diagnosed by Doppler ultrasonography or computed tomography. Angiography, however, is needed for definitive diagnosis and for endovascular repair if needed.\n\n【8】In this article, the authors present a case of a pseudoaneurysm of a perforating branch of the PFA following revision THA treated successfully by selective coil embolization.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【10】This article presents a case study of a 50-year-old lady with no significant medical history who underwent a right THA for congenital hip dysplasia. Recurrent dislocations were the indication for revision THA after 6 years.\n\n【11】Two weeks postoperatively, during her stay at the rehabilitation center, she started complaining of severe, worsening pain localized to the right groin. Clinical neurologic and vascular examinations were normal. Radiographs showed satisfactory positioning of the hip prosthesis. The orthopedic consultation revealed no orthopedic origin of her complaints. Duplex ultrasound showed a small pseudoaneurysm arising from the profunda femoris (ying-yang pattern on the color flow and to-and-fro waveform on the spectral doppler); no signs of venous thromboembolism were noted. A trial of ultrasound-guided compression was done without success. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 14 × 22 mm pseudoaneurysm originating from a distal perforating branch of the right PFA . Considering that no thrombin was available for an ultrasound-guided injection of the pseudoaneurysm, the endovascular repair was our treatment of choice. Arteriography was done via left femoral artery retrograde access confirming the presence of the pseudoaneurysm . Subsequently, selective catheterization of the distal perforating branch of the right PFA was performed using Progreat™ microcatheter (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and successful embolization was achieved using 2 and 3 mm platinum coils (Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France), placed distal and proximal to the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. Subsequent injection of the contrast medium demonstrated no flow into the pseudoaneurysm . Following embolization, the patient had a gradual improvement of her symptoms. The patient revealed that she had no pain, claudication, or swelling at follow-up 6 weeks later, and the control CT scan showed no recurrent vascular lesion over a 6-month period .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT with contrast showing the right deep femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Arteriography showing the pseudoaneurysm pre-embolization.

Results and Discussion\n\n【16】In our case, the pseudoaneurysm originated from a distal perforating branch of the PFA. There was no evidence of direct trauma from surgical instruments because it was far from the operation site; also, the injured artery was not in contact with a protrusion of cement, bone edge, or screws. During the operation on a redo case, the hip was moved out of place, which could have torn the blood vessel.\n\n【17】Moreover, the presentation was a nonspecific groin pain 15 days postoperatively, which raised the suspicion of vascular complications and indicated a diagnostic procedure.\n\n【18】Doppler ultrasonography and a CT scan can be used to diagnose pseudoaneurysms in these cases. Angiography, however, was needed for a definitive diagnosis and transcatheter treatment.\n\n【19】Open surgical repair of a pseudoaneurysm of the PFA can be difficult because of the location of the PFA, deep in the muscle compartment of the thigh. Transcatheter or ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection of thrombin, coil, or fibrin adhesive has been reported to occlude a similar pseudoaneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–22\\]</u>. Transcatheter embolization with a coil provided an easier and less invasive technique than open surgical repair in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Nozawa et al. reported a case of pseudoaneurysm of the PFA after THA was treated by transcatheter embolization of the PFA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Lund et al. described the treatment of pseudoaneurysm of the median circumflex artery following THA by coil embolization using selective catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Zhang et al. described 4 cases of successful embolization procedures done to deep femoral artery pseudoaneurysms after hip fracture surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Successful embolization in our case was achieved using selective catheterization of the perforating branch of the PFA and coil embolization distal and proximal to the neck of the pseudoaneurysm to insure complete exclusion. Some opted for endovascular repair using a covered stent. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> However, covered stent placement to seal the pseudoaneurysm was not feasible in our case, as it originated from a distal branch. A US-guided thrombin injection was not available at the time of intervention, although it could also have been considered a treatment option.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】Following THA, pseudoaneurysm of the PFA is quite rare. Early identification and treatment are made possible by knowledge of this consequence and a high degree of suspicion, particularly in redo surgeries. Since it is simpler to reach the deep femoral artery branches and less intrusive than open surgical repair, the endovascular repair was the authors’ method of choice in this situation.

Findings on ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI) led to a presumptive diagnosis of a 1.5 cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the right posterior lobe of the liver. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation of the tumor were attempted. After 2 months, CT scan and EOB-MRI showed that the tumor had enlarged to 3 cm. Positron emission tomography (PET) confirmed abnormal metabolic activity with a high standardized uptake value of 7.3 in the lesion. These findings could indicate malignancy such as well-differentiated HCC or cholangiocarcinoma or a benign lesion such as hepatic abscess. Histopathological examination of a liver biopsy revealed a granuloma with many inflammatory cells, leading to a diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. We report a rare case of hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor with enhancement on EOB-MRI and increased uptake on PET, mimicking HCC.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) is a rare benign tumor that may develop in various organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, IPT of the liver is very rare and is often accompanied by fever, malaise, and abdominal pain. Due to the lack of characteristic clinical and radiological features for diagnosis, IPT may be mistaken as malignant tumor such as cholangiocarcinoma, or liver abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In particular, IPT may be a vascular-rich tumor demonstrating radiological findings similar to those of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In a patient with risk factors for HCC, such as chronic viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, the presence of IPT may be misdiagnosed as HCC, and a correct diagnosis is established only by biopsy or surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. This lesion is usually diagnosed clinically or by conventional imaging methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Clinical diagnosis is difficult in patients with nonspecific symptoms and no serological evidence of inflammation. Laparoscopy and/or open hepatectomy are often performed unnecessarily under a misdiagnosis of HCC or cholangiocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Hence, diagnosis of IPT by percutaneous needle biopsy is important to avoid unnecessary exploratory laparotomy or hepatectomy. Unfortunately, needle biopsy does not always rule out malignancy or provide a definitive diagnosis of IPT of the liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. There are a few reports of hepatic IPT diagnosed by fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We herein report a case of IPT of the liver in a patient with cirrhosis, with imaging features mimicking HCC.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 71-year-old Japanese man was referred to our out-patient clinic in 2012 for investigation of a 1.5-cm liver mass and adenomyomatosis of gallbladder, which were detected incidentally by ultrasonography (US).\n\n【7】The patient had no history of medication. Physical examination was normal. No stigmata for chronic liver disease was identified. Superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. The lungs were normal on auscultation. A chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram were normal. The results of biochemical analysis of the blood were total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.2–1.2); direct bilirubin, 0.1 mg/dL (normal range: 0.0–0.2); aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 45 IU/L (normal range: 10–40); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 50 IU/L (normal range: 5–45); alkaline phosphatase, 419 IU/L (normal range: 100–325); γ\\-guanosine triphosphate, 242 IU/L (normal range: <30), CEA, 4.1 ng/mL (normal range: <5.0); CA19-9, 23.2 U/mL (normal range: <37.0); alpha fetoprotein (AFP), 11.3 ng/mL (normal range: <10.0); protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonists-II (PIVKA-II), 11 ng/mL (normal range: <10.0). His daily alcohol intake was over 80 g for 40 years. Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e-antigen, and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative.\n\n【8】Ultrasonography reviewed a lesion in the liver, which was isoechoic to surrounding parenchyma. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 1.5-cm mass in the right posterior lobe of the liver, with contrast enhancement in early phase and washout with rim enhancement in delayed phase, together with definite findings of cirrhosis such as loss of hepatic volume or hypertrophy of the left liver and caudate lobe. The imaging findings thus indicate cirrhosis with IPT. The etiology might be alcoholic liver injury judging from his alcohol intake (over 80 g daily for 40 years). In MRI examination, the tumor was isodense on T1-weighted image and partially round and hyperintense on T2-weighted image. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (EOB-MRI) was performed. In the arterial phase following contrast injection, the center of the tumor was enhanced intensely and homogeneously. In the delayed phase and hepatobiliary phase, the tumor was completely washed out , similar to findings in malignant tumors. It was difficult or impossible to differentiate IPT from HCC on EOB-MRI. The mass was clinically diagnosed as an HCC according to the 2008 guidelines of Japanese Society of Hepatology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. We attempted transcatheter arterial infusion of iopamiron and observed nodules in the right posterior lobe of the liver . We next attempted transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with lipiodol (2 mL) plus epirubicin (20 mg) and miriplatin (70 mg) plus lipiodol (2 mL) plus porous gelatin particles (Gelpart). After TACE, partial lipiodol accumulation was observed. Moreover, we attempted radiofrequency ablation (RFA).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | MR images of hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor.

MRI revealed that the mass was entirely hypointense on a plain T1-weighted image and hyperintense on plain T2-weighted image. On EOB-MRI, the tumor was enhanced intensely and homogeneously in arterial phase and entirely hypointense in the delayed phase and hepatobiliary phase . An FDP-PET scan confirmed abnormal metabolic activity with a high standardized uptake value of 7.3 in the lesion. We attempted percutaneous needle biopsy to differentiate between HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, metastatic liver tumor, and liver abscess. Histologically, the tumor consisted of infiltrated inflammatory cells comprising lymphoplasma cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils in a background of stroma composed of interlacing bundles of myofibroblasts and collagen bundles . The surrounding liver parenchyma showed no evidence of cirrhosis. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive staining for CD10 , SMA, and CD34 and negative staining for CD117. There was no immunostaining for IgG4 in the entire liver tissues. There were no findings of HCC.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | MR images obtained approximately two months after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation.

Discussion\n\n【18】Certain bacteria including Escherichia coli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, Staphylococcus aureus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, and Gram-positive cocci 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> have been proposed as the causative agents of IPT of the liver. Based on the imaging findings, IPT is sometimes misdiagnosed as a malignant tumor such as HCC, cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) or metastatic liver cancer, or liver abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 14\\]</u>. It is important to diagnose IPT by liver biopsy because the tumor can be cured by medical treatments including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In the present case, liver biopsy of the hepatic mass showed extensive infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils as well as fibrosis, suggesting IPT. Therefore, we first treated the patient with antibiotics for one week.\n\n【19】The IPT in our case was histologically composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and fibroblastic cells. Someren 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> classified IPT of the liver into three types: (i) hyalinized sclerosing; (ii) xanthogranuloma; (iii) plasma cell granuloma subtypes. However, previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> showed that histological appearance did not correlate with the disease stage and that these various morphological features were observed to some extent simultaneously even in the same case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. It has been speculated that the differences between these histological subtypes might reflect varying disease processes or periods. However, the presence of neutrophils in IPT has not been described. Strictly speaking, therefore, the present case cannot be classified into any of the subtypes. Although the tumor in our case cannot be strictly diagnosed as classical IPT of the liver, it is consistent with the broad diagnostic criteria.\n\n【20】Recently, IPT can be classified pathologically into two types: fibrohistiocytic and lymphoplasmacytic, from IgG4-related disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Fibrohistiocytic IPT is characterized by xanthogranulomatous inflammation, multinucleated giant cells, and neutrophilic infiltration and occurs predominantly in the peripheral hepatic parenchyma as mass-forming lesion. In contrast, lymphoplasmacytic IPT shows diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and prominent eosinophilic infiltration and is found exclusively around the hepatic hilum. In addition, venous occlusion with little inflammation and cholangitis without periductal fibrosis are frequently observed in the fibrohistiocytic type, whereas obliterative phlebitis and cholangitis with periductal fibrosis are common features of the lymphoplasmacytic type. Interestingly, IgG4-positive plasma cells are significantly more numerous in the lymphoplasmacytic than fibrohistiocytic type. Immunohistochemically, our case showed IgG-negative plasma cells and may be classified into the fibrohistiocytic type.\n\n【21】In the present case, findings observed in the liver biopsy, especially the focal CD10 positivity and neutrophilic infiltration, may suggest changes secondary to previous treatment. Heat injuries by RFA involving adjacent organs and Glisson’s sheaths have been reported to cause complications such as cholecystitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In our case, hepatocellular damage from cirrhosis and RFA/TACE treatment might have given rise to the IPT or caused enlargement of the IPT.\n\n【22】In conclusion, this paper reports for the first time the EOB-MRI and FDP-PET findings of IPT of the liver, which is difficult to differentiate from malignant tumor. In addition, our case may be a rare case of enlargement of hepatic IPT induced by TACE or/and RFA. IPT should be suspected when treatment for a suspected liver lesion, whether it is HCC or abscess, does not produce expected response.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": null, "finished": false, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-20 01:31:17"}

Case Report\n\n【5】The case was a 49-year-old man presenting to the emergency department for a vegetative inguinoscrotal lesion increasing in size for 1 year. On clinical examination, the lesion was purulent, painless, with well-defined irregular contours, and a warty surface, resembling a cauliflower, measuring 6 × 5 mm on the left and 4 × 3 cm on the right . There was bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Inguinoscrotal exophytic lesion with a warty surface giving a cauliflower appearance.</u>\n\n【7】A biopsy of the tumor was performed, and the anatomopathological study showed a very well-differentiated squamous cell tumor proliferation with an exophytic and endophytic tumor architecture bordered by hyperkeratosis and parakeratosic epidermis in favor of a verrucous-type carcinoma .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Pathological examination showing a very well-differentiated squamous cell tumor proliferation with an exophytic and endophytic tumor architecture bordered by hyperkeratosis and parakeratosic epidermis.</u>\n\n【9】Inguinoscrotal MRI was performed for local invasion before surgery. It showed a bilateral exo- and endophytic inguinoscrotal tumor with intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted images with contrast enhancement and restricted diffusion . The left epididymal head was invaded.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Inguinoscrotal MRI showing the exo- and endophytic inguinoscrotal tumor with intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences ((a), arrow) enhanced ((b), star) with diffusion restriction (c).</u>\n\n【11】Surgical excision of the tumor with left orchidectomy was performed. Extemporaneous examination of inguinal lymphadenopathies confirmed their metastatic nature, followed by the inguinal lymph node dissection. The surgical wound was closed with a scrotal flap. Resection margins were negative according to the anatomopathological examination. At a follow-up 18 months later, the clinical examination was quite normal, and there was no tumor recurrence.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Scrotal verrucous carcinoma is a rare entity, first described by Ackerman in 1948 as a variant of squamous cell carcinoma, characterized by exophytic growth without infiltration of the basal membrane with a locally invasive but rarely metastatic development, especially in lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Human papillomaviruses (HPV) types 6 and 11 would have a significant role in the pathogenesis of verrucous carcinoma. However, some studies have not found an association between these tumors and HPV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Clinically, the tumor has a budding, cauliflower appearance, sometimes associated with a superficial, foul-smelling ulceration.\n\n【16】The relationship between Buschke–Lowenstein tumor or giant acuminate condyloma and verrucous carcinoma remains unclear. Some authors consider them two progressive forms of the same disease, while others as separate diseases. Whatever the relationship between these two conditions, their treatment is identical, primarily requiring surgery. Verrucous carcinoma is not related to HPV infection. It is locally aggressive, with possible metastatic potential, and therefore has a poor prognosis. Lowenstein tumor has a low rate of recurrence which carries a good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The biopsy with anatomopathological study confirms the diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma, showing hyperplasia with hyperacanthosis, papillomatosis, and sometimes hyperkeratosis surface. Epithelial buds push back the underlying chorion, respecting the basement membrane. Imaging provides a local extension in order to guide the surgical procedure.\n\n【18】Ultrasound shows the tumor extension to the spermatic cord, epididymis, testicles, and penis. The lesion can be iso- or hypoechoic, well defined, with irregular contours, vascularized at color Doppler.\n\n【19】Magnetic resonance imaging is more sensitive for evaluating the locoregional extension of the tumor and for looking for lymphadenopathy. Scrotal verrucous carcinoma is hypointense on T1 WS, with intermediate signal intensity on T2 WS, with contrast enhancement and restricted diffusion.\n\n【20】Surgical excision with lymph node dissection (in case of associated metastatic lymph nodes) is the standard treatment; it must be wide enough to have negative resection margins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The prognosis is relatively good, but local recurrences are frequent. This justifies clinical monitoring every 4 months during the first year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then every year with a clinical examination supplemented by ultrasound, fine needle aspiration, and screening smear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】Scrotal verrucous carcinoma is a rare mucosal skin disorder. The clinical appearance of the tumor is suggestive, but the positive diagnosis is based on a biopsy with histological study. Imaging is important for local and regional tumor extension.

Our patient presented with a red, tortuous migratory rash with localized pruritus on the left plantar foot of 1-month duration. He lacked recent travel history outside the southeastern United States. Upon admission, he presented with peripheral blood eosinophilia, an uncommon feature of HrCLM. A single dose of ivermectin was sufficient for treatment, and symptoms resolved within 3 days. This case highlights the increased incidence of domestically acquired hookworm infections, explores this epidemiological shift, and emphasizes relevant differential diagnoses.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】An estimated 500 million individuals in developing tropical and subtropical countries are infected with hookworms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Unlike the human hookworms, the dog hookworm, Ancylostoma braziliense, and cat hookworm, A. caninum, do not intentionally target humans. However, they can incidentally infect humans percutaneously, and this zoonotic parasitic infestation results in hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. HrCLM classically presents as an erythematous, slightly raised, serpiginous or linear skin lesion that migrates within the epidermis. The phenomenon is known as a “creeping eruption” or “creeping dermatitis” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】A. braziliense and A. caninum reside in the gastrointestinal tracts of dogs and cats. Their eggs are expelled in animal feces and deposited in the soil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The consequent infective larvae can penetrate the corneal layer of the epidermis on any areas of exposed human skin that come into contact with contaminated soil. This typically occurs through the soles of individuals walking barefoot outside. Common sources of infection include beaches, sandboxes, and crawl spaces under dwellings, but any soil that may come in contact with animal droppings can be a potential reservoir 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The larvae produce hyaluronidase and a protease that allows their intradermal passage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. They cannot further develop in their incidental human host and are stuck migrating aimlessly within the epidermis until the larvae die. Consequently, HrCLM is innately self-limiting and resolves in as little as a few weeks to as long as a year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】HrCLM is one of the most common infectious diseases of international travelers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Historically, it has been attributed to travel to tropical and subtropical developing countries of Asia, Africa, and the Americas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, A. braziliense and A. caninum are also endemic to the southeastern United States, notably along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The increasing incidence of these infections in the southern United States may be a result of recent climate change, as these parasites thrive in warm, sandy conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. As cases of local soil transmission of hookworms rise, it is imperative that clinicians in the West be alert to identifying and differentiating this zoonotic parasite from other conditions with similar presentations, such as Löffler syndrome and DRESS syndrome, that bear considerably greater morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A well-appearing male in his twenties with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department initially for an erythematous rash that tracked proximally up his left arm, as well as left arm numbness and paraesthesias, following trauma to his left hand 2 weeks prior. He was admitted to the hospital for possible cellulitis with acute lymphangitic spread.\n\n【8】During admission, the patient noted a second rash on the medial aspect of his left plantar foot that had appeared 1-month prior. The erythematous lesion was serpiginous, intensely pruritic, and frequently changed locations overnight. He tried topical antibiotic ointment and hydrogen peroxide on the area without improvement.\n\n【9】The patient lived at home with his dogs and stray cats. He was a roofer by trade and frequently came into contact with sand and soil while working with construction materials. He wore “flip-flops” sandals on occasion but denied walking outside barefoot. He also denied going to the beach, local water springs, or any recent travel. The patient did not endorse any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, headaches, or changes in vision. He was uncertain of the last Tdap immunization and reported no IV drug use.\n\n【10】On examination, multiple traumatic lesions with pustules and bullae were present on his hands bilaterally. The left hand displayed a large blood-filled blister on the medial wrist with surrounding erythema that radiated proximally toward his left arm. His left plantar foot exhibited an erythematous tortuous lesion with a migrating track adjacent to an approximately 4 cm patch of erythema with a central scab and bullae . All the other examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The site of the injury on the plantar surface of the foot displaying linear open bullae, serpiginous rash, and surrounding erythema.</u>\n\n【12】On the day of admission, laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cells (15.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L; reference range 4.0–10 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), C-reactive protein (22.69 mg/dL; reference range 0–5 mg/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (32 mm/hour; reference range 0–10 mm/hour). His overall eosinophil count was within normal limits (0.14 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L; reference range 0.03–0.46 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), but his eosinophils occupied a high proportion of total white cells (15%). No skin biopsy, stool testing, or chest X-ray was performed.\n\n【13】##### 2.1. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【14】The differential diagnosis of a man in his late twenties presenting with a 1-month history of a migratory serpiginous rash with associated pruritus includes HrCLM, larva currens of strongyloidiasis, gnathostomiasis, and scabies.\n\n【15】The rash of HrCLM is red, well-defined, persistent, and slowly migrates at a rate of 1–2 cm/day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. When suspecting a HrCLM, the main condition that must be ruled out is larva currens, the migrating rash of the human nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. In comparison to HrCLM, the rash of larva currens is pink, less defined, evanescent, and rapidly migrates at a rate of 5–15 cm/hour. The lower trunk, buttocks, and thighs are commonly affected. Larva currens also presents with marked urticaria, systemic symptoms, GI manifestations, peripheral eosinophilia, and stool positive for larvae of S. stercoralis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Gnathostomiasis is caused by the larvae of Gnathostoma spp. migrating through subcutaneous tissues. It can present as a creeping eruption with intermittent, migratory swellings of the trunk and upper extremities. However, gnathostomiasis is a food-borne parasite that often follows ingestion of raw or contaminated seafood or travel to endemic countries of Southeast Asia, Central, or South America 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Scabies represents the cutaneous manifestation of a Sarcoptes scabiei mite infection. Scabies presents as intensely pruritic linear or serpiginous burrows in multiple areas, commonly the interdigital spaces of the hand, wrists, intertriginous areas, and genitalia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【18】##### 2.2. Treatment and Outcome\n\n【19】Our patient was diagnosed with hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) and treated with a single dose of ivermectin 200 μg/kg.\n\n【20】The left-hand clinical picture of trauma and erythema quickly streaking up the left arm combined with a white blood cell count of 15.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L prompted a clinical suspicion of cellulitis with acute lymphangitic spread. The patient completed antibiotics and received a Tdap vaccine booster.\n\n【21】The patient’s creeping dermatitis and pruritus of the left plantar foot resolved within 3 days. At that time, he was discharged to go home.\n\n【22】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【23】Our case demonstrates a classic presentation of HrCLM acquired domestically in the southeastern United States. As our patient lacked recent travel history, he was likely exposed while wearing flip flops on the ground around his home that had been soiled by his dogs and cats. Alternatively, since he worked in roofing, he may have been exposed to contaminated soil while handling building materials on the job. Traditionally, HrCLM has been associated with travel to sandy beaches that are contaminated with the filariform larvae of animal feces. Indigenous cases of HrCLM in patients without a history of travel have been increasingly reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Much attention has been given to the effects of global warming on the incidence of human helminth infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Warmer climates and increased rainfall increase the tropical and subtropical zones on the global map and foster ideal conditions for the life cycle of A. braziliense and A. caninum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Therefore, climate change may be contributing to an increased incidence of domestically acquired animal hookworm infections and should be a continued area of interest for researchers.\n\n【24】The diagnosis was made clinically. No skin biopsy or stool testing was performed. Skin biopsies are rarely diagnostic of HrCLM since the larvae are typically located 1–2 cm ahead of the visible lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In our case, the classical clinical picture strongly suggested the diagnosis of HrCLM without the need for further testing. However, in cases with less clear clinical pictures, testing for S. stercoralis antibodies and larvae in stool would be helpful to rule out the diagnosis of larva currens of strongyloidiasis.\n\n【25】Our patient is notable in that he presented with peripheral eosinophilia of 15%. In a study of 98 German travelers with HrCLM, 20% of the 40 individuals tested presented with eosinophilia >7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. While our patient presented with peripheral eosinophilia, he did not report any respiratory symptoms or display any signs of pulmonary distress, so a chest X-ray was not performed. However, HrCLM can present in a self-limited disseminated form called Löffler syndrome (pulmonary eosinophilia), characterized by an immediate onset of peripheral eosinophilia, transient pulmonary infiltrates, and respiratory symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Löffler syndrome can be seen following infection by hookworms as well as Ascaris lumbricoides and S. stercoralis. In cases of Löffler syndrome, the differential diagnosis must include drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome with pulmonary manifestation, as these two conditions can present identically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. While Löffler syndrome is mild and self-limited, DRESS syndrome is severe and potentially fatal. DRESS syndrome is a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs 2–8 weeks after drug exposure (often allopurinol, anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, dapsone, and other antimicrobials) with a variable clinical presentation that can include high fever, malaise, skin eruption, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, and visceral organ involvement (commonly liver, kidney, and lungs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The skin rash is often the first clear manifestation of DRESS syndrome and often presents as a symmetric maculopapular rash involving >50% of the trunk and extremities that later coalesces with erythema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Mucosal involvement, pruritus, and facial edema may also occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Pulmonary involvement is rare but signifies a greater severity of the disease. When pulmonary involvement does occur, it most commonly presents with cough, shortness of breath, and interstitial infiltrates on imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Due to its nonspecific presentation, DRESS is referred to as a “great mimicker” and is a diagnosis of exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. With a mortality rate of 10%, DRESS syndrome is an important differential diagnosis to consider in any patient presenting with a rash 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Although HrCLM is self-limiting, pharmacological treatment of choice includes oral ivermectin 200 μg/kg once daily for 1–2 days or oral albendazole 400–800 mg once daily with a fatty meal for 3 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A similar case of HrCLM acquired in Florida was successfully treated with two doses of ivermectin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However, a single dose of oral ivermectin is sufficient for patients with HrCLM with creeping dermatitis, as in the case of our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Ivermectin acts on ligand-gated chloride channels in nematodes to induce paralysis and impede feeding and fertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Inconsistent results have been reported in patients treated with topical ivermectin 1% cream twice daily for two weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 21, 22\\]</u>. Interestingly, a recent report observed eradication of HrCLM in a patient treated with a low-dose ivermectin 0.1% cream twice daily for two weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Additionally, topical thiabendazole 10–15% ointments and albendazole may provide an alternative, albeit less potent, treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【28】In summary, HrCLM is a clinical diagnosis classically associated with international travel to tropical areas. However, cases of indigenous HrCLM are increasingly reported. This change in epidemiology may be partially attributed to changes in climate that have shifted the tropical landscape. Therefore, clinicians must keep this diagnosis as well as other similar clinical presentations in mind. If diagnosed promptly, this skin disease responds very well to pharmacological therapy, and often a single dose of ivermectin adequately resolves the infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:39:26", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:40:36", "cost": 70.181}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:40:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:39:25"}

A 73-year-old woman suffered a subtrochanteric fracture of the left femur . She had accompanying chronic renal failure and had been treated by hemodialysis for 40 years. The fracture was fixed with a second-generation gamma nail (Gamma APJ (Asia Pacific Japan) nail, Stryker, Japan) at a previous hospital; however, fracture reduction was not adequately achieved and a large gap remained between the fracture fragments . Ten months after the initial surgery, the gap was still evident demonstrating atrophic nonunion . Autologous bone grafting to the nonunion site was performed at the same hospital . Cancellous bone was harvested from the iliac crest and grafted. Two months after the second surgery, a breakage of the nail at the distal screw hole was observed and the grafted bone appeared to be absorbed .

We exchanged the original gamma nail with a long gamma nail (Long Gamma APJ nail, Stryker, Japan), and performed autologous bone grafting at the nonunion site . Cancellous bone was harvested from the iliac crest and grafted. The fresh fracture site healed uneventfully six months after the surgery, additionally the nonunion site obtained bony union nine months after the surgery .

Discussion\n\n【10】Breakage of a gamma nail is a relatively rare complication, and the reported incidence ranges from 0.2 to 5.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–9\\]</u>. The location of the nail breakage was reported mainly at the level of the aperture of the lag screw and at the distal screw hole, followed by the nail shaft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–9\\]</u>. In our case the nail breakage occurred at the distal screw hole.\n\n【11】The tragic chain of events in this case was caused by previous inappropriate surgery, which apparently caused the nail breakage. At the initial surgery, fracture reduction was not obtained and a large gap continued to exist between the fragments, however, the insertion of the nail was performed and interlocked with two distal screws. There was no bony contact between the fragments. The previous surgeon then performed autologous bone grafting to the fracture gap at the second surgery without revision of the implant. However replacement of the gamma nail was indicated when making attempts at gap reduction during the second surgery. Moreover, a long gamma nail was also indicated in the initial surgery because the fracture was in the subtrochanteric area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 10–12\\]</u>. No bony contact led to excessive stress to the hardware. Weight bearing was transmitted from the proximal fragment directly to the nail and the distal locking screw. Therefore, we suggest the nail broke due to metal fatigue at the location with the strongest stress.\n\n【12】Replacing the nail and autologous bone grafting was effective for salvage surgery. A longer nail was selected to fix the segmental fracture. A long gamma nail is commonly used for treatment of subtrochanteric fracture and its effectiveness has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 10–12\\]</u>. Additionally, Barquet et al. reported a good clinical result in the treatment of subtrochanteric nonunion with long gamma nails 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. We predicted the fresh fracture would heal by fixation; however, the nonunion site located above the fresh fracture site was long standing and thought to be biologically less active. Therefore, we supplemented with autologous bone grafting at the nonunion site.\n\n【13】Patient-dependent risk factors for nonunion include various medical comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, vascular disease), advanced age, smoking, alcohol abuse, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, nutritional deficiency, radiation treatment, genetic disorders, and metabolic disease or endocrine pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This patient had accompanying chronic renal failure and had been treated by hemodialysis for 40 years. There is no comprehensive study describing the relationship between nonunion and chronic renal failure/hemodialysis. However, Karaeminogullari et al. reported the high incidence of nonunion in surgically treated hip fractures in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. We cannot declare that the chronic renal failure/hemodialysis impaired the fracture healing, however, it is possible that the chronic renal failure/hemodialysis affected this patient’s fracture healing. This patient was 73-year-old; therefore the advanced age possibly affected the impaired fracture healing.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】We present a rare patient with breakage of gamma nail accompanied by nonunion of the original fracture and a subsequent new fracture in the ipsilateral femur. This case confirms our understanding that appropriate reduction and fixation is important in fracture surgery.

The preferred treatment of such hemorrhages is surgical clipping through craniotomy. There are few reports about endovascular coil embolization in such cases. We report such a case treated by endovascular embolization. A 35-year-old man, who had experienced 2 episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), was found to have a ruptured ID of the PCo-A by head computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). We performed stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization through a combined anterior and posterior circulation approach. Postembolization angiography showed absence of contrast filling of the ID of the PCo-A and nonleakage of the contrast agent. The patient recovered well with no complications. SAH recurrence was not recorded during the 1-year followup. The postoperative angiographic result was good. To our knowledge, this is the first case of hemorrhage due to ruptured ID of the PCo-A that was treated by such a technique.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

ID of the PCo-A was regarded as normal anatomical variants with a low risk of rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, with increasing reports of ruptured ID of the PCo-A, bleeding is also found to occur in cases of ID of the PCo-A. Aggressive treatment (i.e. surgical clipping) is preferred for most patients presenting with hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–6\\]</u>, but little is known about the endovascular treatment of this condition. We report a case of ruptured ID of the PCo-A successfully treated by endovascular embolization.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 35-year-old man was admitted with sudden onset of headache and vomiting. At admission, he was in relatively good condition. Hunt-Hess scale was grade III, and the GCS score was 13 at presentation. A CT scan of the head revealed SAH mainly in the right suprasellar cistern with a Fisher grade of 3 . Dehydration therapy was performed immediately. Nine hours after the onset of symptoms, the patient lapsed into a coma; Hunt-Hess grade progressed to IV, and the GCS score deteriorated to 8. A repeated head CT examination revealed rebleeding, acute hydrocephalus, hematocele at bilateral posterior horns of the lateral ventricle, and a Fisher grade of 4 . A CTA was performed together with a CT and revealed a conical expansion of the infundibulum at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery with a diameter of less than 3 mm. The thin right posterior communicating artery arose from the apex of the infundibulum. In addition, no aneurysm was noted in angiography (arrow in Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). DSA and 3-D reconstruction were then performed, and these findings were similar to those seen in the CTA (arrow in Figures 1(e), 1(f), and 1(g)). After these imagings, conservative treatments including dehydration therapy were administered to allow the reabsorption of SAH. Nimodipine was given for antivasospasm treatment. In the meantime, lumbar drainage was performed to drain bloody cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Diagnosis of ruptured ID of the PCo-A. (a, b) Two SAH images detected at an interval of 9 hours show that the bleeding points in both episodes of hemorrhage were centered around the origin of the right posterior communicating artery and that the suprasellar cistern, sylvian cistern, ambient cistern, and tentorial margin were involved. Blood entry into the ventricles and the presence of ventriculomegaly were seen in (b). (c, d) Head CTA showed that a funnel-shaped expansion with a diameter of less than 3 mm occurred at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery and was in conjunction with the thin right posterior communicating artery at its apex (arrow).

(h) Reexamination by head CT after 20 days of conservative treatment demonstrated that SAH was absorbed and the size of ventricles was normal. (i) The second DSA examination after 20 days of conservative treatment revealed that the funnel-shaped expansion still existed at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery and was in conjunction with the thin posterior communicating artery at its apex, similar to the results obtained by CTA and the first DSA (arrow). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】After 20 days of conservative treatment, the patient’s condition got better, and he could follow simple commands. A repeated head CT showed that SAH was reabsorbed, and the size of the ventricles became normal . DSA was performed again and yielded the same result as the previous one (arrow in Figure 1(i)). Thus, ruptured ID of the PCo-A was diagnosed, and we planned to perform coil embolization. Because of the wide neck of the ID, stent-assisted occlusion was required. As a result, clopidogrel and aspirin were administrated orally for one week.\n\n【8】At day 27 after the bleed, endovascular coil embolization was performed under general anesthesia. The right femoral artery was punctured using the Seldinger technique to introduce a vascular sheath. Heparin was administered. Vertebral angiography with carotid compression was performed before vascular embolization so as to observe the blood supply to the posterior circulation of the ID of the PCo-A. The result showed that blood flow reversed into the internal carotid artery through the posterior communicating artery . Subsequently, endovascular embolization of the ID of the PCo-A was conducted. After a suitable working angle was selected, a Neuroform3 stent (4.0 mm  ×  20 mm) was successfully released using an Echelon-14 microcatheter and Transend-300 microguidewire to completely cover the neck of the ID of the PCo-A. Subsequently, an Echelon-10 microcatheter was delivered into the ID of the PCo-A using Transend-300 microguidewire through the stent mesh. After angiography, a HydroCoil 10 coil (2 mm  ×  2 cm, MicroVention, Aliso Viejo, Calif) was released into the ID of the PCo-A. However, the coil was not detached due to the unfavorable location . The left femoral artery was punctured for introduction of a vascular sheath, and then an Echelon-10 microcatheter was placed into the PCo-A ID using a Transend-300 microguidewire via the posterior communicating artery . Four HydroCoil 10 coils were sequentially released (2 mm  ×  2 cm, 2 mm  ×  2 cm, 2 mm  ×1 cm, 2 mm  ×  1 cm) to fill the ID of the PCo-A . No enhancement of the ID of the PCo-A was shown in the angiography of anterior or posterior circulation, and leakage of the contrast agent did not occur . The coil placed in the internal carotid artery was detached . After catheters and sheaths were removed, the procedure was completed.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Endovascular coil embolization of ruptured ID of the PCo-A.

However, the prevalence of it on carotid angiography ranges from 5% to 17% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u> or even higher, as shown in other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. The natural history of ID of the PCo-A remains unclear; it is generally recognized as an anatomical variant resulting from incomplete retrogression of vessels during embryonic development. ID of the PCo-A usually does not rupture or bleed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 8\\]</u>. However, a number of studies have reported fatal SAH caused by ID of the PCo-A rupture or its progression to aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Hemorrhage due to the rupture of the ID of the PCo-A is surgically treated (i.e. surgical clipping) to prevent disastrous consequences due to rebleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 8, 12–20\\]</u>. In most IDs of the PCo-A, PCo-A is not well developed and has few perforating branches; so, the origin of the ID of the PCo-A is clipped in an orientation parallel to the internal carotid artery to prevent rebleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–18\\]</u>.\n\n【14】However, in our patient, although the right PCo-A was underdeveloped, neurosurgical clipping treatment was not selected, and stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization was performed using a combined approach of anterior and posterior circulation. This approach was considered because we found that the ID of the PCo-A had a wide junction with the internal carotid artery, making full clipping quite difficult similar to wide-necked aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Moreover, a previous study has shown that the bleeding points in the ruptured ID of the PCo-A were mostly located at the distal side of the ID, close to the internal carotid artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Under such circumstances, blood could still flow into the inside of the ID along the PCo-A even when the origin of the ID is clipped.\n\n【15】In the current study, enhancement of the PCo-A was not revealed in the DSA of posterior circulation, but it appeared in the angiography of the compressed internal carotid artery. Blood flowed reversely into the internal carotid artery  indicating the possibility of rebleeding if the neck of the ID was clipped and the ruptured bleeding point was left untreated. However, clipping the bleeding points of the ID of the PCo-A might result in new bleeding sites near the previous ones, due to the continuous impact of blood flow; there is also the probability that the ID of the PCo-A will progress to an aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 23\\]</u>. Therefore, at least 2 aneurysm clips are needed for isolation of the ID of the PCo-A in order to prevent rebleeding. It is difficult to place two aneurysm clips because of the narrow operating space around the posterior communicating artery. On the contrary, stent-assisted coil embolization by means of endovascular approach is relatively safe in comparison to neurosurgical clipping. Therefore, we preferred to perform endovascular treatment.\n\n【16】Although the patient experienced two SAH episodes in this study, the CTA on admission and first the DSA did not reveal the aneurysm but a conical expansion of the infundibulum at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery. At that time, ruptured ID of PCo-A could not be confirmed because profound SAH might have resulted in vasospasms that hide a very small aneurysm. In addition, the condition of the patient was critical. If we had attempted to treat the expansion of the infundibulum, disastrous result might have occurred or the aneurysm might have been missed. The better alternative was to wait until the blood was reabsorbed. After 20 days of conservative treatment, the repeated CT revealed reabsorption of blood along with an improvement in the condition of the patient. The DSA was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of ruptured ID of the PCo-A. Endovascular treatment lead to a good outcome. The follow-up DSA did not show the recurrence of ID of the PCo-A.\n\n【17】To date, no report on endovascular intervention treatment for ruptured ID of the PCo-A is available. We made an attempt to provide a new strategy for its treatment. While considering endovascular embolization for eligible patients with ID of the PCo-A, the following two factors need to be taken into account. First, the ipsilateral internal carotid artery needs to be compressed when conducting vertebral angiography so as to fully assess the hemodynamic status of the ID of the PCo-A. Therefore, rupture due to incomplete filling and blood supply from the posterior circulation can be prevented. Second, stent-assisted embolization is required because of the wide neck of the ID of the PCo-A. When full blocking is not possible through the internal carotid artery of the anterior circulation alone, it is preferable to carry out the blocking through the combined approach of anterior and posterior (via the posterior communicating artery) circulation.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】Stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization through a combined approach of anterior and posterior circulation provides a new strategy for treatment of hemorrhage due to rupture of the ID of the PCo-A.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:11:06", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:11:14", "cost": 8.621}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:11:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:11:06"}

He received radiation therapy to the thoracic spine and completed 2 cycles of CyBorD regimen (cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> by mouth, BTZ 1.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneous, and dexamethasone 40 mg by mouth each on days 1, 8, 15, and 22). Three days after the completion of the second cycle, he was admitted to hospital with respiratory distress. CT chest  showed new interval appearance of bilateral perihilar ground-glass opacities and peribronchial and interstitial thickening predominantly in the upper lobes not seen in prior scan . There were no other signs or symptoms of pneumonia such as leukocytosis, fever, or cough. After some benefit from oral prednisone, he was discharged with a tapering dose of the same. Unfortunately, the patient was readmitted with worsening respiratory distress 4 days later. A repeat CT scan of the chest showed resolution of previously well-defined areas of perihilar ground-glass opacities but development of hazy areas of ground-glass opacification throughout both lungs with more confluent abnormalities in bilateral lower lobes . The patient was treated with high-dose methylprednisone and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation without any improvement. The family requested do-not-resuscitate and do-not-intubate status. The patient died on the 10<sup>th</sup> day of the admission.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT chest showing new interval appearance of bilateral perihilar ground-glass opacities and peribronchial and interstitial thickening predominantly in the upper lobes.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Prior CT chest for comparison.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 A repeat chest CT showed resolution of previously well-defined areas of perihilar ground-glass opacities but development of hazy areas of ground-glass opacification throughout both lungs with more confluent abnormalities in bilateral lower lobes.</u>\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Methodology\n\n【12】We have reported a case and performed a review of current literature on BLI and statistical analysis of available data. Extensive PubMed search was performed to screen the literature using the search words “bortezomib” and “pulmonary injury,” “pulmonary toxicity,” “lung injury,” “lung toxicity,” “pneumonitis,” “pulmonary side effects,” “lung side effects,” “shortness of breath,” “breathlessness,” “dyspnea,” “ARDS,” or “respiratory failure.” BLI was defined as new onset of respiratory symptoms with new radiological finding without evidence of infection and other causes of respiratory symptoms including cardiac causes and other drug-related adverse effects. Respiratory symptoms included fever, dyspnea, cough, breathlessness, or respiratory failure. Radiological findings included any pulmonary infiltrate, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, ground-glass opacity, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, reticular shadowing, or features of pulmonary hypertension and interstitial pneumonitis. Eligible cases from the literature were included in the review.\n\n【13】#### 4\\. Results\n\n【14】An extensive PubMed search yielded 35 events of BLI, 5 of which occurred with readministration of BTZ after resolution of initial BLI. The mean (standard deviation SD, minimum, maximum) age is 61.14 years (9.93, 31, 78) and 65.71% were male. 14.29% had current or past smoking history, 17.24% had history of lung disease, and 31.43% had prior SCT for MM. 14.29% received steroid just prior to or along with bortezomib. 14.29% were receiving concurrent chemotherapy. The mean total BTZ dose was 4.41 mg (2.75, 1, 9), mean duration from the first dose to the onset of BLI was 20.59 days (16.59, 0.5, 60), and the mean duration from the last dose to onset of BLI was 3.08 days (2.77, 0, 10). 37.14% of BLIs were fatal.\n\n【15】The t\\-test showed no significant difference in mean age, mean number of BTZ doses, and mean duration from the 1<sup>st</sup> dose of BTZ to the onset of BLI between deceased and survivors. But, the difference in mean duration (SD, minimum, maximum) from the last dose of BTZ to the onset of BLI between deceased (1.59 days (SD, 0, 5)) and survivors (3.95 days (SD, 0, 10)) were found to be statistically significant  Table 1. 45.45% deceased had prior SCT compared to 11.11% deceased who had no stem cell transplant . No significant association could be found between the outcome of BLI and various factors like sex, previous lung diseases, history of smoking, concurrent/prior steroids, and treatment of BLI with steroids Table 2.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Comparison of age, total BTZ dose, time from first dose of BTZ, and time from last dose of BTZ between those who survived and those who died .</u>\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Outcome based on individual categorical variables: sex, new/relapsed/refractory type, prior SCT, smoking, previous lung injury, steroid just prior to BTZ, and concurrent chemotherapy .</u>\n\n【18】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Most of the adverse effects associated with bortezomib are mild to moderate and are generally manageable, including gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. BLI is a serious yet underappreciated adverse effect of BTZ associated with a high mortality rate of 37.14% as suggested by our analysis of reported cases available. Some initial case reports suggested a mortality rate as high as 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In one phase IV clinical study of 666 patients who had received bortezomib published by Narimatsu et al. 3.6% of pulmonary complications and 0.5% of total deaths were attributed to these complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Some studies have shown that genetic predisposition to BLI, especially with Japanese population, and history of prior SCT might be risk factors for BLI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9, 21\\]</u>. Some cases responded very well to steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, while others did not. Our patient responded to steroid to some extent and was discharged. He later presented with worsening pulmonary symptoms and died. It is important to establish the dose and duration of steroid for the patients who respond to therapy. For others who do not respond to steroid, there is a need to identify other mechanisms of BLI, so that appropriate treatment may be directed. Clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion for BLI, as it can be misjudged as other more common respiratory conditions. Appropriate supportive management along with steroids and immediate withdrawal of BTZ should be the primary management strategy.\n\n【20】Our study showed that fatal BLIs were associated with early onset after the last dose of BTZ (with mean 1.59 days vs. 3.95 days among nonfatal BLI) and with history of prior SCT. No significant association could be found between the outcome of BLI and various factors like sex, previous lung diseases, history of smoking, concurrent/prior steroid intake, concurrent steroid as a part of chemotherapy regimens, and steroid administered to treat BLI. Small sample size, retrospective nature of the study, and analysis of composite data from the reported cases in the PubMed are major limitations of the study.\n\n【21】Carfilzomib (CFZ) is an irreversible, second-generation selective proteasome inhibitor that is used to treat relapsed or refractory MM. In July 2012, the FDA granted approval of carfilzomib for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug and who have shown disease progression while on therapy or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. In the ASPIRE study (a phase III trial of CFZ plus lenalidomide (R) and dexamethasone (D) vs. RD only in relapsed MM) and the ENDEAVOR study (a phase III trial of CFZ plus D vs. bortezomib plus D in relapsed MM), there was slightly higher incidence of all-grade dyspnea in the CFZ arm compared to respective controls (29 versus 13 percent) and cough (25 versus 14 percent), but there were no BLI-like noninfectious progressive lung injuries reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. According to FDA-approved manufacturer’s prescribing information, carfilzomib was associated with development of pulmonary hypertension in 2% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Severe pulmonary hypertension (grade ≥ 3) was in less than 1%.\n\n【22】Based on our literature review, only 5 case reports of CFZ-associated noninfectious progressive lung injury have been identified. In one of the reported cases, the patient presented with dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and a dry cough after the second dose of CFZ which got worse with subsequent dose until CFZ was discontinued. A CT chest revealed diffuse bilateral ground-glass micronodular opacities and increased reticular markings. The pulmonary function test showed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect, with severely reduced diffusion capacity and desaturation to 84% on exertion. Symptoms and CT scan finding improved after oral prednisone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. In other case report, the patient developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. After a week, the patient developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and despite aggressive supportive care, the patient died after three weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. The third case report was also about fatal pulmonary hemorrhage after CFZ. The patient had developed acute dyspnea within 2-3 hours of first dose of CFZ, along with infiltrates on chest X-ray. Symptoms resolved after corticosteroid and bronchodilators along with resolution of X-ray finding next day. The patient was subsequently treated five scheduled doses without any problem. After about a month, when second cycle of CFZ was given, the patient again developed acute dyspnea, with no resolution of symptoms. The patient later died of pulmonary hemorrhage despite aggressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Recent case series reported one case of pulmonary hypertension after CFZ and other case of dyspnea with lung disease with pulmonary function test showing significantly decreased unadjusted diffusion capacity of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. With increasing use of CFZ, more information may emerge regarding the CFZ-associated lung injuries in future.\n\n【23】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】BLI is a serious condition with a mortality rate of 37.14%. Early onset of BLI from the last dose of BTZ and prior SCT can be the predictors of mortality. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. Limited data have emerged on the possible association of CFZ with various lung injuries. Clinicians should be mindful of this potentially fatal adverse effect of proteasome inhibitors like BTZ or CFZ.\n\n【25】#### Abbreviations\n\n| BTZ: | Bortezomib |\n| --- | --- |\n| BLI: | BTZ-induced lung injury |\n| SCT: | Stem cell transplant |\n| SD: | Standard deviation. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:06:51", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:07:14", "cost": 22.512}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:07:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:06:50"}

The pulmonary interstitium is most commonly affected but extrapulmonary involvement can occur in almost any other organ system. Such an involvement can occur with or without the presence of pulmonary involvement, but isolated extrapulmonary involvement has been noted only in around 10% of cases. Isolated splenomegaly is very rare and an uncommon presentation of sarcoidosis. It is clinically challenging because of the extensive differential diagnosis. Among the many considerations are hematologic malignancies, primary splenic or metastatic tumors, infiltrative disorders, inflammatory disorders, and infections. We hereby discuss an interesting case of a 40-year-old female with isolated splenic sarcoidosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology characterized by presence of noncaseating granulomas in the involved organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. While the pulmonary interstitium is most commonly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, extrapulmonary involvement can occur in almost any other organ system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> including the skin, eyes, and abdominal organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Such an involvement can occur with or without the presence of pulmonary involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Isolated extrathoracic sarcoidosis is reported in only 10% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Splenic involvement has been reported in about 40% cases of multisystem sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, but isolated splenic involvement in sarcoidosis without any radiographic or clinical pulmonary involvement is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, only 10 such cases of isolated splenic sarcoidosis have been reported in the current literature. Here, we present a case of a 40-year-old female presenting with constitutional symptoms found to have isolated splenomegaly with multiple hypodense splenic lesions and no other multisystem involvement.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A healthy, 40-year-old female born in the Dominican Republic living in the United States for past 20 years presented with a complaint of low-grade fevers with temperature max. of 100.2°F, night sweats, malaise, and fatigue for 6-week duration. The patient denied having any rash, exertional dyspnea, cough, or joint pains. She denied any recent travel, sick contacts, or recent changes in weight and appetite. She did not recall any significant occupational, chemical, or animal exposure. The patient also denied having any risk factors for HIV.\n\n【6】On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable spleen without other appreciable organomegaly. There was no tenderness, guarding, or rigidity. Her chest, cardiovascular, genital, neurologic, and extremities examinations were unremarkable. Initial laboratory studies revealed a leukocyte count of 15,000 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L with an absolute eosinophil count of 800 cells × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (normal <500 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). All the other parameters of the complete blood count and differential markers of renal and hepatic function including serum calcium were within normal limits. A chest radiograph failed to demonstrate any consolidation, effusion, or cardiomegaly. Abdominal ultrasound was done and was nondiagnostic. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed the presence of an enlarged spleen measuring 16 × 7 × 6 cm with multiple hypodense lesions . The liver was reported to be normal without any evidence of hepatomegaly. No lymphadenopathy was seen on the imaging studies.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a, b) CT scan of the abdomen showing presence of an enlarged spleen measuring 16 × 7 × 6 cm with multiple hypodense lesions.</u>\n\n【8】The patient’s systemic symptoms with splenomegaly with multiple hypodense splenic lesions raised high suspicion for a primary hematologic malignancy or a primary splenic tumor. Following a normal peripheral blood smear and a normal bone marrow examination, a full-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed. PET scan showed multiple hypermetabolic splenic lesions with an SUV of 13.0 and no pathologic uptake in any other organ or lymph nodes.\n\n【9】To establish a specific diagnosis, the patient underwent laparoscopic splenectomy. Histopathologic examination of the resected tissue showed multiple noncaseating granulomas with multiple histiocyte-consisting follicles . There was no central necrosis or evidence of polynuclear neutrophils. Special staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungus was negative. GMS was done and was negative. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels were checked and were found to be 75 units/L (normal 8–53 units/L). Detailed history failed to reveal any environmental or occupational exposure to beryllium and talc.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a, b) Low- and high-power slides showing multiple noncaseating granulomas with multiple histiocyte-consisting follicles and absence of central necrosis or evidence of polynuclear neutrophils.</u>\n\n【11】The patient failed to show any evidence of thoracic and other organ system involvement at the time of diagnosis. She did well after splenectomy with subsequent resolution of her systemic symptoms and normalization of her serum ACE levels over the next 3 months. She presented with erythema nodosum-like skin lesions after 6 months of her splenectomy. The skin lesions resolved spontaneously. She did not require any medical treatment for sarcoidosis. She continues to be asymptomatic without any evidence of thoracic and other organ system involvement 2 years after splenectomy.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Isolated splenomegaly with systemic symptoms is unusual and clinically challenging. Differential diagnoses can include hematologic malignancies, primary splenic or metastatic tumors, infiltrative splenic disorders like amyloidosis and Langerhans cell histiocytosis, inflammatory disorders like sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematous, and rheumatoid arthritis, and infections like tuberculosis, fungi, and parasites. Extrathoracic involvement, in particular in the liver and spleen, can be isolated without constitutional symptoms or systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Isolated splenic sarcoidosis is usually asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, though when present, abdominal pain, fever, malaise, and weight loss are the most common symptoms in the patients with sarcoidosis of spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Our patient presented with a complaint of low-grade fevers, night sweats, malaise, and fatigue for 6 weeks. Absence of multisystem involvement made amyloidosis and Langerhans cell histiocytosis unlikely. Splenomegaly in rheumatoid arthritis is often associated with neutropenia which was absent in our patient. Similarly, the absence of lymphadenopathy, negative bacterial and fungal blood cultures, negative AFB and GMS, negative interferon testing for tuberculosis and a negative travel history to the endemic areas for malaria and leishmaniasis made each of these acute infections highly unlikely.\n\n【14】Laboratory studies are usually nondiagnostic but might be characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia. A linear relationship has been reported between the serum ACE level and spleen size. However, cases with a normal ACE level have been reported. In our patient, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels were checked and were found to be 75 units/L (normal 8–53 units/L).\n\n【15】Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis can show nonspecific findings on imaging. CT, MRI, PET-CT, and CEUS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> have a great potential in the assessment of focal lesions in sarcoidosis. Hypoechoic and hyperechoic lesions but also isoechoic masses can be clearly highlighted after injecting the contrast agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In our patient, systemic symptoms with splenomegaly with multiple hypodense splenic lesions raised high suspicion for a primary hematologic malignancy or a primary splenic tumor. Following a normal peripheral blood smear and a normal bone marrow examination, PET scan was performed. PET scan showed multiple hypermetabolic splenic lesions and no pathologic uptake in any other organ or lymph nodes. Although splenic size and splenic lesions can be characterized by imaging, histopathologic examination is required for definitive diagnosis. PET-CT does not help in differentiation of malignant lesions from sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【16】To establish a specific diagnosis, we decided to proceed with laparoscopic splenectomy which on histopathologic examination of the resected tissue showed multiple noncaseating granulomas with multiple histiocyte-consisting follicles . There was no central necrosis or evidence of polynuclear neutrophils. Special staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungus was negative.\n\n【17】Patients with splenic sarcoidosis should also be evaluated for pulmonary and other organ system involvement at the time of diagnosis and subsequent follow-up. Immunosuppressive drugs like steroids, methotrexate, and azathioprine should be considered in patients with isolated splenic sarcoidosis when systemic symptoms are persistent. About 60% of all symptomatic patients are known to show spontaneous remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment and should be followed closely. Asymptomatic patients with isolated splenic involvement usually have a good prognosis without any medical therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Splenectomy should be considered in the patients with symptomatic splenomegaly not responding to immunosuppressive therapy, severe hypersplenism, as a prophylaxis for splenic rupture and for histopathologic examination in the cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, and there is a high suspicion of malignant involvement of the spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Splenectomy does not change the natural history of sarcoidosis, and patients can develop pulmonary and/or systemic sarcoidosis even after removal of the spleen.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】Sarcoidosis of the spleen, although rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the patients presenting with systemic symptoms and splenomegaly. Histologic examination of the spleen is necessary for establishing the diagnosis of splenic sarcoidosis. All the patients with an established diagnosis of isolated splenic sarcoidosis should be evaluated for thoracic and other organ system involvement at the time of diagnosis and at subsequent follow-up. Immunosuppressive therapy should be reserved only for symptomatic patients with splenic sarcoidosis who fails to resolve spontaneously.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:41:37", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:41:47", "cost": 10.474}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:41:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:41:36"}

Giant cell tumors (GCTs) of bone are known for their local aggressiveness and high recurrence rate. There are rare cases of multicentric GCT and most are synchronous. We herein review metachronous multicentric GCT reported in the literature. Material and Methods. A MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Google Scholar search was done to collect all cases of multicentric metachronous GCT specifying the clinical, radiological, and histological characteristics of each location and its treatment. Results. A total of 37 multifocal giant cell tumors were found in the literature. 68% of cases of multicentric giant cell tumors occur in less than 4 years following treatment of the first lesion. Thirty-seven cases of multifocal metachronous GCT were identified in the literature until 2012. Patients with multicentric GCT tend to be younger averaging 23. There is a slight female predominance in metachronous GCT. The most common site of the primary GCT is around the knee followed by wrist and hand and feet. Recurrence rate of multicentric GCT is 28.5%. Conclusion. Multicentric giant cell tumor is rare. The correct diagnosis relies on correlation of clinical and radiographic findings with confirmation of the diagnosis by histopathologic examination.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Giant cell tumors (GCTs) of bone are known for their local aggressiveness and high recurrence rate. Patients with GCT present with nonspecific symptoms including pain, overlying soft-tissue swelling, and decreased range of motion at the adjacent joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】They rarely metastasize to distant structures such as the lung, although these metastases generally have the same benign histologic appearance as the index tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Even rarer are cases of multicentric giant cell tumor. Most multicentric giant cell tumors are synchronous, that is, occurring within a poorly defined time of the initial tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】In this paper, we present the case of a metachronous giant cell tumor as well as a review of the literature of metachronous multicentric giant cell tumor.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】An 18-year-old female presented to our institution with inflammatory right elbow pain and elbow stiffness. X-rays showed a lucent image on the medial aspect of the right distal humeral metaphysis with a radiologically intact cortex . Histological diagnosis of GCT was made on open biopsy. Extensive curettage was undertaken, phenol was applied on the walls of the remaining cavity as well as high-speed burring, and the cavity was filled with methyl methacrylate, with a satisfying result.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | AP view of the elbow with radiolucent lesion of the medial condyle. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】Four years later, X-rays showed involvement of the lateral condyle and MRI articular involvement. The diagnosis of recurrent GCT was confirmed on biopsy. A total marginal excision of the elbow joint was undertaken along with prosthetic elbow arthroplasty. Three years following the surgery, the patient was free of tumor and pain but had an unstable elbow due to prosthetic dislocation, but she said that she was satisfied with the result and refused revision surgery.\n\n【10】She was then lost to followup and came back only 7 years later, at the age of 32, after a fall from the stairs with pain around the left hip persisting for several weeks despite a regular use of anti-inflammatories and pain killers. Pelvic radiographs showed a lucent lesion of the left iliac bone . MRI showed active lytic process occupying the left iliac wing without cortical or joint involvement. PET-CT scan showed a high uptake of left iliac wing (6.8 SUV uptake) with no other involvement sites. Parathyroid hormone levels were normal. Biopsy confirmed GCT. She was operated on with curettage, application of phenol and alcohol, and methyl methacrylate. Followup after two years was clinically and radiologically unremarkable and a chest CT scan one year later showed no lung metastases.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | AP view of the pelvis showing a lucent lesion of the supra-acetabular area of the left iliac bone. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】#### 3\\.

Clinical characteristics of each case, involvement sites, radiographic findings, treatment modalities, and recurrences were recorded .\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Analysis of all metachronous multicentric GCT.</u>\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Results \n\n【16】A total of 37 cases of multifocal metachronous GCT were identified until 2012. There were 15 (40%) male and 22 (60%) female patients. Average age at diagnosis of the first GCT was 23 years.\n\n【17】The site of first involvement was in the upper extremity in 16 cases: 4 in the distal ulna, 4 in the distal radius, 5 in the humerus (4 proximal and 1 distal), and 3 in the hand, and in the lower extremity in 19 patients: 7 in the distal femur, 7 in the proximal tibia, 3 in the proximal fibula, and 2 in the foot. One patient had the first tumor in the pelvis and another one in the sphenoidal bone.\n\n【18】For the 2nd metachronous location of the GCT, 12 cases were in the upper limb: 7 in the humerus (4 proximal and 3 distal), 2 in the radius (1 proximal and 1 distal), 2 in the proximal ulna, and 1 in the hand. 11 cases were in the lower limb: 3 in the femur (1 proximal and 2 distal), 6 in the tibia (6 proximal and 1 distal), and 1 in the foot. In 7 metachronous tumors, the second location was in the trunk: 1 in the spine, 4 in the pelvis, and 2 in the skull. There were 7 metachronous GCTs in 2 or more locations: 1 in the proximal tibia and acetabulum, 1 in the ipsilateral proximal femur and proximal tibia, 1 in the ipsilateral proximal femur and fibula, 1 in the distal tibia and sacrum, 1 in the left proximal femur and right iliac wing, 1 in right foot, left fibula, right radius, and lung, and 1 in the pelvis, skull, and lung.\n\n【19】There was a 3rd metachronous location of the GCT in 11 patients (30%) and a 4th one in 2 patients (5%). 11 patients (28.5%) had a recurrence of their initial GCT at the same location. The mean duration separating the 2 locations of the metachronous multifocal tumors was 74.5 months.\n\n【20】The treatment used for the first location(s) of the GCT was resection of the tumor in 11 cases (29.7%), curettage with bone graft in 16 patients (43.6%), curettage alone in 1 patient (2.7%), curettage with PMMA in 2 patients (5.4%), curettage with cryotherapy in 1 patient (2.7%), amputation in 3 cases (8.1%), radiotherapy in 2 cases (5.4%), and unknown in 1 case (2.7%).\n\n【21】On an average 73-month followup, 20 patients (54%) suffering from multifocal metachronous GCT were disease-free, 8 patients (22%) still had a tumor in 1 or more locations but were asymptomatic, 2 patients (5%) died from the disease and its complications, and 7 patients (19%) were lost to followup.\n\n【22】Overall, 3 patients had metastases in the lung at the final followup: 2 as a second location and 1 as a 4th location. The 3 patients died from this complication. The mean lapse of time between the first and second locations of the GCT is 10 months.\n\n【23】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【24】Giant cell tumors are typically lesions of young and middle-aged adults, with 80% of tumors occurring in patients between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and a peak prevalence in the third decade of life. They account for 4% to 5% of primary bone tumors. Multifocal GCTs are rare. Approximately 1% of cases present as multiple synchronous or metachronous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Most multifocal GCTs are synchronous and 68% of cases of multicentric giant cell tumor occur in less than 4 years from the initial lesion treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. They have a more aggressive course, including an increased incidence of pathologic fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【25】There is a slight female predominance in metachronous GCT (57% versus 43%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> but not a 2 : 1 ratio as reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. We have found a 3 : 2 female : male ratio in this study. GCT occurs between the 3rd and 5th decades of life and >80% of patients are more than 25 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 23\\]</u>. However, patients with multicentric GCT tend to be younger averaging 23 with more than 70% aged 25 years old or younger at the time of initial diagnosis. The youngest patient reported with multicentric is 10 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The etiology of multifocal GCT is unclear: de novo formation or a metastatic phenomenon. Solitary benign GCTs may metastasize to the lung or undergo malignant transformation (either de novo or following irradiation); however, pathologic analysis of multifocal GCT reveals findings identical to histologically benign solitary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This suggests that the multifocality of some GCT is not a metastatic phenomenon but rather represents the separate development of the tumor at multiple sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Iatrogenic seeding may represent a cause of multicentric giant cell tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The most common site of the primary GCT is around the knee (44%), followed by wrist (23%) and hand and feet (13%), and is consistent with localization of solitary GCT. Diaphyseal involvement is more found in multifocal than in solitary GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Some studies suggested that GCTs of hand and feet are more likely to have a more aggressive course (17% in multicentric GCT compared to 2% in solitary GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>). They recommended a skeletal survey for these tumors as well as multiple followups to detect metachronous GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Recurrence rate of multicentric GCT is 28.5% and is comparable to the 35% recurrence rate of solitary GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 23\\]</u>. Pulmonary metastasis in solitary GCT occurs in less than 2% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In multicentric multifocal GCT, it occurs more frequently and averages around 8%.\n\n【29】In general, multicentric giant cell tumor is histologically indistinguishable from solitary giant cell tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 23\\]</u> and has the following characteristics: large vascular lacunae separated by septa in which numerous giant cells are found and filled with clotted blood (blood-filled spaces with bland fibrous connective tissue septa). These cavernous spaces vessels lack walls and normal features of blood vessels and stroma is formed of histiocytes, fibroblasts, scattered giant cells, hemosiderin, and occasional inflammatory cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Differential diagnosis for multicentric giant cell tumors includes brown tumor, Paget’s disease, osteomyelitis, fibrous dysplasia, giant cell reparative granuloma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, osteosarcoma, hematopoietic malignant tumor, and metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 23\\]</u>. Before a diagnosis of multicentric giant cell tumor can be made, it is necessary to rule out the presence of hyperparathyroidism, which can produce features of a polyostotic osteolytic lesion that are virtually identical to those of a giant cell tumor of bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Limitations to this review are that only case reports are available and many patients were lost to subsequent followup to uniform the population.\n\n【31】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【32】In summary, multicentric giant cell tumor is rare and most commonly affects long bones, particularly those around the knee. It tends to occur in younger patients and frequently manifests as synchronous lesions. In addition, lesions of multicentric giant cell tumor may have an unusual metaphysodiaphyseal location. Virtually all tumors have areas with typical histopathologic features of giant cell tumor. As in solitary giant cell tumor, the most aggressive behavior of the vast majority of multicentric giant cell tumors is local recurrence, especially in multicentric metachronous GCT of hand and feet, although there have been rare cases of metastasis to the lungs. Because a variety of other primary bone lesions may also have a polyostotic presentation, the correct diagnosis relies on correlation of clinical and radiographic findings with confirmation of the diagnosis by histopathologic examination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:01:10", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:01:31", "cost": 21.324}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:01:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:01:09"}

Similar cases from the literature are reviewed and speculation about the relationship of these diseases is offered. Although the occurrence of these diseases together could be coincidental, an association seems immunologically plausible. Thus, relapsing polychondritis might be an unusual systemic manifestation of alopecia areata.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Alopecia areata affects 1% to 2% of the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It has been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, including thyroid disorders, vitiligo, and possibly atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Case reports have suggested an association with myasthenia gravis, diabetes mellitus, Addison disease, and even common variable immunodeficiency, amongst others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Twice previously, alopecia areata and relapsing polychondritis have been reported in the same patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u> We wish to report a third case.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 71-year-old retired welder with a 28-year history of alopecia universalis developed poison ivy on the right forearm. Three weeks later, after complete healing of the poison ivy, the patient noted pain, redness, and tenderness of his right ear. The earlobe was spared. Shortly thereafter, the patient's nose became red and tender, and his left ear developed similar changes . He was treated with antibiotics with no improvement. Because of severe, persistent inflammation of the cartilage of both ears and his nose, a diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis was considered. One week later, prednisone therapy was begun at a dose of 40 mg per day. Prompt resolution of his signs and symptoms occurred. One month later, as prednisone therapy was being tapered, the patient developed hoarseness and a severe sore throat. Rigid telescopy in the ENT clinic found marked swelling of the arytenoids and false vocal cords. Corticosteroids were increased with resolution of his symptoms. Still later, iritis of the left eye occurred. The patient's eye symptoms responded promptly to an increase in corticosteroid therapy. Interestingly, after six weeks of prednisone 30 mg per day, the patient's beard regrew and he shaved for the first time in 28 years!  There was no regrowth of hair on other parts of his body, including the scalp, axillae, eyelashes, or perineal area. Eleven months into the patient's illness, he developed profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. An autoimmune basis for his complaints was suspected. There was no history of fever, weight loss, prior similar symptoms, wheezing, or shortness of breath. The physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Ear inflammation with sparing of ear lobe. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Chin whiskers after prednisone therapy. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】Routine laboratory studies that were normal or within the expected range included complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, urinalysis, prostate-specific antigen, thyroid stimulating hormone, c and p antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, and protein-electrophoresis with immunoglobulins. Sedimentation rate was 43 mm/hr and the antimicrosomal antibody test was positive at 1  :  400 dilution. Pulmonary function tests showed a forced expiratory volume of 78% of predicted and the vital capacity was 71% of predicted, and the carbon monoxide diffusion test was normal. An antibody type II collagen was strongly positive at 65 eu/mL (positive greater than 25 eu/mL). These findings were felt consistent with relapsing polychondritis. A chest roentgenogram was normal.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Alopecia areata is considered a systemic disease, as tissues other than hair follicles are involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Nail changes include pits, ridges, and reddening of the lunulae. Eye changes have included defects in the retinal pigmentary epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient and the two previously cited cases might suggest that relapsing polychondritis could be yet another systemic manifestation of alopecia areata. In each case, long-term alopecia areata preceded the onset of relapsing polychondritis. Two of the three patients had a particularly severe form of alopecia areata, that is, alopecia universalis. The third patient had recalcitrant alopecia areata .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Summary of cases.</u>\n\n【12】In alopecia areata, the immune response is directed at the hair follicles and helper lymphocytes are thought to play an important role in pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Malgouries et al. have surmised that the helper t-cell infiltration of the hair bulb correlates with loss of chondroitin sulfate, an important proteoglycan in both hair follicles and cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In point of fact, an important early finding in relapsing polychondritis is loss of proteoglycans in cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Additionally, a cell-mediated immune response to proteoglycans has been reported in relapsing polychondritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. One could envision a scenario in which lymphocytes, initially active against chondroitin sulfate in the hair follicle, later attack chondroitin sulfate in ear cartilage and perhaps other tissues. It should be noted that chondroitin sulfate helps maintain immune privilege in the hair follicle.\n\n【13】Two weeks prior to the onset of relapsing polychondritis our patient developed poison ivy on his right forearm. The area improved with conservative therapy. As in relapsing polychondritis, both helper and suppressor t-cells are important in the pathogenesis of allergic contact dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. We could not, however, identify literature support for hapten formation between urushiol and proteoglycans. Thus, the relationship between the illness we describe and allergic contact dermatitis remains unknown.\n\n【14】Our patient had a regrowth of beard hair following corticosteroid therapy. The first patient reported with relapsing polychondritis following alopecia areata, a 57-year-old woman, had no regrowth of scalp or body hair following prednisolone therapy. The second previously reported patient (a 13-year-old girl) had conventional alopecia areata, followed by relapsing polychondritis. She had a variable response to prednisone therapy but a more lasting response to a combination of cotrimoxazole treatment and prednisone. Her alopecia areata disappeared with this therapy. Interestingly, in a mouse model, androgens offer resistance to alopecia areata and estrogens promote susceptibility to alopecia areata 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Conceivably, our patient's beard regrowth may have been influenced by an androgen milieu in the beard area.\n\n【15】In summary, we present a third case of relapsing polychondritis following long standing alopecia areata. This rare association seems immunologically plausible. As noted by Tobin, both cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity are likely important in alopecia areata 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Likewise, it is possible that there are multiple “targets” of any immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. As suggested by Tosti et al. damage to retinal pigmentary epithelium might follow an immune attack on hair follicle melanocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In a similar vein, relapsing polychondritis could follow a long-term immune assault on a hair follicle proteoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, which is also abundant in ear cartilage and other cartilage-bearing tissues.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:46:34", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:00", "cost": 26.033}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:46:34"}

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare primary neuroendocrine cutaneous tumor, rarely metastasizing to the brain. Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) is a disease predisposing to MCC. According to previous reports, headache and focal neurological deficits suggest disease progression to the brain. We present a patient with MCC whose seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain. Case Presentation. A 62-year-old female patient had a history of CLL. A lesion with the appearance of an atheroma was removed from the right upper arm. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of MCC. She was admitted to the neurology department with her first GM seizure. The cranial MRI/MRA showed bone metastases in the right parietal and both frontal areas, compressing the brain. Flow cytometry of CSF did not reveal metastasis of MCC. Conclusions. The case history of the patient was unique even among the rare cases of MCC with neurological involvement. The seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain. In addition to patient history, clinical presentation and radiological findings enabled a suspected diagnosis of skull metastasis of MCC compressing the brain, causing symptomatic epileptic seizures.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and extremely aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy. Both clinically and histologically, it is difficult to differentiate it from neuroendocrine carcinomas, skin metastasis of small cell lung cancer, small cell malignant melanoma, malignant lymphoma, atypical keratoacanthoma, and leiomyosarcoma. In addition to patient history, clinical and radiological findings as well as immunohistochemistry contribute to a definitive diagnosis. Due to the above reasons, it is a significant challenge for the neurologist to diagnose this very rare and malignant disease in a timely manner which needs rapid treatment to provide a chance of recovery.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】The 62-year-old female patient’s chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) was diagnosed 10 years ago and was nonprogressive following chemotherapy. The only other past medical history of note was laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2006.\n\n【6】A lesion with the appearance of an atheroma was removed from the right upper arm 2 years ago. Histology with immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of MCC, and the patient received combined chemotherapy based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. This was discontinued due to bone marrow depression. The lesion recurred 7 months later and was reoperated. At this time, the patient also had right axillary block dissection due to the local recurrence of MCC and its metastasis to the axillary lymph nodes, confirmed by aspiration cytology, showing metastases from both CLL and MCC in the lymph nodes. Postoperative radiotherapy was performed, but the patient’s condition deteriorated. Progressively, a right axillary soft tissue conglomerate mass infiltrated the right lateral thoracic wall, and pathologic upper mediastinal and parasternal lymph nodes appeared. These all showed metastases from MCC. Chemotherapy following the ECO regimen (epirubicin (E) given weekly in combination with cyclophosphamide (C) and vincristin (O) applied during a 3-week interval) was reinitiated due to clinical progression, and the last chemotherapy session (vincristin) was administered 3 days before the patient was admitted to our Department of Neurology due to her first epileptic seizure (GM). The patient complained about headache during the week before admission.\n\n【7】##### 2.1. General Medical State\n\n【8】BP: 115/75 mmHg and HR: 75/min; no bruit over carotid or subclavian arteries; an oblique surgical scar with primary healing on the right upper arm; liver edge at the costal margin.

Cranial CT\n\n【17】Cranial CT showed a 37 × 9 mm hypodensity in the right parietal region, at the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, with marked cerebral and cerebellar atrophy .\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Cranial CT showing marked cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.</u>\n\n【19】##### 2.6. Cranial MR\n\n【20】Cranial MR showed a solid epidural of 2 × 2.8 × 5 cm mass, originating from the bone, in the right parietal region, showing homogeneously low signal intensity on T1-weighted images  and homogeneously high signal intensity on T2 and FLAIR images , with an intense contrast enhancement (mainly) in the peripheral zone and smaller necrotic areas in the central zone. Moderate oedema around the mass is present, with higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value on the ADC images. A 6.2 × 3.2 × 1.3 cm mass, infiltrating the bone, with similar structure and contrast enhancement is seen in mainly the left frontal area . The mass shows higher ADC values in diffusion images. Lacunar encephalopathy and cerebral and cerebellar atrophy were also noted.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Cranial MR showing a solid epidural 2 × 2.8 × 5 cm mass, originating from the bone, in the right parietal region with (a) homogeneously low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and (b) homogeneously high signal intensity on T2 and FLAIR images.

Lumbar Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)\n\n【25】Clear and transparent; cell count: 5 WBC/microliter; total protein: 368 mg/L; CSF glucose: 3.8 mmol/L; serum glucose (simultaneous): 7.5 mmol/L.\n\n【26】CSF cytology: few monocytoid cells and leukocytes. No tumor cells are detected in the sample.\n\n【27】CSF immunology: intact blood-liquor barrier. Intrathecal IgG synthesis is not detected, but oligoclonal gammopathy (OGP) is found.\n\n【28】Flow cytometry of CSF did not reveal metastasis of MCC. CLL was only present in peripheral blood, where 50% of the cells showed a corresponding flow cytometry phenotype.\n\n【29】Based on the clinical picture, the patient was started on carbamazepine. She did not have further epileptic seizures and did not develop any neurological deficit. Metastasis of MCC to the skull (bilateral frontal bones and right parietal bone) was diagnosed based on clinical and radiological presentation and patient history. No histology was performed from the skull mass.\n\n【30】The patient died 3 months later. The cause of death was multiple metastases of MCC.\n\n【31】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【32】MCC is a rare and extremely aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy, presenting as a solitary, painless, thick, livid, and erythematous nodule, mostly on skin areas exposed to sunlight. First, it gives metastases to regional lymph nodes and then to distant organs. MCC is often associated with malignant hematologic diseases, such as CLL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Recently, a polyomavirus was identified, likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of MCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Genetic instability and impaired immune defence due to the primary malignancy contribute to the development of other solid tumors, which may explain the coexistence of MCC with CLL. In addition to conventional radiochemotherapy, novel therapeutic options include treatment with somatostatin analogues in neuroendocrine tumors expressing somatostatin receptors, monoclonal antibody therapy in tumors expressing CD56 antigens, and anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy.\n\n【33】The case history of our patient is unique even among rare cases of MCC giving metastases to the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u> due to the following factors:通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>She had a history of proven CLL通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>The seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain\n\n【34】In addition to patient history, clinical presentation and radiological findings enabled the suspected diagnosis of skull metastasis of MCC compressing the brain, causing symptomatic epileptic seizures. Bone metastasis from CLL was unlikely, as solitary bone lesions in the context of CLL are believed to result from either Richter’s transformation or metastasis from another primary malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, in this case, from MCC. Therefore, previous oncological diagnoses and imaging are of key importance in clarifying the origins of solitary bone lesions of the skull.\n\n【35】#### Abbreviations\n\n| ADC: | Apparent diffusion coefficient |\n| --- | --- |\n| CLL: | Chronic lymphoid leukemia |\n| CSF: | Cerebrospinal fluid |\n| MCC: | Merkel cell carcinoma. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:25:22", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:25:49", "cost": 26.937}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:25:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:25:22"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a complication that has been associated with the use of COVID-19 vaccines that make use of an adenovirus vector 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, namely, Vaxzevria from AstraZeneca and Covishield from Janssen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. VITT is characterized by thrombosis that occurs 5 to 30 days after COVID-19 vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The mortality rate due to VITT varies between 30 and 60%. Primarily, the patients’ treatments included nonheparin anticoagulation and intravenous immune globulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. COVID-19 vaccination was associated with thromboembolic events in some patients, and it is also evident that COVID-19 infection itself is commonly associated with thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Being first reported in February 2021, the syndrome is more commonly described in women, especially those younger than the age of 55 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. According to an initial report released in April 2021 by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the incidence of VITT is 1 in 533,333 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The clinical presentation of VITT appears to be very similar to that of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Symptoms of VITT include severe headache, focal neurological deficits, abdominal and extremity pain, vomiting, and in severe cases, mental status changes, coma, and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>. The pathophysiology of HIT, where immunoglobulin G is produced and forms aggregates with the PF4-heparin complex, closely resembles that of VITT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【6】To confirm the diagnosis, thrombocytopenia, evidence of a new thrombotic event and positivity of the ELISA test for PF4 antibodies are necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> based on the Brighton Collaboration, but this may miss patients who present with either thrombosis with normal platelet count or thrombocytopenia alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.

Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 60-year-old man was in his usual state of health before presenting to the orthopedic clinic at Jordan University Hospital on May 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021, complaining of left hand pain. He did not report any history of trauma. There was no weakness or paresthesia of the left upper limb, nor shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient had no personal or family history of arrhythmias or thrombotic events. There were no other cardiac, respiratory, neurological, musculoskeletal, or other symptoms. He is a nonsmoker, and he does not use any regular medications. His complaint started two weeks after receiving the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\n【10】Two days later, he presented to the emergency department complaining of increasing left hand pain and paresthesia. His left index initially was pale and then became cyanotic. He only felt tired when lifting heavy objects. There were no neurological defects or other associated symptoms.\n\n【11】On presentation, he was alert and oriented with stable vital signs. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological examinations were normal. Upper limb pulses were not palpable on his left hand. His initial INR was 1.32, and his PT and PTT levels were elevated. Other laboratory investigations are presented in Table 1. A Doppler ultrasound of his left upper limb showed a monophasic radial pulse and a triphasic ulnar pulse.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Laboratory results on admission.</u>\n\n【13】The CT scans provided showed an irregular filling defect at the junction between the aortic arch and the descending aorta, in addition to an irregular mural thrombus with calcification involving the aortic arch . There was also occlusion of the left radial artery at the level of the midforearm with retrograde filling at the level of the left rest. The left subclavian, axillary, brachial, and ulnar arteries were patent .\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 IV contrasted CT scan showing filling defect at the junction between the aortic arch and the descending aorta and an irregular mural thrombus with calcification in the aortic arch.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 IV contrasted CT scan showing occlusion of the left radial artery at the level of the midforearm with retrograde filling at the level of the left rest.</u>\n\n【16】The patient was admitted under the care of the cardiovascular team as a case of upper limb ischemia for observation and therapeutic anticoagulation. Four weeks later, our patient presented to the clinic with improvement of his symptoms and reversal of tissue ischemia except for dry gangrene in his distal phalanx of the left index, which was left for autoamputation .\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Photo of the patient’s left hand showing the gangrenous distal phalanx of his left index finger.</u>\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Thrombotic events post-COVID-19 vaccination, a type of VITT, are an evolving issue that depends on different factors such as age, gender, and geographical area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by a triad of benign skin tumors (fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, acrochordons) together with an increased risk of developing malignant renal tumors and pulmonary disease such as pneumothoraces and multiple lung cysts. The morbidity and mortality of the affected patients is determined by the presence of the kidney tumors, which tend to be multifocal and bilateral, as observed in other hereditary kidney cancer syndromes like von Hippel-Lindau disease, familial leiomyomatosis, and hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma. Herein, a patient with BHDS, presenting with synchronous bilateral multiple kidney tumors, is reported. The report describes the management of kidney tumors with two-stage open nephron-sparing surgery in which the nonvascular clamping technique was utilized.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited genodermatosis caused as a result of the mutations in the FLCN gene encoding the protein “folliculin,” a new protein which hypothetically functions as a tumor suppressor gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. The affected patients develop cutaneous follicular tumors (multiple fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons) over the face, neck, and upper trunk and are susceptible to develop renal neoplasms and pulmonary disease (spontaneous pneumothoraces, multiple lung cysts).\n\n【4】Kidney tumors in these patients tend to be multifocal and bilateral, as observed in other hereditary cancer syndromes such as von Hippel-Lindau disease, familial leiomyomatosis, and hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Kidney tumors in BHDS are commonly and characteristically reported as “hybrid oncocytic renal cell carcinoma,” which contain areas of oncocytomas as well as areas of renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe, or others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7\\]</u>. Kidney tumors are the major determinants of morbidity and mortality in patients with BHDS; hence the overall renal functions have to be preserved as much as possible while completely removing the tumors within oncological principles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

Case Report\n\n【15】A 56-year-old woman presented with bilateral multiple kidney tumors, diagnosed radiologically during her evaluation for hematuria.\n\n【16】Computed tomography revealed 4 tumors, diameters ranging between 1 and 3 cm in the left kidney, and 4 tumors, diameters ranging between 1 and 5 cm in the right kidney . Radiologically, most of the tumors had malignant characteristics due to their hypervascularity and radiopaque enhancement.\n\n【17】Her chest X-Ray and CT scan of thorax revealed multiple, randomly distributed air-filled small cysts . Intervening lung parenchyma appeared normal. Coronal images, reconstructed with “minimum intensity projection” technique, showed small cysts; most of them clustered in the right upper lobe. No pneumothorax was identified.\n\n【18】On dermatological examination, she had multiple, asymptomatic, white, 1–3 mm sized, dome-shaped, firm papules over the face, neck, scalp, upper trunk, and back, and multiple skin colored, soft, pedunculated papules on the axillae that were clinically consistent with BHDS . Her dermatological history revealed that her facial papules were present since her early twenties and continued to increase in number.\n\n【19】The clinical diagnosis of the patient was consistent with BHDS.\n\n【20】The patient was scheduled first for a staged approach starting from the right side. Preoperative serum analyses were within normal ranges (serum creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL, BUN: 13 mg/dL, Hb: 13.3 gr/dL), and the patient was healthy otherwise.\n\n【21】Nephron-sparing surgeries were performed using standard intercostals (between 11th-12th ribs) flank incision on each side. The technique consisted of adequate exposure of the kidney. Gerota’s fascia was opened; perinephric fatty tissue was dissected off. Ureter and the vascular pedicle were exposed and marked with vessel loops. After documenting all tumors on the kidney, tumors were “enucleoresected” with the kidney under perfusion, first cauterizing the capsule surrounding the tumor and then by removing the tumor with the help of scissors and brain dissector. First the smaller tumors were enucleated, in order to diminish the risk of bleeding. Frozen sections from tumor beds were done for all tumors. Bleeding from the tumor bed was controlled with 3/0 polyglactin (Vicryl) interrupted sutures and parenchyma was adapted with 2/0 polyglactin (Vicryl) sutures over a surgical bolster. Renal vessels were neither clamped nor compressed during these manipulations.\n\n【22】A total of 4 tumors were enucleated from the right kidney. Operation time was 105 minutes. Time spent during tumor enucleations and renographies was 45 minutes. Estimated blood loss was 100 mL. Postoperative course was uneventful, with a postoperative serum creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL and serum Hb of 11.9 gr/dL. The patient was discharged 4 days after left NSS.\n\n【23】The left kidney was treated 6 weeks after the first stage. Using the same, open, no-ischemia NSS technique, a total of 4 tumors were enucleated from the left kidney. Operation time of the left side was 120 minutes. Time spent during tumor enucleations and renographies was 55 minutes. Estimated blood loss was 150 mL. Postoperative course was also uneventful on the right side and the patient was discharged 4 days after surgery.\n\n【24】On macroscopic examination , the excised tumors of the right kidney measured 3.7 cm, 1.8 cm, 1.7 cm, and 1.2 cm in maximal diameter, respectively. The cut sections of each tumor appeared light brown and glistening. No necrosis or hemorrhage was noted. Excised tumors of the left kidney measured 2.7 cm, 2.1 cm, 1.8 cm, and 0.5 cm in maximal diameter, respectively. Cut sections of each tumor were the same with those of right kidney. All of the tumors appeared sharply circumscribed.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Macroscopic view of one of the tumors removed. The cut section appears light brown and glistering. No necrosis or hemorrhage is noted. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【26】Histomorphologically, each tumor revealed similar features . The H&E sections demonstrated histological features of both oncocytoma and conventional variant of renal cell carcinoma (clear cell RCC). Within these hybrid oncocytic tumors were areas classic for oncocytoma (large cells, ill-defined cell borders, finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm throughout, and large nuclei with homogeneous basophilic chromatin) and other areas consistent with clear cell RCC (well-defined cell borders, clear cytoplasm, round nuclei with centrally located inconspicuous nucleoli). Fuhrman nuclear grade was II in clear cell RCC component. Mitotic features were sparse; no atypical forms were identified. Surgical margins were all negative.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | Microscopic views of H&E sections, demonstrating histological features of both oncocytoma and conventional variant of renal cell carcinoma. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【28】The final serum creatinin level, seen 2 years after the last operation, was 0.9 mg/dL, and her abdominal MR scans  did not show any recurrences or new tumor formation.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 | MRI scans performed 2 years after surgery, documenting no tumoral lesion. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【30】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【31】Partial nephrectomy, or “NSS,” has become the standard procedure for management of small renal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. However, there is a debate going on regarding the technique of applying renal ischemia during NSS to avoid renal damage in the treated kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Current literature supports safe ischemia times, within 20 minutes of warm ischemia and up to 2 hours of cold ischemia, to minimize renal ischemic damage. Thus, if ischemia is required, the tumor should be removed within 20 minutes of warm ischemia, regardless of surgical approach, either open or laparoscopic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【32】However, most of the data regarding our current knowledge on this subject is based on large case series, which are composed of “single” small renal masses, and patients with hereditary kidney cancer, such as von Hippel-Lindau disease, familial leiomyomatosis, and hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma usually presenting with bilateral multiple tumors, constitute challenges 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11\\]</u>. Taking into consideration that these patients develop renal tumors at younger ages and that their kidney pathologies are the major determinants of their prognosis, a great care has to be given in their management.\n\n【33】The incidence of multifocality of RCC ranges between 6 and 25% in published series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u> The dilemma of the management of ipsilateral multiple tumors has recently been investigated by Lin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. They compared the operative findings, renal functional outcomes, and intermediate-term cancer-specific survival of patients undergoing either laparoscopic partial nephrectomy or laparoscopic cryoablation and report similar results. However, the number of tumors they treated ranged between 2 and 3 per kidney, and the majority of tumors were <4 cm in size. Furthermore they report a median warm ischemia time of 36 minutes (range: 12–48), although they underline that the postoperative renal function was preserved in all patients in the intermediate term. Interestingly, they managed 2 patients in their series under cold ischemia only without vascular clamping but had to clamp the hilum because of a bleeding during tumor removal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【34】In the present patient, a total of 8 kidney tumors were removed with open NSS from two kidneys and the total surgical manipulation time just for tumor removals and renographies was 45 minutes per kidney, without vascular clamping. This time period is clearly higher than the universally accepted limits under warm ischemia. So even in highly experienced hands, using either open or robot assisted/laparoscopic approach, vascular clamping would increase the risk of renal function loss.\n\n【35】Recently, increasing number of papers are getting published regarding the safety of partial nephrectomy without renal hilar occlusion in selected cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Robot-assisted surgical techniques did clearly supply manipulative advantages, especially during reconstruction, when compared to pure laparoscopic techniques. However, multiple renal tumor removal for multifocal renal cancer, without renal hilar clamping, has not been reported with robot-assisted surgery yet.\n\n【36】In conclusion, we present the case that the nonvascular clamping open NSS, when used in patients with hereditary kidney cancer syndromes such as BHDS, minimizes the risk of renal function loss.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【7】(a) Axial CT images show small cysts randomly distributed\n\n【8】(b) Intervening lung parenchyma appears normal\n\n【9】© Coronal image reconstructed with “minimum intensity projection” technique shows small cysts; some are clustered in the right upper lobe.

They belong to the lactic acid bacteria group and are also known as a usual part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract as well as of the urinary and genital tracts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The occurrence of those bacteria in miscellaneous mucosa is normally associated with stimulation of the immune system and protection against pathogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. They are an infrequent human pathogen but can induce several infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> such as bacteremia, infectious endocarditis, dental caries, and intra-abdominal infections with liver or splenic abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Endocarditis due to Lactobacillus is associated with structural heart disease, recent surgery, extended antibiotic and probiotic use, reduced immunity, and other relevant comorbid factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. We report a case of Lactobacillus bacteremia with mitral valve endocarditis and splenic abscesses.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 81-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our department for several weeks of symptoms such as chills, fever, malaise, fatigue, and recurrent tumble despite antibiotic therapy. She was treated prior to admission for approximately two weeks with antibiotics in another hospital. The patient had an important abdominal surgery due to gastric carcinoma three months prior to admission. Gastrectomy, lymphadenectomy, and esophageal stent because of esophageal anastomosis insufficiency were performed during this surgery. The patient had initially presented with chills and recurrent tumble at the family doctor and was at this time admitted in another hospital. With increasing inflammation parameters despite antibiotic therapy and recurrent fever, the medication was changed from amoxicillin to piperacillin/tazobactam on admission. Three independent sets of peripheral blood cultures were obtained before the start of changed antibiotic. All three sets depicted Lactobacillus species. The patient denied ingesting any probiotics. We suspected endocarditis because of bacteremia with Lactobacillus, recurrent symptoms with worsening of condition, and persistent infection despite antibiotic. On admission, she was febrile to 38.3°C, somnolent, complaining of generalized fatigue and malaise. Her heart rate was 85 bpm, and her blood pressure was 110/75 mmHg. Clinical examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur loudest at the apex such as no painful haemorrhagic spots (Janeway lesion) on all fingertips of the left hand. Lung auscultation and chest X-ray showed no anomaly. Laboratory studies showed a normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin: 9.0 g/dl; MCV: 85.0 fl), a regular white blood cell count (8.960/µl), reduced platelet count (123.000/µl), elevated C-reactive protein (12.6 mg/dl), and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (310 U/l). We performed a transesophageal echocardiogram for further diagnosis. It showed degenerative changes of the mitral valve with moderate regurgitation as well as small endocarditis vegetation (Figures 1(a) and 1(b) Pronounced vegetation of the mitral valve could not be seen. The susceptibility testing showed that the isolate was resistant to vancomycin. After application of the Duke criteria (one major criterion and three minor criteria were found) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> in combination with the clinical condition, the diagnosis of endocarditis was more likely. The major criterion was the vegetation and degenerative changes of the mitral valve, and the minor criteria were the three positive blood cultures with Lactobacillus species, fever over 38.0°C, and the Janeway lesion found on the left hand. We started an intravenous antibiotic therapy with ampicillin (2 g with six administrations per day) combined with gentamicin (with maximum 80 mg per day) for six weeks. The CT scan on admission revealed subcapsular fluid formation of the spleen . During antibiotic therapy, we performed a PET/CT scan to localize potential inflammatory foci due to embolic complication. Florid inflammatory processes were found in several locations within the spleen . This result was interpreted as peripheral embolization due to endocarditis. We discussed the result of the PET/CT scan with our abdominal/visceral surgeons. They decided upon an operational treatment of the splenic abscesses. The patient underwent an abdominal surgery with splenectomy. Other blood cultures were drawn under the antibiotic therapy. They were all negative without exception. The patient required no mitral valve replacement for cure.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Transesophageal echocardiography with a corner of 0°.

This combination has been established in the past. The endocarditis itself could not be seen in PET/CT.

It classically presents as a painful orthostatic headache that is exacerbated when a patient is upright. For treatment, patients are often started on conservative options such as hydration, caffeine, bedrest, and NSAID analgesics; however, certain patients who fail these therapies may require intervention with an epidural blood patch. The epidural blood patch remains the gold standard for treating refractory postdural puncture headache. Contraindications to epidural blood patch include severe coagulopathy, patient refusal, or infection at the intended site of entry. There are no clear consensus recommendations regarding patients with a hematological malignancy and potential risk that autologous blood may seed malignant cells into the neuraxis. In this case report, we present a patient with acute myeloid leukemia who developed a postdural puncture headache after receiving subarachnoid administration of antineoplastics. The patient was refractory to conservative therapy, prompting multidisciplinary consultation and discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of proceeding with an epidural blood patch. Ultimately, the patient elected to proceed with the offered epidural blood patch which led to complete resolution of his painful headaches and did not cause any spread of malignant cells into his neuraxis or cerebral spinal fluid.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is a frequently encountered complication following any neuraxial procedure which either purposefully or inadvertently punctures the dura. Risk factors for PDPH include age less than 60, female gender, pregnancy, and the use of larger gauge or cutting needles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A dural puncture headache presents as a severe fronto-occipital headache which is orthostatic in nature, namely, symptoms are exacerbated when the patient is upright and improved when laying supine. The pathophysiology is debated; one proposal posits that upright positioning causes increased loss of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and intracranial sagging which elicits painful traction on the meninges, while an alternative mechanism suggests pain is elicited from meningeal vasodilation which is a compensatory mechanism for intracranial hypotension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Conservative treatment includes hydration, caffeine, bedrest, and abdominal binder application, along with medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen. For patients refractory to conservative treatments, an epidural blood patch (EBP) remains the most effective therapy with greater than 75% of patients reporting complete symptom resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. EBP contraindications include coagulopathy, elevated intracranial pressure, patient refusal, bacteremia, or local infection at the puncture site. In patients who are unable to receive an EBP, a sphenopalatine ganglion block via topical anesthetic may also provide relief.\n\n【4】An EBP is usually considered a low-risk procedure when autologous blood from a healthy patient is used; however, further consideration is warranted in a patient with a hematological malignancy or with immunocompromised status. The literature on this subject is sparse, and no consensus or expert recommendations exist to guide clinicians. While alternatives to autologous blood, such as donated allogenic blood, fibrin glue, or saline have been postulated, there is a paucity of data on their efficacy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A previously healthy 31-year-old male with a medical history only significant for previous polysubstance abuse presented to his local emergency department with a one-month history of night sweats, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion. Emergency department workup revealed a critical leukocytosis of 466 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (normal range = 4.5–11 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), normocytic anemia with hemoglobin of 4.1 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 18 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (normal range = 150–400 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Given concern for acute leukemia with impending blast crisis, the patient was emergently transferred to a tertiary medical center for treatment escalation. Cytoreductive therapy was initiated, and subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Induction chemotherapy was initiated, and on hospital day 28, a diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) was performed to examine for central nervous system disease. A 20-gauge cutting spinal needle was inserted at the L3-L4 level to obtain a CSF sample, and no immediate postoperative complications were noted. Wright-Giemsa staining of CSF showed blast cell formation, and intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy was initiated on day 31, and the intrathecal space was again accessed via a 20-gauge cutting spinal needle. Less than 24 hours after this procedure, our patient reported a debilitating positional headache that was brought on after sitting upright or standing for 30 minutes. He rated the pain intensity as a 9 out of 10 when upright, with complete resolution when recumbent. He endorsed that the headaches were accompanied by mild nausea but denied vision changes, photophobia, fever, and neck stiffness, and he had no focal neurologic deficits on exam. He was initiated on conservative therapy with both oral and parenteral caffeine, intravenous fluids, and acetaminophen. After 11 days of intractable postural headache pain, the Interventional Pain Service was consulted for consideration of an EBP.\n\n【7】Prior to consenting the patient for EBP, the team considered the possibility of meningitis, in addition to the risk of seeding malignant cells into the CSF. Given the presence of the characteristic postural headache and the absence of fever over the previous 11 days, the probability of meningitis was deemed to be very low. With respect to the consideration of the risk of seeding the CSF, it was noted that in contrast to the most recent CSF analysis, repeat bone marrow biopsy one day prior did not identify blast cells. After a thorough, multidisciplinary discussion ensuring his understanding of the risks, the patient decided to pursue EBP. Under fluoroscopic guidance, an 18G Tuohy needle was used to access the L3-4 epidural space via loss-of-resistance technique. Fluoroscopic contrast injection confirmed epidural placement, and the patient received a slow injection of 20 mL autologous blood . The procedure was uncomplicated, and within an hour the patient had complete resolution of symptoms. Following the successful EBP, he had three additional, uncomplicated lumbar punctures for both CSF blast cell analysis and ongoing IT chemotherapy. The subsequent CSF findings were negative for blast cells, and he did not have any further postural headaches. At time of follow-up one year later, the patient had achieved remission, remained free from substance use, and had no recurrence of postural headaches.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The L3-L4 epidural space was accessed under fluoroscopy, and correct placement was confirmed with injection of contrast.</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】The International Classification of Headache Disorders’ criterion for a PDPH diagnosis is the development of a headache within 5 days of dural puncture that either spontaneously resolves within 1 week or within 48 hours after EBP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A postural headache which worsens when upright is pathognomonic for PDPH, and the most common associated symptoms include nausea, neck stiffness, and rarely photophobia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. When evaluating a patient with a postural headache after a dural puncture, a thorough history and physical exam should be performed to rule out more insidious etiologies masquerading as PDPH, such as posterior reversible encephalopathy, subdural hematoma, cerebral venous thrombosis, or arachnoiditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Conservative management should be considered and discussed with the patient, as approximately 50% of dural puncture headaches will resolve within 4 days of dural puncture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. EBP remains the gold standard of treatment for PDPH, with resolution rates >75% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. There are limited data on the risk of seeding malignant cells into the neuraxis with autologous blood from a patient with an active hematological malignancy; thus, the decision to perform an EBP in these patients remains challenging.\n\n【12】Albeit sparse, there is literature addressing whether a patient with an active hematological malignancy is a candidate for EBP given the potential risk to seed the neuraxis with autologous blood containing malignant cells. Strand et al. retrospectively reported outcomes of 19 hematologic malignancy patients who underwent EBP and found that one patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subsequently developed a biopsy-confirmed DLBCL brain lesion following EBP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, the authors suggest that its location on the corpus callosum make the epidural or intrathecal spaces an unlikely anatomical point of origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Demaree et al. conducted a retrospective review of 18 leukemia and 62 lymphoma patients who underwent EBP for PDPH, and after a median follow-up period of over 3 years, they reported that no patients developed CNS involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Providers should be cognizant of the infection risk associated with EBP administration, particularly in the immunocompromised host. Seeding of normal skin flora into the CSF or epidural space during catheter insertion may lead to meningitis or epidural abscess formation, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Contamination of the injection site by the normal upper airway flora of the proceduralist has also been implicated in infection following neuraxial interventions. Each of these modes of transmission can be minimized by meticulous attention to aseptic technique. Hand hygiene, use of sterile gloves and a facemask, and decontamination of the injection site with an alcohol-based antiseptic should be routine aspects of aseptic technique in neuraxial anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A further mode of transmission that deserves special consideration in this case is the direct inoculation of microorganisms contained in the blood patch where the patient has an underlying blood stream infection (BSI). On the basis of expert consensus, BSI is a relative contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A neutropenic host may not manifest with the usual signs of BSI, and in cases where a patient is febrile and has an absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/μL, the procedure should be postponed.\n\n【14】In this case report, we described a patient with a PDPH who was hospitalized for a recently discovered hematological malignancy. The patient continued to have debilitating postural headache pain eleven days after his most recent lumbar puncture, and he had failed conservative treatments. In our case, the decision to proceed with an EBP was influenced by a serendipitous finding that on the day prior, his bone marrow biopsy was bereft of blast cells while they were still detected in his CSF analysis. While these findings do not eliminate the risk of CNS seeding, they helped tilt the risk-benefit analysis in favor of proceeding with an EBP.\n\n【15】Although definitive solutions are not always present in such challenging medical situations, it is imperative for the clinician to have an open discussion with the patient on risks and benefits of EBP and to assess the degree of discomfort and burden from the PDPH. Given the lack of safety data and the considerable variability in the goals each patient may have, we advocate for a multidisciplinary discussion individually tailored to the needs of the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:41:31", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:41:35", "cost": 4.092}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:41:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:41:29"}

Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 32-year-old woman was transferred to our hospital for the management of severe acute thrombotic microangiopathy resulting in multiorgan failure.\n\n【7】The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced heavy menstrual bleeding. Two days later, she developed fatigue and dyspnea on exertion while at work. She returned home and went to bed early to rest. Overnight, she developed cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was transported to a local hospital for evaluation. Her past medical history was notable for several spontaneous miscarriages and recent hair loss. She was a native of Haiti and worked in a local restaurant in Miami. She denied use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. On physical examination, the patient was a well-developed young woman in respiratory distress. The temperature was 37.0°C, the blood pressure 121/66 mm Hg, the pulse 106 beats/minute, the respiratory rate 42 breaths/minute, and the oxygen saturation 79% while breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs demonstrated diffuse crackles. Chest radiograph revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Supplemental oxygen was administered. However, the patient developed hemoptysis and was immediately intubated.\n\n【8】Laboratory data are summarized under “Day 1” in Table 1. There were severe hemolytic anemia, profound thrombocytopenia, and severe renal disease leading to azotemia, hyperkalemia, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, proteinuria, and hematuria. Blood films revealed numerous schistocytes. In addition, there were leukocytosis, neutrophilia, monocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia. Coagulation studies demonstrated markedly elevated D-Dimer. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated. Serologic tests disclosed antibodies against nuclear antigens including double-stranded DNA, chromatin, Smith antigen, ribonucleoproteins, SSA/Ro, and SSB/La. Complement C3 level was reduced and C4 was low-normal. Antibodies against glomerular basement membrane were not detected. Indirect immunofluorescence staining for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies demonstrated a weak cytoplasmic pattern (c-ANCA). Plasma ADAMTS-13 activity (a disintegrin and metalloprotease, with thrombospondin-1—like domains) was normal. Serologic tests for hepatitis B and C and HIV were negative.

Bloody secretions were noted in the endotracheal tube. There were alopecia and hyperpigmented areas on the scalp. There were punctuate subconjunctival hemorrhage bilaterally and scattered petechiae on the lower extremities. Pitting edema was present over shins. Chest radiography revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Renal ultrasonography revealed enlarged kidneys (13.2 cm in length) with increased echogenicity. There was no hydronephrosis, masses, or stones. Laboratory data are summarized under “Day 17” in Table 1. There were neutrophilia, lymphopenia, hemolytic anemia, profound thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and renal insufficiency. Blood films revealed numerous schistocytes. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria and hematuria. Urinary protein excretion was estimated at 14.6 g/day based on a random urine protein to creatinine ratio. Urine sediment revealed numerous white blood cells and dysmorphic red blood cells. Several red blood cell casts and muddy brown casts were also observed. Serologic tests confirmed antinuclear antibodies of the same specificities previously reported. Complement C3 level remained low and C4 was normal. C-reactive protein was elevated. Plasma activity of ADAMTS-13 was normal. Antibodies against platelet factor-4, myeloperoxidase, proteinase-3, and glomerular basement membrane were not detected. Coagulation studies demonstrated markedly elevated D-Dimer. Elevated dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVT) ratio and positive hexagonal phospholipid (Staclot LA) test indicated the presence of lupus anticoagulant.\n\n【13】The patient was diagnosed with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome with concurrent hemorrhagic manifestations in the setting of new-onset SLE. Plasma exchange therapy was continued with one plasma volume exchanged with fresh frozen plasma every day for three consecutive days. Intermittent hemodialysis was continued. Medications included prednisone 60 mg/day and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day. Platelets were infused as needed. On the 5th hospital day, the patient was extubated. In the meantime, urine output increased. On the 6th hospital day, the last hemodialysis treatment was given. On the 8th hospital day, intravenous rituximab 1 g was administered for persistent thrombocytopenia. A 24 hour urine collection demonstrated protein excretion of 12.7 g/day. On the 15th hospital day, the patient was ambulating requiring no supplemental oxygen. Laboratory tests revealed serum creatinine concentration of 0.8 mg/dL, hemoglobin concentration of 8.5 g/dL (no blood transfusion for 16 days), and platelet count 33,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (no platelet transfusion for 7 days). She was discharged home on prednisone 60 mg/day and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, dapsone for PCP prophylaxis, esomeprazole, and calcium/vitamin D supplements. She missed her follow-up appointments after discharge.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】We presented a young woman with a history of several spontaneous miscarriages who developed acute thrombotic microangiopathy associated with DAH, menorrhagia, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease. Laboratory tests revealed antinuclear antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. She was diagnosed with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome in the setting of new-onset SLE.\n\n【16】The catastrophic APS (CAPS) is a rare life-threatening form of APS in which disseminated vascular thrombosis results in multiorgan failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The diagnosis of CAPS requires fulfillment of the following four criteria: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> involvement of three or more organs/tissues; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> development of manifestations in one week; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> histological evidence of vascular thrombosis; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> presence of antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions at least twelve weeks apart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Our patient developed a catastrophic disease involving the lungs, kidneys, and heart in less than a week. Although we could not establish a histological diagnosis of vascular thrombosis due to severe thrombocytopenia, the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and markedly elevated fibrin degradation products including D-Dimer indicated vascular thrombosis.\n\n【17】In approximately one half of cases, CAPS is superimposed on APS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Although our patient had not been diagnosed with APS prior to her current presentation, a history of several spontaneous miscarriages could have been due to preceding APS. A concurrent autoimmune disorder is present in approximately one half of patients with CAPS. These include SLE (40%), lupus-like syndromes (5%), and other types of autoimmune diseases (9%). Although our patient did not have a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease, serologic studies at the time of current presentation revealed antibodies directed against several nuclear antigens. Antibodies against double-stranded DNA and Smith antigen are considered to be specific for SLE. CAPS affects predominantly women of childbearing age. A precipitating factor can be identified in the majority of patients. These include infection (22%), surgery (10%), discontinuation of anticoagulation (8%), medication (7%), obstetric complication (7%), and a neoplastic process (5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We were unable to identify a precipitating factor in our patient.\n\n【18】The kidneys, lungs, central nervous system, heart, skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract are most commonly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Pulmonary disease occurs in 24% of patients upon presentation and in 64% of patients during the course of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary embolism are the most common pulmonary manifestations. Thrombosis of pulmonary arteries and arterioles sometimes occurs. DAH occurs in 6% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 7\\]</u>. The pathogenesis of DAH in CAPS is poorly understood. The histological examination of the lung in APS patients with DAH revealed microvascular thrombosis and, in some patients, capillaritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In our patient, hemoptysis and a characteristic chest radiograph suggested a diagnosis of hemorrhagic alveolitis in the context of CAPS. However, it is conceivable that severe thrombocytopenia accounted for or contributed to DAH. The absence of antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies at the time of presentation excluded Goodpasture’s syndrome. Although indirect immunofluorescence staining for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies demonstrated a weak cytoplasmic pattern, ELISA for antimyeloperoxidase and antiproteinase-3 antibodies was negative.\n\n【19】Present in only 18% of patients upon presentation, renal disease ultimately occurs in 71% of patients with CAPS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The most frequent renal manifestations in CAPS are hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, and acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4, 7–9\\]</u>. Proteinuria averaged 2.8 g/day (0.6–6.1 g/day) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Histologically, the most common finding is acute thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by deposition of fibrin thrombi in glomeruli, arterioles, or both. Interstitial inflammation is reported in one third of the patients. On a rare occasion, interstitial hemorrhage accompanies microvascular thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9\\]</u>. Immune-complex deposition is rarely observed. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are indicative of chronic kidney injury. Concentric laminations of fibrotic intima of arteries and arterioles (onion skin pattern) indicate chronic vascular damage. In line with these observations, our patient presented with acute renal failure, nephrotic-range proteinuria, hematuria, and leukocyturia. Because of severe thrombocytopenia, renal biopsy was not performed. Nonetheless, heavy proteinuria in conjunction with dysmorphic red blood cells and red blood cell casts in the urine indicated severe glomerular injury.\n\n【20】Cardiac disease is present in 10% and 51% of CAPS patients upon presentation and during the course of the disease, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias are the most frequent cardiac manifestations and can result in heart failure and cardiac arrest. The following types of valvular heart disease were encountered in one third of the patients: mitral regurgitation (10%), tricuspid regurgitation (8%), Libman-Sacks endocarditis (6%), aortic regurgitation (4%), and combined mitral and aortic regurgitation (4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Upon presentation, our patient was found to have moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as reduced ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities. At the time of discharge, a follow-up echocardiogram revealed improved valvular function with only mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n【21】The clinical manifestations of CAPS are usually a consequence of acute thrombotic microangiopathy resulting in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. In approximately one half of CAPS patients, the platelet count is less than 100,000/mm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Thrombocytopenia in APS is believed to be due to antibodies against \\-glycoprotein-I causing platelet activation and aggregation as well as antibodies against platelet glycoproteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. The etiology of severe thrombocytopenia in our patient was likely multifactorial and included platelet aggregation and consumption due to severe vascular thrombosis and platelet loss due to DAH and vaginal bleeding. Because of the presence of several autoantibodies, it is conceivable that our patient could have had antibodies against platelet glycoproteins as well.\n\n【22】Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thromocytopenia can also be secondary to other types of acute thrombotic microangiopathies such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The differentiation between HUS/TTP and CAPS is sometimes difficult. As a general rule, schistocytosis are marked in HUS/TTP and mild in CAPS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Fever and neurologic manifestations frequently dominate the clinical picture in patients with TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In addition, plasma ADAMTS-13 activity is less than 5% of normal in most patients with TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Our patient developed neither a fever nor neurologic manifestations upon presentation. In addition, her plasma ADAMTS-13 activity was normal. In the majority of patients with HUS, an infection with toxicogenic bacteria precedes the onset of the disease. No bacterial infection could be documented in our patient upon presentation. Furthermore, the presence of lupus anticoagulant and other autoantibodies was in favor of the diagnosis of CAPS in the setting of SLE.\n\n【23】Most CAPS patients are treated with anticoagulation and high-dose glucocorticoids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, additional therapeutic interventions such as plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulins, and antiplatelet agents are often used in various combinations. Early diagnosis and treatment have reduced the mortality rate from 53% to 33% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Considering severe thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic manifestations, anticoagulation was not an option in our patient. However, a combination therapy consisting of high-dose glucocorticoids, plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide and rituximab resulted in hematological, cardiopulmonary, and renal recovery. In conclusion, this exceedingly rare case emphasizes that hemorrhagic manifestations, severe microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia can dominate the clinical picture in CAPS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 17:41:10", "endTime": "2024/09/23 17:41:34", "cost": 24.322}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 01:41:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 01:41:09"}

We describe the 24th case of SCACP, the malignant counterpart of syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SCAP). At the present, we do not know whether SCACP arises from eccrine or apocrine glands because of the contrasting opinions in the literature. Only few histochemical and ultrastructural studies have previously advised that SCACP could arise from pluripotent stem cells. Through our case, we wish to suggest the stem cell-like properties of the syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum. This rare neoplasm shows two different patterns of stem cell marker expression in the glandular and squamous components, respectively. For the double phenotype of SCACP, we propose it like an intriguing model to study histogenesis and stem cell properties for more wide-ranging epithelial tumors.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum (SCACP) is a rare malignant form of syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SCAP), cutaneous adnexal neoplasm defined by Stokes in 1917. Some authors are unsure about the malignant transformation in syringocystadenoma papilliferum but, recently, Hoekzema et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> have presented a well-documented SCACP case arising from preexisting SCAP, which appeared to be an epidermal nevus. SCAP mostly occurs in the head and neck region and is associated with a nevus sebaceous (NS) of Jadassohn in 30–40% of cases, but may also appear de novo (without NS) on other parts of the body.\n\n【4】There is an increasing evidence for an apocrine histogenesis of SCAP and SCACP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> but the possibility of an eccrine origin from sweat glands for a few cases seems likely. Another theory suggests the apoeccrine glands to be the origin of these tumors that could be skin hamartomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. Very few histochemical and ultrastructural studies propose that SCACP arises from pluripotent cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 4\\]</u>. A little map of the different theories is shown in Table 1.\n\n【5】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Histogenetic theories of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.</u>\n\n【6】Histologically, the connection to the skin surface, by typical epidermal transition, the decapitation on the luminal surface of inner layer cells, the tumor connection to folliculosebaceous structures, the layering of apocrine glands in the underlying tissues, and positive reactions to diastase-resistance periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) provide evidence of apocrine differentiation of SCACP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Herein, we report a case of SCACP occurring on the left shoulder of an 88-year-old European male patient.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【9】##### 2.1. Case\n\n【10】An 88-year-old man presented with a single nodule on the left shoulder. He had had multiple lesions for 20 years of bowenoid actinic keratosis on the face, the forehead, and the left ear. In the last 13 years, the patient underwent prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma, score 8 (5+3) according to Gleason and squamous cell carcinoma on the left eyelid surgically treated. The man stated that the lesion began as a bean-sized papule and had increased gradually in size with time. It also became painful. Physical examination revealed a single, 1.5 × 1.5 cm, erythematous, dome-shaped, and firm tumor surrounded by normal skin on the left shoulder. Regional lymph nodes were not palpable, and the physical examination did not reveal any remarkable findings except for the mass. The patient had no clinical or radiographic evidence of a head and neck or lung primary tumors. He died after two years of old age.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Histology\n\n【12】The present skin tumor was clinically analyzed and then resected tumor specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 μm were subjected to conventional microscopic histochemical and immunohistochemical observations.\n\n【13】PAS reaction, with and without diastase digestion, was also carried out.\n\n【14】For the immunostaining, we used an automatic and clinically validated instrument based on Ventana Benchmark Ultra systems from Roche Tissue Diagnostics. Immunohistochemistry was performed by means of a new enhanced sensitivity biotin-free multimer technology system, based on direct linkers between peroxidase and secondary antibodies (ultraView Universal DAB Detection Kit, Ventana Medical System). The following primary antibodies were used prediluted: antipancytokeratin (PCT), anticytokeratin 7 (CK7), anticytokeratin 5/6 (MES), anti-e-cadherin (epithelial) (e-cad), antiepithelial membrane antigen (EMA), anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), anti-p63, anti-S100 by Ventana; anti-CD117 (c-kit) (Cell Marque), and anti-Ki-67 antigen (MIB-1) by DAKO.\n\n【15】For immunofluorescence, sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, as described above, and unmasked using a commercially available kit (Unmasker, Diapath). Slices were incubated with Immunological Sciences primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-CD44 1 : 50, and rabbit polyclonal anti-CD133 4 μL/mL and then incubated with Molecular Probes secondary antibodies, 1 : 100, goat anti-mouse, green fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated and goat anti-rabbit, and red fluorescent Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated and finally counterstained with 0.0001% DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), in accordance with the preview published protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【17】All the immunoprofiling data about the normal skin, the benign lesion, and the carcinomatous component are summarized in Table 2.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 2 Antigen expression of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.</u>\n\n【19】Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histological sections showed squamous cancer cells in the dermis to be gradually deepening. The squamous budding generated internal cavities giving rise to glandular papillary structures. These tumoral squamous-papillary glands were positively stained by anti-PCT antibody in the outer layer of budding; the glandular component was heterogeneously stained with accentuation of the membranes. Anti-CK5/6 strongly stained the transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplasia; the squamous solid component and the glandular structures were moderately stained. The transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplasia was strongly positive for CK7; the glandular budding and the papillary components were intensely stained by CK7 antibody; contemporaneously, the squamous solid neoplasia appeared negative. E-cad staining showed an increase of pericytoplasmic positivity in the transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplasia but completely negative was the infiltrative portion. Neoplastic areas, in contrast with normal epidermis, resulted in totally stained EMA. Syringocystadenocarcinoma was completely negative for CEA and robustly positive with patchy nuclear for p63 staining. By anti-c-kit antibody, we obtained highly positive staining of basal layer of neoplastic budding; the glandular and papillary structures were heterogeneously positive but almost negative and/or speckled positive was the squamous solid component. The evident desmoplastic stromal reaction accompanied the budding and contained numerous plasma cells and lymphocytes. The epithelial transition and the decapitated secretion provided evidence of apocrine differentiation; the cytological atypia gave a precious suggestion of the neoplasm. An invasive squamous component coexisted with glandular elements typical for adenocarcinomas. The dual p63-CK7 immunohistochemical positivity was useful in confirming the diagnosis definitive of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.\n\n【20】Nestin, CD44, and CD133 antigens, markers of stem cell properties, were overexpressed in the neoplasm and could suggest a tumor origin by pluripotent stem cells.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【22】We report a second case of syringocystadenocarcinoma with some unique histologic features; preview described by Leeborg et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> demonstrates the p63 positive-gradual transition area from keratinizing squamous epithelium to neoplasm . Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is a rare neoplasm of doubtful (apocrine versus eccrine) origin and is the malignant counterpart of the more common benign syringocystadenoma papilliferum. Histologically, syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum resembles syringocystadenoma papilliferum and solid areas of tumor may be present, in addition to the glandular, cystic, and papillary areas that deepen like dermal cleft by a squamous transition epithelium . The glandular epithelial cells show malignant cytological features, such as high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios and nuclear irregularity, and, in particular, they are PAS diastase positive, with decapitated cytoplasm, confirming the apocrine origin. Our case is distinctive in several aspects. It is the second report, to our knowledge, to document the presence of a high-grade cell component originally considered to be a high-grade squamous cell carcinoma and then demonstrated adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is the first case to provide immunohistochemical evidence of stem cell features and epithelial-mesenchymal transition- (EMT-) like properties.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Analysis of a skin syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum specimen.

(d) A few positive cells of the squamous neoplasia are stained by Nestin antibody, stemness marker (original magnification ×400). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【25】To analyze the biological and carcinogenetic property of our tumor case, we have used a series of antibodies fit for recognizing epithelial expression, proliferation index, and stem cell properties.\n\n【26】Like Leeborg et al. suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, we have found CK7 and p63 positive-cells in continuous stream from normal epithelium to neoplastic adenocarcinoma clefts, that is, the squamous-glandular transdifferentiation of the tumor . Furthermore p63 positivity supports the primary origin of the squamous and/or cutaneous-adnexal tumor and distinguishes it from metastatic adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Simultaneously, we have demonstrated, for the first time, a possible staminal origin of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum by c-kit, nestin, CD44, and CD133 immunopositivity.\n\n【27】The transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit (CD117) is a 145–165-kD proto-oncogene, related to platelet-derived factor receptor and the colony stimulatory factor receptor. The primary ligand for c-kit is stem cell factor (SCF) or also named mast cell growth factor and steel factor. Evidence supports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> the existence of CD117 as putative marker of mesenchymal stem cells and/or cancer stem cells. Overexpression of c-kit has been demonstrated in several human tumors such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), small-cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, Ewing’s tumor, and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Other c-kit positive-normal cells include epithelial cells in skin adnexa, breast, and subsets of cerebellar neurons.\n\n【28】In our case, we observed c-kit positive-epidermal epithelium basal layer connected with neoplastic budding by c-kit positive-tumor cells that presented the same pattern of positivity for CK7 and p63, too . The positivity for c-kit was robust and more intense in the basal layer of the glandular neoplastic budding, in continuity with the c-kit positive-normal basal layer of epithelium. We observed heterogeneously intense-moderate amount of staining of glandular and papillary structures; almost negative, with limited occurrence and speckled positivity appeared the squamous solid component. Interestingly, we found some positive spindle cells in perineoplastic stroma . Recently, it has been reported that c-kit plays a critical role in the invasion and metastasis of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) and may participate in EMT of salivary ACC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Furthermore e-cad staining was interestingly expressed (data not shown). We found, as recent literature has proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>, a different level of this central component of cell junctions-adhesion molecule: plasmalemmal positivity in the normal tissue and in the transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplastic budding with occasionally negative neoplastic cells; we observed a gradual decreasing of e-cad positivity into neoplasia, with focally negative neoplastic glands. Totally unstained appeared the invasive papillary component. All of these data together either with c-kit pattern or with the spindle cell morphology in the front of infiltration and the surrounding desmoplastic stromal reaction  could be convincing features of EMT-like process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>. The EMT paradigm is a developmental pathway by which epithelial cells are transdifferentiated to mesenchymal cells during embryogenesis, tissue remodelling, and wound healing. Recently, an interesting hypothesis considers EMT as a more general event that has been implicated in all types of carcinoma and provides them with an additional survival advantage. By means of EMT, the epithelial tumor cells would transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, losing their malignant phenotype but producing the desmoplastic stroma which is essential for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. In human cancer, the phenomenon is rarely demonstrated because, after the infiltrative spreading, it is fast reverted by mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) program, in cancerous epithelial phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27–29\\]</u>. It has been observed that, during the EMT process, cancer epithelial cells acquire stem cell-like traits and appear positive for putative cancer stem cell (CSC) markers, resulting in a migratory cell phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30, 31\\]</u>. So EMT-like properties of carcinoma are more persuasive, when they are associated with an increase of putative stemness marker expression. For this reason, we have analyzed nestin, CD44, and CD133 antigens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 24, 32–34\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Nestin, VI intermediate filament protein and marker of precursor cells, is also expressed in the stem cells of the hair follicle and in the endothelial cells; moreover, nestin is expressed in the peritumoral stroma of basal cell carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 33\\]</u>. In our case, we found in bulge squamous area of neoplasia some nests of nestin-positive stroma cells with mesenchymal phenotype  but also convincing clusters of nestin positive-cancer stem cells in the epithelial neoplasia .\n\n【30】The CD44 antigen is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion and migration, for these properties participate in a wide variety of cellular functions including lymphocyte activation, recirculation and homing, hematopoiesis, and tumor metastasis. Recently CD44 has been recognized as a marker of putative cancer stem cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>, in particular of squamous phenotype; CD44 high expression plays a crucial key role in initiation, malignant transformation, and EMT-like program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 32, 36\\]</u>. An interesting aspect of our case consists of evident overexpression of CD44 in squamous component of neoplasia, with spreading positivity in the perineoplastic stroma cells. Almost completely negative for CD44 appeared the glandular and papillary components .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the staminal property of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.

However, this protein has been identified as a potential cancer stem cell marker in the brain, colon, prostate, pancreas, and, recently, the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Until now, the correlation between CD133 expression and clinicopathological features of tumors, like increased tumorigenic and patient survival, persist undemonstrated. Only few data in the literature describe the clinical significance of the expression patterns of CD133 (membranous and/or cytoplasmic) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u> but it is clear that aberrant overexpression is pathognomonic for neoplasia. In particular, we found as a strong uniform pattern of nuclear-cytoplasmic CD133 overexpression in the adenocomponent that had lost the CD44 membranous positivity during the glandular neoplastic transdifferentiation .\n\n【33】By PCT immunostaining, we demonstrated the epithelial origin of the tumor because PCT immunopositive-cells appeared in normal epithelium and in continuity with the external layer of the neoplasm. This suggests the primary epithelial budding of adenocarcinoma. (data not shown). CD133, prominin, increased in squamous carcinoma but more prominently in cystic-glandular neoplasia. This pattern, associated with specular behavior of CD44, can suggest the development and evolution of glandular part from squamous component.\n\n【34】By intense immunopositivity for CK7, p63, and c-kit and the particular neoplastic stromal reactivity, we hypothesized that this tumor could have EMT-like properties. Furthermore, the p63/CK7 staining has also highlighted the squamous transdifferentiation of this adnexal-like neoplasm. Since the normal basal layer of epithelium was c-kit positive like the neoplastic component, we suggest that this tumor could derive from pluripotent-like cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>, also with the support of high positivity for nestin, CD133, and CD44. Typical PCT immunostaining demonstrated the ontogenetic behavior of epithelial-adnexal neoplastic budding. In front of these original data, we suggest to reanalyze the syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum cases in the light of new evidences regarding histogenesis and stem cell-like properties.

Introduction\n\n【3】Hepatic metastases of gastric adenocarcinomas are frequently observed due to the drainage into portal vein. In addition to peritoneal metastases while it is an intraperitoneal organ, other frequent areas of dissemination include lungs due to lymphatic drainage for the tumors adjacent to esophagocardiac junction and intra-abdominal lymph nodes. Intestinal metastases disseminate from gastrocolic and mesenteric ligaments but they are seen very rarely and in most cases detected in postmortem studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In our case, a rectal metastasis of an intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma was detected without any hepatic or lymph node metastases, the first of such case in literature. We aimed in our paper to present this case of rectal metastasis from primary gastric adenocarcinoma without any other metastatic foci by assessment from clinical, radiological, pathological, and genetic perspectives in light of up-to-date literature evidence.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Material and Method\n\n【6】The patient, who had epigastric pain and constipation was examined with endoscopy and colonoscopy. In pathological evaluation there was carcinoma both in stomach and rectum. Primary diagnosis was based on two different primary tumors and metachronous metastases. Thorax and abdominal computerized tomography (CT) was performed for other organ metastases. Differential diagnosis was made by the evaluation of the morphology and immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma in stomach and rectum.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Case\n\n【8】A 74-year-old female patient with no known history of disease. Her complaints on application were epigastric pain, burning, and constipation. Gastroscopy showed a 2-cm submucosal mass in the greater curvature of fundus and in colonoscopy, a 2-3-cm mass with polypoid appearance that narrows the lumen at 10 cm in the rectum was detected. No far metastases or pathology were detected in the computer tomography of thorax/abdomen/pelvis, except thickening in the distal rectum wall and gastric wall.

Discussion\n\n【18】While the frequency of gastric cancers is gradually increased, the estimated incidence of gastric cancer in America was reported to be 21,260, and the number of deaths due to this cause was 11,210 in 2007 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In 2000, it was estimated that there were 876,340 cases of gastric cancer worldwide, resulting in approximately 650,000 deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Gastric malignancies are most frequently observed in the distal stomach (40%) and in particular in the antrum, followed by fundus and esophagogastric junction (35%) and corpus (25%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, for which adenocarcinomas again account for 90–95% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Hepatic metastases of gastric adenocarcinomas are frequently observed due to the drainage into portal vein. In addition to peritoneal metastases while it is an intraperitoneal organ, other frequent areas of dissemination include lungs due to lymphatic drainage for the tumors adjacent to esophagocardiac junction and intra-abdominal lymph nodes. Intestinal metastases disseminate from gastrocolic and mesenteric ligaments but they are seen very rarely and in most cases detected in postmortem studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Rectal metastases of gastric adenocarcinomas are reported in the literature. In these cases, intestinal metastases of poorly differentiated diffuse signet ring cell-type gastric adenocarcinomas was identified and surgical therapy and/or chemotherapy was administered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. In our case, rectum metastasis of a moderately differentiated intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma without hepatic or lymph node metastases was detected.\n\n【20】Gastroscopy is the most effective method for establishing the diagnosis of gastric cancer. It is highly valuable in diagnosis because it allows direct visualization of the tumor, cytological tests and histological biopsy. In a study issued in 1998, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative prognostic value of gastroscopy was found to be 82%, 100%, 99.1%, and 99.6%, respectively. Taking into consideration all the data, it was found to be 99.6% diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Endoscopic ultrasound is a valuable diagnostic tool in determining the invasion depth of tumor, despite being poorly successful in detecting regional lymph node metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In a study comparing imaging methods in detecting hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal cancers in 2002, sensitivity rates at equivalent specificity for MRI, CT, and US were found to be 76%, 72%, and 55%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. No findings were observed except a 1-cm cystic lesion and ascites in the abdominal US of our case. No findings in favor of metastasis were found in dynamic abdominal MRI and thoracic and abdominal CT scans. Immunohistochemical staining may be a lodestar in hepatic metastases with unknown primary focus. In a study issued in 1999, CK20 positivity was detected in 78% (94%, when adenocarcinoma metastases of gastric origin are excluded) of hepatic metastases from the malignancies originating from colon and rectum. Positive staining with CK20 was 65% extensive and 6% focal and CK7 staining was 6% positive in metastases with primary tumor in the liver. For those with primary tumor in the rectum, extensive CK20-positive staining was 83% where none was stained with CK7. Although positivity of CK20 and CK7 was detected in 74% (92%, when adenocarcinoma metastases of gastric origin are excluded) of hepatic metastases of the malignancies of pancreaticobiliary origin, variable staining patterns were seen in metastatic gastric adenocarcinomas. Gastric adenocarcinomas with hepatic metastases were stained 30% extensively and 20% focally with CK20, and 60% extensively with CK7, while 40% negatively with CK20 and CK7. Therefore, CK7 and CK20 stains do not seem to have a guidance attribution in determining the primary focus. In conclusion, a significant association was found with only CK20-positive staining between tumors originating from colon, rectum, pancreas, and biliary ducts with hepatic metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the immunohistochemical staining of gastric biopsy preparations from our case, CK20 staining in tumor cells was negative and CK7 staining was extensively strongly positive. On the other hand, mucin-positive staining indicates poorer prognosis in gastric adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In a study published in 2001, mucin-positive adenocarcinoma cases, compared with mucin-negative ones, were seen in younger patients at lower localization in the stomach, with increased cancer depth, with larger tumor diameters and higher incidences of lymph node metastasis. Also lymphatic and venous permeation were more frequent in mucin-positive staining adenocarcinomas. Comparison of lymph node metastasis in MUC-negative and -positive staining carcinomas, as the cancer invaded the submucosa, the frequency of lymph node metastasis was increased in MUC-positive staining carcinomas. In our case, in spite of MUC1-positive staining and submucosal invasion, no lymph node metastasis was detected. Another important consideration in gastric adenocarcinomas is the amplification in C-erb B2 gene (HER2/neu gene, 17q12-q21.32). Proteins that form as a result of the amplification of this gene impact cell growth, migration, and differentiation by binding to HER2/neu receptors on the cellular membrane. Trastuzumab that binds these defective proteins is included in the management of gastric cancer today 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In a study published in 2002, overexpression of the protein C-erb B2 was detected rather in well- and moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinomas and was not found in signet cell-type gastric cancers or linitis plastic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In our case, C-erb B2 gene amplification was not observed in moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinomas. Surgery is the only curative method in the treatment of localized gastric adenocarcinomas. However, chemotherapy + radiation therapy is the recognized method for advanced stage and metastatic gastric adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Cisplatin+5-FU ± Docetaxel (CF-DCF) combination is among the most favored chemotherapy modalities. In a study comparing these dual and triple regimens, addition of docetaxel to the dual CF chemotherapy is found to significantly increase the time to progression, survival, and response rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However, in an article issued in 2007, dual and triple regimens involving docetaxel are referred to produce neutropenia more frequently compared to other regimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Thus, neutropenia developed in our case following the second cure of triple DCF chemotherapy, and the treatment was resumed after decreasing the dose. In conclusion, gastric cancer is among the frequent cancers today, most of which are adenocarcinomas. Gastroscopy is the most valuable diagnostic method. Although most of the metastases are observed in the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and peritoneum, it should be remembered that intestinal metastases may be seen without the presence of any other metastatic focus. In our case, a rectal metastasis of an intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma was detected without any hepatic or lymph node metastases, the first of such case in literature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:36", "endTime": "2024/09/24 10:00:49", "cost": 12.306}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 18:00:36"}

Patients usually lack atherogenic risk factors and most commonly present with intermittent claudication in the early stages. In the later stages of undiagnosed PAES, acute ischaemia can occur as a result of complete arterial occlusion or embolism. Hence, early diagnosis and surgical release of the entrapment is crucial for good operative outcome and to prevent limb loss.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The anatomical basis of popliteal entrapment was first described by Stuart in 1879 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and the term “popliteal artery entrapment syndrome” was introduced by Love and Whelan in 1965 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The condition is more common in men with a male-to-female ratio of 15 : 1 and can sometimes be bilateral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Its true incidence is unknown but varies between 0.2%–3.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. PAES is mostly found in young sportsmen or soldiers with well-developed muscles and has even been described in military personnel who operate armored vehicles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Typical patients are young and, therefore, lack the risk factors that would predispose them to atherosclerosis. The lack of such risk factors is the main reason for diagnostic delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The following case report outlines an unusual presentation of unilateral popliteal artery entrapment syndrome and delves into the importance of early diagnosis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 24-year-old fit-and-healthy ex-army officer presented with a two-day history of a cold, numb, and painful left lower leg; he had been doing vigorous exercises two days prior to admission. Over the past few months, the patient had experienced similar worsening leg pain after running long distances. Apart from smoking (5 pack years), the patient had no other significant cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed a regular heart rate of 60 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg. There was no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm. Examination of the right leg was unremarkable. On the left side, there were normal palpable femoral and popliteal pulses, but no palpable distal pulses. The left foot also appeared paler; however, motor and sensory functions were intact.\n\n【7】An angiogram revealed a thrombotic occlusion of the proximal half of the popliteal artery and a small embolus in the mid-peroneal artery . Intraarterial thrombolysis (Alteplase) was commenced. A 24-hour followup angiogram showed a reduction in the size of the thrombus; however, there was still a stricture at the midpopliteal artery with an irregularity of the wall. The stricture was accentuated with the foot in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. At 48 hours, the angiogram demonstrated that the thrombus had largely resolved; however, the stricture was still present. The site of stenosis was angioplastied which resulted in a marked improvement in blood flow.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Angiogram of the left leg before thrombolysis, showing complete occlusion of the popliteal artery. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】An MRI scan was subsequently performed and showed the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle going between the popliteal artery and vein where it inserted in a more lateral position . Having excluded bilateral disease on the MRI, the patient underwent surgery-division of the medial head of gastrocnemius with autogenous saphenous vein interposition graft. A postoperative duplex scan showed that the vein graft was patent with pulsatile signals. The patient’s recovery was uneventful and he was discharged 3 weeks after hospitalisation.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Axial T1-weighted MRI images through both knees at the level of the popliteal fossa showing the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle (white arrow) going between the popliteal artery (white arrow head) and vein (black arrow head). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Various classifications of PAES exist in the literature. The most commonly used one was proposed by Whelan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and divides this condition into five types . Our patient was affected by Type II PAES .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Table 1 Classification of PAES 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>.</u>\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Type 2 PAES. The medial head of gastrocnemius muscle is attached more laterally. The popliteal artery courses medially and under the gastrocnemius muscle insertion. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【15】The presenting symptoms are variable and include leg swelling, aching pain, rest pain, and cramping of the calf. Physical signs are usually absent at rest, until complications develop. In young persons, symptoms are limited to intermittent claudication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and this is due to the intermittent compression of the artery during plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. Chronic extrinsic arterial compression leads to vascular microtrauma, early arteriosclerosis, and subsequent thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Thrombus formation, in the later stages of PAES, may cause complete obstruction of the popliteal artery leading to acute limb-threatening ischaemia; this is commonly seen in patients who have not developed sufficient collateral circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Hence, this condition needs to be included in the list of diagnoses in young patients who present with symptoms of peripheral vascular disease.\n\n【16】Angiography is the classical screening and diagnostic tool in PAES 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It can demonstrate compression of the popliteal artery with the ankle plantar flexed. Gourgiotis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> pointed out that an irregularity of the wall of the popliteal artery (in an otherwise normal arterial tree) should also raise suspicion of PAES. Transverse T1-weighted MR imaging is useful to evaluate the aberrant muscular anatomy of the popliteal fossa and also to demonstrate the deviation of the popliteal artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The most common and successful treatment option is muscle division to release the entrapment. If there is significant delay in diagnosis, the popliteal artery may become occluded, stenotic, or aneurysmal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In such complicated cases, division of the anomalous musculotendinous structure and vascular reconstruction is generally required.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】PAES is a rare but potentially limb-threatening condition affecting predominantly young male adults. This syndrome is difficult to diagnose and, therefore, poses a diagnostic pitfall. Awareness of this entity is a prerequisite for correct and prompt diagnosis. Careful history and physical examination is of utmost importance. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute popliteal artery occlusion or claudication in young patients with no cardiovascular risk factors. Early surgical intervention to release the popliteal artery is the treatment of choice and is important for good operative outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:30", "endTime": "2024/09/24 09:47:50", "cost": 20.458}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-20 01:30:33", "update_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-23 17:47:27"}
