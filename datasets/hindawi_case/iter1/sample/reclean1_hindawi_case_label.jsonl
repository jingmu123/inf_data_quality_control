However, migration of the inserted stent can occur, either distally or proximally; proximal migration is less common, but it also presents a greater challenge for endoscopic resolution. We present a case of a 67-year-old woman who had locally advanced pancreatic cancer and developed a common bile duct obstruction. Upon clinical presentation of chronic, painless, progressive jaundice, the obstruction was managed by placing of a 10 mm × 60 mm covered self-expandable metal stent (CSEMS), which successfully facilitated palliative biliary drainage. Six months later, however, the patient developed recurrent jaundice, which was determined to be due to proximal migration of the CSEMS. Repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed, and initial attempts to retrieve the migrated stent failed. Finally, another 10 mm × 60 mm CSEMS was placed across the stricture site, inside the previous stent, which remained in place. The treatment resolved the obstruction and jaundice, and the patient experienced no adverse events.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Endoscopic biliary decompression via stent placement is an important modality for the palliative management of distal malignant biliary obstruction. The demonstrated longer stent patency of self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs), over that of the plastic-type stent, underlies the physicians’ preference for their use, especially for cases in which the patient’s survival is expected to be longer than 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Many different designs of SEMSs are available, and in use, worldwide; these include uncovered, partially covered, and fully covered SEMSs. The choice of the specific SEMS type to be used is made on a case-by-case basis, usually by the endoscopist, based on the biliary pathological characteristics of the patients, including etiology, location of the obstruction, and institutional availability of the various SEMS types. The potential of SEMS malfunction is related to postplacement events, including stent migration or occlusion, and SEMSs can ever lead to life-threatening complications, such as stent-induced ulceration, duodenal obstruction, and perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. For stent migration, many studies have demonstrated that covered SEMSs (CSEMSs) migrate more frequently than uncovered SEMSs (USEMSs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. To resolve this issue, endoscopic techniques, using foreign body forceps, biopsy forceps, or polypectomy snares, have been used for stent retrieval. Stents can move either distally or proximally, and while proximal movement occurs less frequently, it presents a more difficult situation for endoscopic removal.\n\n【4】Here, we report an alternative endoscopic approach for the management of proximally migrated CSEMSs that was successfully applied in a case of malignant distal common bile duct obstruction, in which the endoscopist had failed to retrieve the stent; placement of another CSEMS was performed distally using a stent-in-stent technique after navigating through the previous CSEMS with a guidewire.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 67-year-old woman presented to our department with a complaint of a 3-week history of progressive painless jaundice. Laboratory tests revealed no leukocytosis but mild anemia (hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL, reference range: 12.0–18.0 g/dL). The liver chemistry panel revealed the following: aspartate aminotransferase: 38 U/L (reference range: 0–32 U/L); alanine aminotransferase: 31 U/L (reference range: 0–33 U/L); total bilirubin: 18.8 mg/dL (reference range: 0.0–1.2 mg/dL); direct bilirubin: 16.4 mg/dL (reference range: 0.0–0.3 mg/dL); alkaline phosphatase: 252 U/L (reference range: 35–105 U/L); and carbohydrate antigen 19–9: <0.6 U/mL (reference range: 0–39 U/mL). A computed tomography scan demonstrated an ill-defined mass at the pancreatic head (4.0 cm × 4.2 cm in size) causing distal common bile duct and pancreatic duct dilatation . The tumor encased the superior mesenteric vein and multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies were also apparent.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Computed tomography scan showing an ill-defined, hypodense mass at the pancreatic head, causing upstream dilatation of the common bile duct (a) and pancreatic duct (b) compatible with the double duct sign.</u>\n\n【8】After the cytological assessment (using endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration) indicated adenocarcinoma, a locally advanced pancreatic malignancy was diagnosed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) was subsequently performed and showed a long-segment stricture at the distal common bile duct that caused upstream dilatation (1.5 cm in diameter, together with dilations of the bilateral intrahepatic ducts; Figure 2(a)). The obstructive jaundice was resolved by placing a 10 mm × 60 mm fully covered SEMS (Niti-S Biliary Covered Stent™; TaeWoong Medical Co, Ltd. Gimposi, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), which facilitated biliary drainage 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. The patient received palliative chemotherapy, consisting of cycles of a cisplatin and gemcitabine regimen.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Cholangiography showing a long-segment stricture at the distal common bile duct. (a) The stricture caused upstream dilatation of the distal common bile duct; (b) after the placement of a fully covered self-expandable metal stent.</u>\n\n【10】Six months later, the patient presented with complaints of recurrent jaundice and was referred for ERC. A computed tomography scan demonstrated proximal migration of the previously placed CSEMS , and the patient was scheduled for endoscopic intervention. In the endoscopy suite, the cholangiogram verified proximal migration and showed upstream dilation of the common bile duct . The initial attempts to retrieve the migrated stent endoscopically by using rat tooth grasping forceps (Rat Tooth Alligator Jaw Grasping Forceps; Olympus Medical System Corporation, Aomori, Japan) and snares (Captivator™ Single-Use Snare, Boston Scientific Corporation, Costa Rica) failed. As a result, deep cannulation using a sphincterotome (Ultratome™ XL Triple Lumen; Boston Scientific Corporation, Costa Rica) was performed by navigating a 0.035-inch guidewire (Jagwire™, Boston Scientific Corporation, Costa Rica) until passage through the previous CSEMS was achieved proximally. A 12-mm balloon retrieval catheter (Extractor<sup>TM</sup> Pro RX Balloon, Boston Scientific Limited, Ireland) was then inserted over the guidewire and inflated within the migrated stent to confirm proper location of the guidewire. Then, retrieval of the migrated stent was attempted by pulling the balloon back distally, but the attempt failed. Finally, an additional 10 cm × 60 mm CSEMS (Niti-S Biliary Covered Stent™; TaeWoong Medical Co, Ltd. Gimposi, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) was placed across the stricture site, inside the previous stent. Satisfactory drainage was achieved .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Computed tomography scan performed after the patient developed recurrent obstructive jaundice showing proximal migration of the previously placed metallic stent (a).

At the follow-up 2 weeks after the procedure, the bilirubin level was normal. The patient refused the recommended chemotherapy and passed away 5 months later without recurrent episodes of jaundice.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】The majority of malignant distal common bile duct strictures are caused by pancreaticobiliary cancers. It has been reported that up to 80% of patients with pancreatic carcinoma develop obstructive jaundice; unfortunately, most of these patients have advanced-stage disease at the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Endoscopic biliary drainage via biliary stenting is the most common approach for addressing the issue of obstructive jaundice and can improve the quality of life of the patient, regardless of the predicted cancer-related survival time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. SEMSs have gained popularity among treating physicians, as they have longer stent patency than plastic-type stents, which are prone to occlusion by microbacterial biofilm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Nevertheless, SEMSs harbor their own disadvantages; for example, USEMSs can be occluded due to tumor ingrowth through the mesh 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. CSEMSs have better patency than USEMSs due to their thin, nonporous membrane, which is located inside of their mesh and prevents tumor ingrowth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. The disadvantage of CSEMSs, however, is their lower axial force, which leads to an increased risk of migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Unfortunately, the multitude of studies comparing CSEMSs and USEMSs to determine which is superior for the treatment of malignancy distal biliary obstruction have yielded conflicting results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10, 12, 13\\]</u>. Adding to the controversy, a prospective randomized trial published in 2010 showed no significant difference in stent patency between CSEMSs and USEMSs for the palliative treatment of distal malignant biliary obstruction, but confirmed that tumor ingrowth was more common in USEMSs and that CSEMSs had an increased risk of stent migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Stent migration is a well-known clinical problem, affecting 1.8% to 11.5% of biliary stent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9, 10, 12, 13\\]</u>. When stented patients develop recurrent obstructive jaundice or cholangitis, migration should be among the first events suspected. Proximal migration is much less common than distal migration, reportedly affecting only 1.7% of partially covered SEMSs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Regardless of the migration pattern, several techniques for retrieval have been described in the literature, including the use of foreign body forceps, biopsy forceps, polypectomy snares, or Dormia baskets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In our patient, the initial attempt to remove the proximally migrated CSEMS was carried out with several of the commonly used accessories, all of which failed. Since the upper border of the migrated stent was still wide open, the endoscopist decided to abandon removal of the migrated stent and instead place another stent across the stricture point, using a stent-in-stent technique. No stent-related complications were observed in the patient following the procedure, including the most common complication, cholecystitis, which occurs in up to 10% of patients after SEMS placement and is associated with preexisting cystic duct lesions, such as cholelithiasis or tumor invasion of the cystic duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】The proximal migration of a fully covered self-expandable metal stent in patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction occurs less frequently than distal migration and presents a more difficult situation for endoscopic removal. The stent-in-stent technique is an alternative treatment approach in cases where endoscopist had failed to retrieve the stent.\n\n【22】#### Abbreviations\n\n| SEMS: | Self-expandable metal stent |\n| --- | --- |\n| CSEMS: | Covered self-expandable metal stent |\n| USEMS: | Uncovered self-expandable metal stent |\n| ERC: | Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Surgery is suggested in presence of a solitary nodule or few unilateral nodules. Instead if the lesions are unresectable or multiple and bilateral several chemotherapy protocols have been used. The prognosis is variable with a median survival of 4-5 years.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 67-year-old Caucasian man, lifelong nonsmoker, with no prior history of lung diseases, was referred to our university hospital for the presence, in the last 3 months, of exertion dyspnoea (grade 1 according to the Medical Research Council scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>) and dry cough. He had worked as an employee without occupational exposures of clinical relevance. His past medical history was characterized by an herniated lumbar disc, systemic arterial hypertension (treated with calcium blockers), diabetes mellitus (treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents), and polycythemia vera (diagnosed in 2007 and treated from 2008 with hydroxyurea). Physical examination was unremarkable. Arterial blood gases analysis performed with the patient breathing room air demonstrated normal values (pH 7.40, PaCO<sub>2</sub> 43 mmHg, PaO<sub>2</sub> 91 mmHg, and bicarbonate level 26 mmoL/L). Routine laboratory tests were within the normal range except for those listed in Table 1. Serum levels of neoplastic markers were within normal range, including carcinoembryonic antigen (2.7 ng/mL), prostate-specific antigen (3.75 ng/mL), and CA19.9 (15 U/mL). Also the serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (11 IU/mL) and β<sub>2</sub> microglobulin (2.50 mg/mL) were within normal limits.\n\n【6】Table 1 Laboratory tests concerning diabetes mellitus and polycythemia vera.\n\n【7】The pulmonary function tests showed the presence of a restrictive pattern with a vital capacity (VC) of 3.14 litres (70% of the predicted value), a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.11 litres (72% of the predicted value), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 2.55 litres (76.5% of predicted value), a FEV<sub>1</sub>/VC ratio of 81% (108% of the predicted value) and a total lung capacity (TLC), 5.35 litres (73.3% of the predicted value).

Histopathological examination of the resected tissue revealed round- to oval-shaped nodules, with a central sclerotic, hypocellular zone, and peripheral zone rich of cells. There was tumour diffusion into the adjacent bronchioles and the alveolar spaces with micropolypoid aspects. The extracellular stroma consisted of an abundant matrix of chondroid, hyaline, mucinous, or myxomatous appearance.\n\n【15】The neoplastic cells were of polygonal shape and eosinophilic with round nuclei and uniform small to moderately sized nucleoli.

Discussion\n\n【20】Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH) is a rare, low- to intermediate-grade tumor of endothelial origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma can arise from many organs, including lungs, liver, bone, and soft tissue, simultaneously or sequentially. When this occurs, it may be difficult to determinate if the tumor is multicentric from the beginning or there is a primary lesion with metastases to the other tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Around 120 cases have been reported in literature 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[2, Table 2\\]</u>, only five of them were in Italian patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 15–18\\]</u>. Mean (SD) age of patients is 40.1 (17.5) years, and 73% are females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Interestingly, our patient is instead a 67-year-old male. Most patients are asymptomatic at presentation, and some are complaining of weight loss, fatigue, dyspnoea, fever, pleuritic chest pain, mild nonproductive cough, and haemoptysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In most cases, the physical examination is normal, but few cases of digital clubbing and pleural effusions have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Table 2 Review of the clinical, radiological and pathological features of the published cases of primary pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.\n\n【22】The most characteristic feature of PEH on chest radiographs or CT is the presence of multiple perivascular nodules with well- or ill-defined margins in both lungs. The nodules may range in size up to 2 cm, but most of them are ≤1 cm in diameter; they are usually found near medium-sized vessels and bronchi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This radiological presentation is suggestive of many lung diseases .\n\n【23】Table 3 Differential diagnosis of multiple pulmonary bilateral nodules.\n\n【24】Some authors consider 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography an important tool for PEH diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>; however, in our patient, the PET was negative, suggesting that a negative PET cannot exclude PEH. Unfortunately, we do not have a molecular explanation for this finding but may be related to a low proliferation rate of the neoplastic cells.\n\n【25】The diagnosis of PEH is made on the basis of the histopathological features and confirmed using immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cell markers, such as against factor VIII-related von Willebrand antigen, CD31 or CD34 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 13, 20, 21\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The prognosis is variable. The 5-year survival is around 60% (range 47–71%). In fact, there are two groups of PEH at the clinical presentation: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> one asymptomatic, with a solitary pulmonary nodule or unilateral multiple nodules. Usually they can be managed with surgery alone, and lymphatic invasion is unlikely. Their prognosis is good with a median survival of more than 10 years; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> another symptomatic group presents with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules or pleural effusion with scarce response to chemotherapy. The prognosis of this group is poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Most patients die from pulmonary insufficiency as a result of an increasing number of tumor nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Hematogeneous metastases are rare and have been described especially in the liver but also in other sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The treatment of PEH is not standardized. Surgery alone is indicated in the presence of a single pulmonary nodule or unilateral multiple nodules. Lung transplantation should be considered in patients with vascular infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Various chemotherapies have been reported for unresectable or metastatic PEH, with variable effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Other authors have suggested a role for the hormonal therapy (antiestrogens and progesterone) in patients with diffuse disease if the neoplastic cells express estrogen and progesterone receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. A slight regression of the pulmonary lesions was also obtained with interferon (IFN)-2α, probably for its antiangiogenic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.

Glaucoma is associated in 50% of the patients. Craniofacial and dental anomalies are frequently reported with ARS. The present study was designed as a multidisciplinary analysis of orthodontic, ophthalmologic, and genotypical features. A three-generation pedigree was ascertained through a family with ARS. Clinically, radiographic and genetic analyses were performed. Despite an identical genotype in all patients, the phenotype varies in expressivity of craniofacial and dental morphology. Screening for PITX2 and FOXC1 mutations by direct DNA-sequencing revealed a P64L missense mutation in PITX2 in all family members, supporting earlier reports that PITX2 is an essential factor in morphogenesis of teeth and craniofacial skeleton. Despite the fact that the family members had identical mutations, morphologic differences were evident. The concomitant occurrence of rare dental and craniofacial anomalies may be early diagnostic indications of ARS. Early detection of ARS and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) helps to prevent visual field loss.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) (OMIM Nr.: 180500) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder (1  :  200000) with variable morphology characterized by malformations of the anterior segment of the eye such as Iris hypoplasia, iridocorneal adhesions, corectopia, polycoria, and embryotoxon posterius. Glaucoma is associated in 50% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Craniofacial, dental, and umbilical anomalies are also regularly reported in connection with ARS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Characteristic craniofacial features are maxillary hypoplasia, hypertelorism, and telecanthus. Dental features include hypodontia/oligodontia of primary and permanent dentition, microdontia, short roots, taurodontism, and abnormally shaped teeth.\n\n【4】Other systemic features like anomalies of the pituitary gland, middle ear deafness, heart defects, hypospadia, short stature, and mental retardation were diagnosed in several ARS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Three genetic loci have been associated with ARS so far. The genes FOXC1 and PITX2 encode transcription factors and are located on chromosomes 6p25 and 4q25, respectively. A third locus for ARS was mapped to chromosome 13q14 but the gene has not yet been identified. Therefore ARS has to be considered as a morphologically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and genetically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> heterogeneous disorder.\n\n【6】In recent years there has been increasing focus on the clinical as well as a the molecular-genetic aspects of ARS.

The film-focus distance was 150 cm and the distance from the midsagittal plane to the film was 10 cm, resulting in an enlargement factor of 15%. Angular and linear measurements were made from each cephalogram. The position of the maxilla and mandible Was analyzed by the respective SNA and SNB angles. The skeletal configuration was defined by the Wits appraisal (the AB/Occlusal Plane angle). A metric analysis was done for the length of the maxilla and the mandible.

Review of the Literature\n\n【42】In twelve published case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 12–22\\]</u> descriptions of the dental and craniofacial phenotype of 17 ARS patients who were examined by an ophthalmologist and a dentist are given.\n\n【43】When the four cases examined in the present study are included, 21 patients have been evaluated up to now.\n\n【44】All the patients presented with hypodontia. These findings were documented in either the primary or permanent dentition depending on the age of the patient.\n\n【45】In 15 out of the 21 cases a detailed description of agenesis of permanent teeth was available. In the remaining 6 cases only the total number of missing teeth was reported, ranging from 3 to as many as 20. The teeth most frequently missing were the upper lateral incisors as well as the upper and lower second premolars. Other teeth whose absence was reported were central incisors, canines, first premolars, and first and second molars. Teeth of the upper jaw tended to be missing more frequently .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 9 | Frequency of agenesis of permanent upper teeth in 15 patients with ARS and hypodontia. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 10 | Frequency of agenesis of permanent lower teeth in 15 patients with ARS and hypodontia. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【48】Data on congenital absence of primary teeth were available in 11 out of 21 cases. The teeth most often absent were the upper and lower deciduous incisors, missing in 40% and 18% of the patients, respectively.\n\n【49】Microdontia has been observed in 17 patients. In 6 patients only maxillary teeth were affected, in 11 patients teeth in both jaws were hypoplastic. Three patients displayed generalized microdontia of all teeth. The teeth series most often affected was the upper and lower incisors, followed by premolars, canines, and molars. Other dental anomalies reported included taurodontism, enamel hypoplasia, short roots, paraplasia, and delayed eruption.\n\n【50】Maxillary hypoplasia was present in 19 out of 21 patients (90.5%), resulting in a Class III facial profile combined with a flat midface, concave facial profile, receding upper lip, or prominent lower lip.\n\n【51】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【52】Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome is a very rare condition. Thus, the number of patients studied is limited. In addition, this disease shows morphologic variability in terms of frequency and expression of associated anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5, 6\\]</u>. Therefore, a detailed presentation of dental and craniofacial anomalies in patients with ARS is necessary. In our previous study of 26 patients with ARS and glaucoma or ocular hypertension, dentofacial anomalies were evident in 27% of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This is consistent with the studies by Shields et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and Ozeki et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> on 24 and 21 patients with ARS, respectively.\n\n【53】Our patients show a missense mutation in the PITX2 gene. PITX2 is a transcription factor controlling the expression of other genes during development. This factor is essential for correct differentiation and migration of cells developing tissues and organs. Expression of PITX2 in mice has been found in periocular mesenchyme, maxillary, mandibular and dental epithelia, umbilicus, Rathke’s pouch, and vitelline vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【54】PITX2 has been identified as an activator of the Dlx2 gene that is also expressed in maxillary and mandibular and dental epithelia. Dlx2 is part of the “odontogenic homeobox code” essential for tooth and craniofacial development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Therefore dental anomalies in ARS patients can be explained by PITX2 mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Depending on the transactivation ability of a PITX2 mutant different phenotypes from mild Iris hypoplasia to the whole spectrum of ARS including severe dental and craniofacial anomalies have been observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【55】In normal Caucasian population hypodontia occurs in males with an incidence of 4.6%, in females of 6.3%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. The teeth most often absent are the lower second premolars followed by the upper lateral incisors and the upper second premolars with a frequency of 1.5%–3.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. By contrast, all of our ARS patients presented with hypodontia. Moreover, two of the siblings exhibited very rare types of tooth agenesis, such as of an upper canine in patient 3 and of upper molars in patient 4, respectively.\n\n【56】Microdontia also seems to be a characteristic finding in ARS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In all of our patients a conical shape of the upper central incisors was reported. Additionally, in patient 4 microdontic lower molars were found which is a very rare condition in general population with an incidence of 0.1%–0.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【57】Taurodontism occurs in approximately 0.3% of the white European population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. In patient 4 all molars were affected. This finding supports the hypothesis of previous reports that taurodontism is one of the characteristic dental anomalies in ARS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【58】The observed root resorption in two of the siblings may indicate a higher risk of root resorption in ARS patients during orthodontic treatment.\n\n【59】The four presented cases underwent cephalometric analysis in order to evaluate the craniofacial morphology.\n\n【60】Three of the patients exhibited a severe skeletal Class III malocclusion caused by maxillary retrognathia associated with a shortened maxilla. In contrast, mandibular position was in an almost normal range.\n\n【61】The extent of skeletal Class III in our ARS patients was similar to the severity of hypodontia and other dental anomalies. Patient 3 with an agenesis of seven permanent teeth exhibited the most distinctive dysgnathia, whereas patient 2 with agenesis of the upper lateral incisors exhibited almost orthognathic jaw relationships. Drum et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> concluded that an alveolar hypoplasia resulting from missing teeth contributes to a maxillary deficiency. In the present study it seems that the number of missing teeth may play a certain role in the extent of maxillary hypoplasia. However, the reduced maxillary length deficiency seen in our ARS patients is not exclusively limited to the alveolar region but also is evident in the maxillary base. Therefore, maxillary hypoplasia may not completely be explained by the number of congenitally absent teeth. It can be assumed that additional craniofacial factors may influence maxillary growth in ARS patients. Childers and Wright 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> also hypothesied that midface hypoplasia associated with ARS is a combination of skeletal and dentoalveolar factors.\n\n【62】Early diagnosis of ARS and control of IOP is essential to prevent visual impairment. Ophthalmologists, paediatricians, dentists, and orthodontists have to be aware that ARS is an inherited autosomal dominant anomaly and therefore all family members have to be screened as early as possible. Despite this fact, ARS frequently is diagnosed late. Even hypoplasia of the iris, visible without special instruments, does not reduce the mean age at diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition, two of the patients included in this study were diagnosed only after symptoms of elevated IOP were noticed by the patients themselves.\n\n【63】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【64】Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a very rare disorder with genetic and morphologic variability. The concomitant occurrence of rare dental and craniofacial anomalies in these patients, such as hypoplasia of the central incisors, rare types of tooth agenesis such as an upper canine or upper molars associated with maxillary retrognathia, and a skeletal Class III may be indications of ARS. Early detection of ARS and measuring potentially elevated intraocular pressure helps physicians to prevent visual field loss.\n\n【65】The data used in this report are based on the dissertation “Phänotyp und Genotyp des Axenfeld- Rieger- Syndroms” by P.

Metastatic bone disease represents a systemic pathology that heavily affects the quality of life of oncologic patients causing pain and functional disability. Methodology. We present the case of a patient with a history of renal cell cancer presenting pathologic fractures of both humeri and proximal right radius. Results. After a careful multidisciplinary approach, an adjuvant anticancer therapy and a photodynamic bone stabilization procedure were performed with a minimally invasive technique aiming to minimize pain and local disease progression, while restoring functional autonomy and improving the patient’s quality of life. Electrochemotherapy was delivered on the lytic bone lesions with extraskeletal involvement of the proximal left humerus and the proximal right radius, and then polymeric bone stabilization was performed on both humeri. At two months of follow-up, the patient presented satisfactory functional scores (MSTS score: 12/30 bilaterally; DASH scores: 46.7/100 for the right side and 48.3/100 for the left one), and pain was well controlled with opioid analgesics. Radiographs showed good results in terms of ossification of lytic bone lesions and durability of polymeric stabilization. At four months of follow-up, the patient reported a stable clinical scenario. Six months after surgery, due to extremely poor prognosis after the progression of primary disease, the patient was referred to palliative care and died shortly thereafter. Conclusion. Over the last decade, the management of metastatic bone disease has changed. Low-toxicity and minimally invasive procedures such as electrochemotherapy and polymeric bone stabilization might be performed concomitantly in selected patients, as an alternative to radiation therapy and to more demanding surgical procedures such as plating and adjuvant cementing.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The most common cause of destructive bone lesions is metastatic cancer. Bone is the third most common site for metastasis after lung and liver, while prostate, breast, lung, renal, and thyroid cancer account for around 80% of all skeletal metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Bone metastases are commonly associated with a high morbidity burden that heavily affects the quality of life of oncologic patients. Severe pain can be experienced due to bone pain and compression of spinal cord or nerve roots, and it requires adequate multidisciplinary treatment that can include narcotic analgesics, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bisphosphonate. Surgery is mainly indicated in nonresponding tumors or when pain is not controlled with medical treatment. Around 10–25% of patients present with an impending or actual pathologic fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, often requiring surgery and representing a catastrophic event for these patients. In addition to the fracture-related complications that could lead to immobilization, possible surgery, and consequent suspension of tumor-related treatments, other possible negative effects such as contamination of adjacent joint, soft tissue, nerves, and vessels by hematoma formation, or distant hematogenous dissemination due to microcirculation damages must be considered. Around 30% of the patients with renal cell cancer eventually develop bone metastases, and these are associated with worse overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Renal cancer bone metastases are usually lytic and highly hypervascular and cause technical issues especially during surgical management when the surgeon must face difficulties in achieving bone stability for pain control. Preoperative embolization is often required to minimize blood loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>, and whenever radical surgery is not indicated, minimally invasive palliative treatments, such as electrochemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, high intensity focus ultrasound, and photodynamic polymer bone stabilization, have become more and more popular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>.\n\n【4】At our institution, an Orthopedic Oncologic Department of a national reference center for musculoskeletal tumor surgery, the concomitant use of electrochemotherapy and a polymeric intramedullary stabilization system was chosen to treat multiple bone metastases of upper limbs in a multimetastatic renal cancer case.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A nonsmoker 60-year-old woman with a history of hiatal hernia with Barrett’s esophagus and depression was admitted to the Emergency Department due to persistent fever during the last month. Blood tests, ultrasounds (US), and computed tomography (CT) imaging showed an 8 cm right mesorenal cancer with infiltration of the perirenal fat, urinary collecting system, and renal sinus. Moreover, the presence of floating thrombus in the right renal vein up to the inferior caval vein was detected, while the absence of a cleavage plane with the lower face of the liver was reported. Radical right nephrectomy and homolateral renal vein thrombectomy were performed after 15 days from diagnosis. Histological examination revealed a pT3a G4 N1 clear cell renal cancer with extensive pleomorphic and rhabdoid aspects. A week after surgery, the patient suffered from left pulmonary thromboembolism, which required anticoagulant therapy. An acute pain at the left arm and right forearm occurred two months after surgery with no history of relevant trauma. Pathologic fractures were found in both the diaphysis of the left humerus and the proximal metaphysis of the right radius. The patient showed pain (NRS score 8/10 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>), swelling, and both upper limbs’ complete limitation of movement plus systemic fatigue and poor appetite. No fever was detected. The peripheral blood erythrocyte count was below 3 × 10<sup>12</sup>/L, and hemoglobin was around 95 g/L. The Karnofsky score was 30. After hospital admission, the patient received parenteral nutrition, analgesics, and other symptomatic treatments. Oral anticoagulant therapy was suspended and replaced with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) therapy. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, the patient was addressed for surgery. While undergoing the routine preoperative workups, a spontaneous diaphyseal fracture of the right humerus occurred. Preoperative radiographs 通用删除1(英):<u>(as in Figure 1)</u> demonstrated the fractures and wide lytic lesions involving the left humerus and the proximal right radius and confirmed the pathologic fracture of the right humerus. A CT scan of the thorax and abdomen was performed, and no secondary lesions were detected apart from the bone localizations. An additional CT scan of the upper limbs was performed to refine the surgical indication . Large osteolytic lesions with soft tissue invasion, involving the proximal left humerus and the proximal right radius were noticed. Our approach consisted of delivering a local adjuvant therapy on the lesions of the left humerus and right radius with electrochemotherapy using Cliniporator VITAE® technology (IGEA Spa; Carpi, MO, Italy). Thus, closed reduction and intramedullary fixation using a photodynamic polymeric stabilization system (IlluminOss® -IlluminOss Medical GmbH; Hilden, Germany) of both humeri was performed. The patient underwent general anesthesia and the entire procedure in a supine position. To treat both intraosseous and extraskeletal components of the lesions, electrochemotherapy was applied as follows: 4 and 7 single long (16 cm) needle VGD-1830T16 electrodes (variable geometry) with 1.8 mm in diameter and 3 cm active part were positioned around the right radial lesion and the left humeral lesion, respectively, and then the patient received a bolus of bleomycin (Bleomycin Nippon-Kayaku, Sanofi-Aventis, vials 15 mg, 15,000 UI/m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area). Eight minutes after the infusion, to allow the drug diffusion into the tumour tissues, electric pulses were applied (electroporation) according to the standard operating procedures. A single train of eight electric pulses of 100 µs of duration at 1000 V/cm was generated by the Cliniporator Vitae® (IGEA spa Carpi). Afterwards, a small incision was performed anterolaterally to the acromion process of the left scapula, the deltoid muscle was split longitudinally to expose the subdeltoid bursa, and then the supraspinatus tendon was incised in line with its fibers. The fracture was reduced with the aid of an intramedullary guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance and the canal prepared with flexible cannulated reamers. Thus, the Dacron® balloon catheter was inserted, and the monomer was infused. The light source was finally used to activate the monomer, the tissues were closed in layers, and the correct position of the implant was checked by fluoroscopy. When the stability of the left humerus was reached, the contralateral fracture was internally stabilized with the same photodynamic bone stabilization system. After the operation, the right arm was immobilized with a long splint for 20 days, while arm slings were positioned bilaterally. Passive mobilization was prescribed from the first day following the operation, active elevation of the arms was restricted for the first 20 days, while lifting and strength-training were prohibited for a period of six weeks. The postoperative period was complicated by anemia, and five blood units were given to the patient. The pain was controlled with the administration of oral oxycodone/naloxone 5 mg/2.5 mg combination every 12 hours. After oncological examination, 24 days after surgery, a systemic treatment with pazopanib 400 mg once a day was prescribed, and the patient was discharged to an outpatient rehabilitative long-term care ward. Two months following the operation, a clinical follow-up reported that all surgical scars were well healed, and the range of motion was acceptable for low-impact daily activities. Anterior elevation and abduction of both shoulders were around 90°, internal rotation was limited to the buttock, while the elbows demonstrated full range of motion bilaterally. While slight pain (NRS score 3/10) was reported during the mobilization of the left shoulder, no pain was evocable by palpation of the treated bone lesions or at rest (NRS score 0/10). Nonetheless, the patient continued the same opioid dosage as at hospital discharge. MSTS score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> was 12/30 (40%) bilaterally, while DASH scores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> were 46.7 and 48.3 for the right and left side, respectively. Along with the clinical examination, radiographs were performed  and showed no secondary mobilization of the implants, an initial callus formation, and new ossification processes. A radiographic partial response with a reduction of approximately 30% of the lesions’ diameters was reported (RECIST criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>). In conjunction with the oncologic team, the administration of pazopanib was confirmed, and a further clinical and radiological follow-up was scheduled at 6 months from surgery. At 4 months after surgery, the patient was contacted by telephone and reported substantial stability of the clinical scenario with well-controlled pain by mild opioid analgesics. At 6 months after surgery, a follow-up chest and abdomen CT exam detected lymph node infiltration of the caudate lobe of the liver and bone progression of disease. Furthermore, neck and supraclavicular lymph node metastases were reported. The oncologist suspended the treatment with pazopanib, and palliative care was initiated. The patient died within a month. This case report was approved by the United Ethical Committee of “AOU Città della Salute e della Scienza,” Turin, Italy, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The patient signed an informed consent form and authorized the use of data for research purposes.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Preoperative radiographs demonstrating simultaneous lytic lesions and pathologic fractures of upper limbs secondary to a renal cell cancer.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Preoperative CT scans demonstrating a large extraskeletal mass in the proximal left humerus causing a pathologic fracture, while a second lytic lesion is visible distally.

Discussion\n\n【12】The treatment of the multimetastatic patients has changed radically over the last 20 years: several surgical treatments have been introduced to control pain, maintain independent living, and improve the quality of life, along with improved medical treatments that target the prevention of tumor progression. Surgery is typically employed for impending fracture or for actual pathologic fractures, but when surgery is not indicated, fractionated radiation therapy (8 Gy/1f or 30 Gy/10f) is offered as first-line treatment. However, radiation therapy is not effective in around 30% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, and reaching of the maximum dose limits its usage. Moreover, patients might suffer from intolerance in the surrounding tissues and from weakening of the healthy bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient treated with internal fixation of pathologic fractures with an intramedullary polymeric stabilization system combined with simultaneous electrochemotherapy of upper limbs. The rationale was to apply adjuvant therapy to both the intraosseous and extraskeletal components to control tumor progression and pain, while providing immediate stability of the pathologic fractures with a minimally invasive surgical technique. In case of multimetastatic bone disease, the main objective of palliative treatments is to restore a partial/complete function controlling the pain and not always to reduce lesion size dimensions. Electrochemotherapy is based on the local intake of a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent (usually bleomycin) by means of electric pulses delivered to the tumor nodule via suitable sets of electrodes. Changes to the cell membrane potential determine the establishment of a transient passage: electroporation is induced, and water and charged molecules, such as some anticancer drugs, can pass through the cell membrane’s newly formed pores, into the cells’ interior. Such pores are established rapidly and disappear within minutes depending on the electric field amplitude 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In vivo studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–19\\]</u> demonstrated that, after exposure to the electric field, the tumor’s blood flow decreases up to 80% for about 24 hours allowing the cytotoxic agent to stay within the tumor for several hours and possibly determining a vascular-disrupting effect on the targeted cells. Electrochemotherapy’s range of applications is extensive and includes cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases, melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma, and liver and bone metastases; in addition, some clinical trials have been conducted on selected primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Even if the treatment of bone metastases and soft tissue masses with electroporation-based therapies is relatively recent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 21\\]</u>, good outcomes have been recorded in terms of pain control and tumor necrosis. A phase II clinical study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> conducted on 29 patients affected by painful bone metastatic disease showed an improvement on pain control or a decrease in analgesic consumption in 84% of the cases, while a local progression was detected in around 7% of the patients. No patient suffered from intolerance to bleomycin; local complications were rare accounting for skin ulceration and necrosis in previously irradiated skin and a neurogenic bladder after the third treatment in a large lesion involving the sacrum. Overall, electrochemotherapy is safe and feasible in well-selected patients with multimetastatic bone disease and provides good results on pain control and local disease progression. It also allows treating tumor masses and nodules in the proximity of noble structures such as vessels and nerves as the treatment does not employ tissue heating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Electrochemotherapy is currently in use at the referral centers for musculoskeletal surgery in Italy, while the Italian Society of Orthopedics and Traumatology (SIOT) has included it in the guidelines for the management of unresectable sacral tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Also, a registry named ReinBONE (Registry on Electrochemotherapy in Bone), which is promoted by the Study Group for Bone Metastasis of the SIOT, is at present collecting clinical data on the treated cases. The photodynamic bone stabilization system is a recent, minimally invasive surgical technique that allows surgeons to repair bone fractures using alight-curable polymer contained within an inflatable balloon catheter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. This technique allows the time to obtain a proper reduction of the fracture before hardening the polymer, unlike polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement: once correct alignment, rotational stability, and bone length have been restored, the visible light curing system is introduced to rapidly polymerize the liquid in the balloon to form a durable, hardened stabilizing rod. The ability of the system to get into contact with the cortical bone, filling the medullary space, significantly reduces the rotatory instability of the traditional intramedullary devices that require the use of further hardware, such as screws, to provide stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>. Also, if necessary, the hardened polymer can be used as a substrate for supplemental osteosynthesis as screws can be inserted as in conventional nails, to provide supplemental stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. A preliminary study reported no complications in the treatment of 36 osteoporotic and metastatic fractures of non-weight-bearing bones apart from one surgical revision of a humeral fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. To validate the initial studies, a European Union Registry has been set up: the first results reported achievement of procedural success, and no removal or revision of implants was required in 149 fractures treated with the polymeric rod 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Recently, a prospective study on 33 patients with traumatic humeral fractures treated with the polymeric rod showed a complete healing in the whole sample of patients, with good pain control and satisfying functional outcomes. The procedure’s complication rate was around 35% which is not higher than what was reported in literature for other stabilization systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. A comparison study among cemental plate fixation, intramedullary nailing, and photodynamic stabilization in the treatment of 105 malignant pathologic humeral fractures was conducted. No significant differences were registered in reoperation rates, but the rate of broken implants was significantly higher in patients treated with a polymeric rod 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Although the photodynamic polymer stabilization system is usually indicated for metastatic and osteoporotic fractures of non-weight-bearing bones fractures, several other uses are reported in the literature such as compassionate stabilization of femoral fractures in nonambulant patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> and surgical augmentation of acetabular and femoral fractures in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28, 29\\]</u>. Also, a preliminary study on sheep provided encouraging results in the treatment of weight-bearing bone fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. The system is contraindicated in active or not completely healed infections, even if studies have been carried out on the antimicrobial effect of the light used for the polymerization of the system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.\n\n【13】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【14】The management of a patient with a multimetastatic bone disease benefits a multidisciplinary approach. Whenever medical or radiation therapy is neither effective nor indicated, several palliative surgeries can be proposed to the patient.

Introduction\n\n【3】Painful thyroid has a limited differential diagnosis. In addition to trauma and nodular hemorrhages, subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain thyroiditis, is the most common cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Subacute thyroiditis is a mostly bilateral inflammatory disorder causing a slightly swollen, tender thyroid gland, frequently accompanied by thyrotoxicosis. Markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein levels are hallmarks of this disorder. A viral cause has been proposed, as it is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. The condition is self-limiting and symptomatic treatment with analgetics usually suffices. Sometimes corticosteroids are needed. Rare causes of a painful thyroid gland are infection, radiation induced-thyroiditis, malignancy, and neuralgia of the superior laryngeal nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In case of infection, surgical therapy can be indicated when antibiotic therapy is inadequate or drainage of an abscess is necessary. Nodular hemorrhages and radiation-induced thyroiditis are usually self-limiting conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Neuralgia of the superior laryngeal nerve is a complex pain disorder and may require high-dose analgetics and peripheral blockade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In rare cases, no clear cause for a painful thyroid gland can be found after careful clinical, biochemical, and radiological analysis. This may lead to extensive patient morbidity and frustration when symptomatic treatment proves insufficient. Hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy may then be the last resort for doctor and patient. Three cases of unexplained painful thyroid that were successfully treated with surgical therapy are presented, and the differential diagnosis is discussed.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case 1\n\n【6】A 41-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of a cesarean section and a diagnostic laparoscopy presented with an extremely painful right thyroid gland since four months. Some weeks before the onset of the pain she suffered from an upper respiratory tract infection. There was no fever. The pain was constant and increased on swallowing. The patient was initially treated by the family physician. Analgetics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and morphinomimetics did not decrease the pain. On physical examination the right thyroid lobe was not enlarged but extremely painful on palpation. There were no obvious thyroid nodes. The left thyroid lobe was normal. There were no enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. Laboratory tests showed euthyroidism: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 0.59 mU/L (normal value 0.4–4.4 mU/L), free thyroxine (T4) level was 19.4 pmol/L (normal value 10–24 pmol/L), and triiodothyronine (T3) level was 1.7 nmol/L (normal value 1.3–2.6 nmol/L). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody level was low (<10 ku/L). Leukocyte count (6,400/mm<sup>3</sup>), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (11 mm/h), and C-reactive protein level (7 mg/dL) were within normal limits. Ultrasonography showed multiple nodes in the right thyroid lobe with a maximum diameter of 12 mm without any signs of haemorrhage or abscess. The dental surgeon and otolaryngologist excluded referred pain from dental or nasopharyngeal pathology. The patient was treated with analgetics and subsequently corticosteroids for several weeks based on the presumed diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. However, this did not resolve the symptoms. The pain was increasingly invalidating and led to absence of work. Finally, 6 months after onset of symptoms, a right hemithyroidectomy was performed. The specimen measured 5 × 3 × 3  cm. Histological study revealed diffuse hyperplasia with prominent uncomplicated hyperplastic nodes and some mild lymphocytic thyroiditis . Immediately after surgery the pain had disappeared completely. Up to one year following surgery the patient was free of pain and had a normal thyroid function.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Diffuse hyperplasia with prominent uncomplicated hyperplastic nodes and some lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hematoxylin-eosin, ×200). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Case 2\n\n【9】A 41-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of laparoscopic gastric banding for morbid obesity and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy presented with an extremely painful right thyroid lobe. Since several months she had experienced palpitations and heat intolerance, and since three weeks extreme pain had developed in the right thyroid lobe during a period of fever and malaise. She had not noticed any enlargement of the thyroid gland. There had been no weight loss or other physical changes. Analgesic therapy did not relieve the symptoms. On physical examination there were no signs of thyrotoxicosis. There was a slightly enlarged left thyroid lobe without any palpable nodes and a palpable node of approximately 2 cm in the right lobe, which was very painful on examination. There were no enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. Laboratory tests revealed thyrotoxicosis: TSH level was 0.02 mU/L (normal value 0.4–4.4 mU/L) and free thyroxine (T4) level 60.7 pmol/L (normal value 10–24 pmol/L). There were no detectable thyroid-stimulating antibodies or TPO antibodies. There was no leukocytosis (4,400/mm<sup>3</sup>), erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 29 mm/h, and there was a slight increase in C-reactive protein (23 mg/dL). A Tc-99M scan showed a slightly enlarged thyroid with normal 24-hour uptake, and a cold node on the right side of 4 cm, as well as a node on the left side (3 cm) with normal uptake. Fine-needle aspiration yielded no conclusive diagnosis. The otolaryngologist excluded any pharyngeal or tracheal pathology. The following causes were considered in the differential diagnosis: subacute thyroiditis of de Quervain or an early hyperthyroid phase of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis). The thyroid function returned to normal within two months without any antithyroid therapy. However, the right hemithyroid remained extremely painful. The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and morphinomimetics for several weeks without any improvement of symptoms. Finally, four months after onset of pain, a right hemithyroidectomy was performed. The specimen measured 4 × 4 × 2  cm. Histological study showed some nodular hyperplasia with degenerative changes, a limited lymphocytic thyroiditis, and a focal area with sclerosis. Elsewhere, bleeding and signs of previous bleeding were seen. Remarkable was the presence of adipose metaplasia of thyroid stroma . Immediately after surgery the pain had disappeared completely. Up to several months after surgery, the patient was free of pain and had a normal thyroid function.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Nodular hyperplasia with degenerative changes, a limited lymphocytic thyroiditis and adipose metaplasia of thyroid stroma.

Case 3\n\n【12】A 17-year-old Caucasian woman with no prior medical history presented with an extremely painful thyroid. She had noticed gradual enlargement of the thyroid gland since five years, but more rapid growth during the last six months, accompanied by pain on the right side. Moreover, she had difficulty swallowing because of pain, resulting in decreased food intake and 10 kg weight loss during the last six months. In addition, she complained of a coarse voice since several months. There was no fever. Analgetic therapy did not relieve the symptoms. On physical examination there were no signs of hypo- or hyperthyroid function. There was a WHO grade II goiter without palpable nodules which was extremely painful on examination. There were no enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and there were no signs of respiratory distress. Laboratory tests showed biochemical euthyroidism: TSH level was 3.77 mU/L (normal value 0.4–4.4 mU/L), free thyroxine (T4) level was 13.4 pmol/L (normal value 10–24 pmol/L), and triiodothyronine (T3) level was 2.1 nmol/L (normal value 1.3–2.6 nmol/L). TPO antibody level was increased (459 ku/L). There was no increased leukocyte count (3,400/mm<sup>3</sup>) or increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (5 mm/h). An I-123 scan showed a homogenously enlarged thyroid (slightly more increased on the right side) with a 24-hour uptake of 42%. The otolaryngologist excluded any pharyngeal or tracheal pathology. Esophagogastroscopy revealed no pathology explaining difficulty swallowing or weight loss. Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid revealed lymphocytic thyroiditis, in accordance with the diagnosis of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids for several months without any improvement of symptoms. Finally, eight months following onset of pain, a total thyroidectomy was conducted. Histological study indeed showed a very severe lymphocytic thyroiditis with formation of lymphatic follicles . Immediately after surgery the pain had disappeared completely. Up to several years following surgery the patient was free of pain.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Severe lymphocytic infiltration with formation of lymphatic follicles and Hürthle cells (Hematoxylin-eosin, ×100). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【14】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【15】This case series describes three patients with extreme, invalidating pain located within the thyroid gland, which could not adequately be managed by symptomatic treatment. The complaints resolved completely and immediately upon surgical removal of the painful thyroid tissue.\n\n【16】The clinical presentation in the first case is reminiscent of subacute thyroiditis which is sometimes preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection. However, unilateral pain, normal levels of C-reactive protein, and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate are not in agreement with this diagnosis. Moreover, subacute thyroiditis is often characterized by thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism. The symptoms usually improve dramatically following the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Finally, the histological specimens did not show the typical changes expected in subacute thyroiditis nor yielded any other cause for the patient’s complaints.\n\n【17】In the second case, the differential diagnosis included early hyperthyroid phase of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) and subacute thyroiditis. Unilateral pain, however, is not typical for either condition. The absence of thyroid antibodies would support subacute thyroiditis. However, a normal 24-hour I-123 uptake or Tc-99M scan and the only slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels are more in favour of HT. We could not document histological changes confirming HT nor subacute thyroiditis.\n\n【18】Histological evaluation of the thyroid gland of the third case clearly identified HT. This autoimmune disease is characterized by painless goiter, and hypothyroidism is sometimes preceded by a hyperthyroid phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. TPO antibodies are usually elevated, but they may be low or even absent in HT. Rarely, it may present as a painful goiter and sometimes clinically resembles subacute thyroiditis. Although painful HT often presents with fever, transient thyrotoxicosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, patients may also be euthyroid or hypothyroid, and infection parameters may be normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The diagnosis of HT in the case of an extremely painful thyroid is therefore typically based on histological studies. Although painful HT has been previously described, the literature is limited to case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–12\\]</u>. Initial treatment for painful HT is typically symptomatic with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids or may be focused on hormone replacement therapy. Quite often this might not be sufficient. In these cases surgical treatment has proven a successful option, in accordance with our observation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>. Clinical features and pain relief following surgery of all patients presented in the literature that were surgically treated for painful HT are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n【19】Table 1 Characteristics of fifteen patients with painful Hashimoto’s thyroiditis who underwent thyroidectomy.\n\n【20】Table 2 Pain relief to treatment and surgical pathology in fifteen cases of painful Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.\n\n【21】Speculation on the cause of pain in the first two cases includes atypical viral infection since both patients had experienced a prodromal period of fever and malaise. Another speculation is that even uncomplicated thyroid nodes might cause severe pain in exceptional cases.\n\n【22】The differential diagnosis of unilateral thyroid pain includes superior laryngeal neuralgia, a complex pain disorder which is thought to represent a “referred pain” from the pharyngeal and laryngeal regions. A viral infection has also been proposed. A substrate for superior laryngeal neuralgia is seldom found. The pain is typically located between the thyroid and the ear and is described as paroxysmal and “electrical”. There is usually a trigger point, and episodes may be accompanied by nausea or excessive lacrimation. Treatment is symptomatic and may require high-dose analgetics and peripheral blockade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 5\\]</u>. However, none of the above-mentioned clinical presentations resembled superior laryngeal neuralgia.\n\n【23】In conclusion, we describe three patients with extreme invalidating pain which severely interfered with daily activities and work. In all cases symptomatic treatment was not successful. The pain was immediately relieved by hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy. Remarkably, extensive histological evaluation did not yield a satisfactory explanation for the extreme thyroid pain in two cases, and in one case, HT was found. This indicates that surgical therapy is a successful final option in the treatment of unexplained painful thyroid and painful HT.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Here, we describe the case of a patient with acute myocardial infarction due to stent thrombosis of a sirolimus-eluting stent 42 months after stent deployment and 5 weeks after discontinuation of aspirin treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most delayed cases of sirolimus-eluting stent thrombosis described so far.

Introduction\n\n【3】Stent thrombosis following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is regarded as a complication of the procedure mainly occurring during the first 30 postprocedural days.

Premature discontinuation of antiplatelet treatment was identified as the most important independent predictor of stent thrombosis after successful DES implantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 72-year-old man with a known history of coronary artery disease (CAD) was admitted to our cardiology department in September 2006 with symptoms of acute and ongoing chest pain at rest. 42 months before this admission, in March 2003, coronary angiography showed a two-vessel coronary disease with two significant lesions of the left circumflex (LCx) artery. One sirolimus-eluting stent (Cypher, 3 mm diameter, 13 mm long; Cordis, Miami Lakes, Fla, USA) was placed in the 1st left posterolateral branch and a second bare-metal stent (BeStent, 2.5 mm diameter, 12 mm long, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn, USA) was implanted in the 2nd left posterolateral branch of the LCx. The patient was discharged on dual antithrombotic medication consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel. In September 2003, 6 months after PCI, coronary angiography demonstrated both a patent bare-metal and sirolimus-eluting stents. Clopidogrel was discontinued another 6 months later. Henceforth, the patient was on monotherapy with aspirin 200 mg/d. The following three years were uneventful regarding his CAD. At the end of July 2006, 5 weeks before his present admission, aspirin was discontinued due to planned dental surgery and planned coloscopy with a potential demand for polypectomy. On his present admission, emergency coronary angiography was performed due to ongoing chest pain, a positive troponin T (0.21 ng/mL) and an elevated level (350 IU/L) of creatine kinase (CK). Angiography showed total occlusion of the 1st left posterolateral branch, an ostial stenosis of the 2nd left posterolateral branch (proximal to the bare-metal stent) and a patent bare-metal BeStent 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Further on, angiography demonstrated stent occlusion of sirolimus-eluting stent and extensive thrombus after guidewire passage 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>.

Discussion\n\n【8】To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most delayed cases of sirolimus-eluting stent thrombosis described so far. Late-stent thrombosis, 42 months after deployment, was probably due to aspirin withdrawal accompanied by a lack of endothelialization of the stent struts.

The case emphasizes the potential risk that late stent thrombosis can unpredictably occur at any time point after drug-eluting stent deployment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Stent thrombosis must be considered as a potential risk when discontinuation of antiplatelet medication is contemplated and any decision to stop antiplatelet therapy for whatever reason in patients exhibiting drug-eluting stents should take this into account.

Traumatic and iatrogenic disruption of the limited blood flow to the distal end of the humerus resulting in avascular necrosis of capitellum or trochlea is a major pitfall of the this technically challenging procedure. Two cases are presented which illustrate the potential problems of intra-articular osteotomy for malunion of the distal humerus.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Distal humerus fractures are uncommon, accounting for only 2 percent of all fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Open reduction and internal fixation to restore articular anatomy and allow early motion to prevent stiffness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> is the preferred treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Despite rapid improvements in operative management, fractures of the distal end of the humerus are still among the most difficult fractures to treat. Complex articular anatomy with little cancellous bone support makes operative fixation challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although challenging, in young active patients early fixation is recommended, despite the complexity of the fracture. An unsatisfactory outcome is common for this patient population when minimal treatment is used to treat the initial fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In the rare case of malunion, intra-articular or supracondylar osteotomy to restore humeral alignment and provide a more useful arc of motion is legitimate. In the case of an extra-articular osteotomy to correct flexion or extension alignment, treatment can be indicated despite the presence of posttraumatic arthrosis of an incongruent elbow joint. However, intra-articular osteotomy treatment is only considered when the patient is seen early and secondary post-traumatic arthritis is at an early stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Intra-articular corrective osteotomy for malunited fractures of the distal humerus is technically demanding and the literature on this subject scarce 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>.

Case Report\n\n【7】Our patient was a 48-year-old dentist who was seen 10 months after a high energy fall that resulted in a complex type C3 intra-articular fracture of her left nondominant distal humerus 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Initial treatment performed at an outside institution consisted of static external fixation with the arm in flexion and the forearm in neutral rotation 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. The external fixator was removed after 8 weeks and the follow-up radiographs revealed delayed union which resulted in intra-articular malunion of the distal humerus. The patient was referred to the senior author (RKM) with substantial overlength of the capitellum resulting in 25 degrees cubitus varus deformity. Flexion extension arc was 95 degrees with a 35-degree flexion contracture. Her forearm rotation was normal. She did not have pain and did not opt for surgery at this point. Four months later, she reported substantial pain and lost all her active motion. The patient opted for surgery mainly to regain extension in order to return to work. Neurological examination was unremarkable. She had no signs of ulnar neuropathy.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Our patient was a 48-year-old dentist who was seen 10 months after a high energy fall that resulted in a complex intra-articular fracture of her left nondominant distal humerus.

A midline posterior incision, with medial and lateral skin flaps elevated, was used. The olecranon osteotomy provided a complete overview of the dorsal distal humerus, including the radiohumeral joint and the ulnar nerve. An oscillating saw was used to create a trapezoid wedge to correct overlength varus of the lateral column and flexion of the capitellum in order to realign capitellum and trochlea. Extreme caution was taken no to disrupt the anterior blood supply of the capitellum. A second supracondylar wedge was resected to correct cubitus varus and 20 degrees of internal rotation. The capitellum radii was fixed to the ulnar condyle using an isolated lag screw 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. Iliac crest bone graft was used to improve bone healing and fixation was achieved with a lateral 7hour-LCDC plate and screws. The olecranon osteotomy was fixed with screw-tension band technique 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(d))</u>. Intraoperative ulnohumeral motion was 90 degrees of flexion with full extension after debridement of the olecranon fossa. The elbow was placed in a cast in full extension for 24 hours.\n\n【10】She had loss of anterior translation of the distal end of the humerus resulting in 90 degrees of flexion and 5 degrees of hyperextension of the left elbow 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(e))</u>. The patient was satisfied initially with her stable function elbow and 95 degrees of ulnohumeral motion. However, 18 months postoperatively she decided to have removal of hardware and an extra-articular excavation of the prominent ventral distal humerus creating a new fossa coronoidea in order to gain flexion. Her final flexion improved to 110 degrees with 5 degrees of hyperextension 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(f))</u>. She had a functional outcome, quantified as 95 points by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Elbow Evaluation Instrument and the Mayo Elbow Performance Index. Continuous passive motion was initiated 24 hours after surgery and therapy was started.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to specifically address intra-articular osteotomy to treat distal humerus malunion. However, small series have been published as part of surgical technique and clinical outcome papers on intra- and extra-articualar malunion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. McKee and Jupiter reported on two malunited fractures of the distal humerus that underwent intra-articular osteotomy in a series of distal humerus malunion and nonunion with good results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The cornerstone of treatment of fractures of the distal humerus is operative reduction and internal fixation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–13\\]</u>. Pessimism regarding these fractures is not justified with contemporary methods of internal fixation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However, routine in treatment does not exist due to the rarity of these fractures. In addition, the complex articular surface and meager amount of cancellous bone still makes operative treatment a substantial challenge.\n\n【14】Nonunion and malunion of distal humerus fractures treated operatively is rare. Only 2% of all fractures involve the distal humerus, and 2% of these result in malunion. Intra-articular osteotomy for malunion to achieve a functional arc of motion and to prevent subsequent posttraumatic arthritis in the elbow joint is rarely indicated in the young demanding patient. Therefore, experience with treatment of intra-articular malunited fractures is very limited and reports seldom appear in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>. We feel that total elbow arthroplasty for malunion of the distal humerus is a treatment option reserved for low-demand elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【15】If the patient present at an early stage, an intra-articular osteotomy is considered if original fracture lines can be osteotomized and posttraumatic arthrosis is limited. Extra-articular osteotomy is indicated when intra-articular congruency of the elbow joint cannot be restored and secondary posttraumatic arthrosis is too advanced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. Preoperative planning is paramount to assess if it is technically feasible to restore ulnohumeral congruency 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>.\n\n【16】Stability of the elbow joint and a functional arc of motion were achieved in this case. After intra-articular osteotomy, the patient had only 90 degrees of flexion due to loss of anterior translation of the distal humerus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Initial loss of flexion was accepted by patient and surgeon to avoid devascularization of the distal end of the humerus. After avoiding too much dissection during the index procedure in case one, the patient opted for a successful subsequent procedure to gain flexion. Satisfactory functional outcome was quantified by the Mayo Elbow Performance Index and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Instrument.\n\n【17】Surgical reconstruction of the intra-articular malunited distal humerus is technically challenging but can improve function in the young active adult by restoring intrinsic anatomy of the elbow.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The patient was negative for both acid-alcohol resistant bacillus and human immunodeficiency virus.\n\n【6】An abdominal X-ray showed a soft-tissue mass with no calcification, on the right flank and mesogastrium, with inferior deviation of the bowel . Based on these findings, an ultrasonography (US) exam was performed, showing a hypoechoic stenosing mass of about 7.7 centimeters at the greatest diameter, in the right colon.

Discussion\n\n【12】Colon adenocarcinoma is a rare tumor in pediatric patients, with an incidence of one in one million 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. This causes a low index of suspicion in physicians. Pediatric colon adenocarcinoma is associated with poorly differentiated histological type, and neoplasms are usually at an advanced stage at presentation, with liver and lymph node metastasis and in some cases, peritoneal carcinomatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–5\\]</u>. In this case, residual disease remained after surgery, with macroscopic lymph node involvement.\n\n【13】Histologically, mucinous adenocarcinoma is the most common histotype in pediatric colon cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–5\\]</u>. The literature is not clear about the tumor distribution in the colon; however, the disease does not appear to have a predisposition for any particular portion of the colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. In this case, the lesion was in the right colon. The clinical features are similar to adults, with abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, weight loss, rectal bleeding, abdominal palpable mass, and anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–6\\]</u>. Our patient also presented with dizziness, weakness, dyspnea and anorexia, but no bleeding. Although mucinous adenocarcinoma can be a complication of familial polyposis of the colon and ulcerative colitis, most cases occur in children with no predisposing factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. According to published reports, the lag time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis is usually 3 to 6 months and in general, patients present with several symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Barium enema studies suggest that colon carcinomas in adults are generally small polypoid masses (early carcinoma), irregular annular lesions with abrupt margins, or large intraluminal masses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. By US abdomen examination, bowel wall thickening from colorectal carcinoma may result in a target or pseudokidney configuration, in which the central echogenic mucosa is surrounded by an abnormally thick hypoechoic rim 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Carcinoma should be suspected if a CT scan shows a discrete mass or focal thickening of the colonic wall. In advanced stages, a large soft-tissue mass containing calcification might be found, causing bowel obstruction. Evident wall thickening, enlarged lymph nodes, surrounding organs or mesenteric fat invasion, hydronephrosis, liver metastasis (seen as focal calcifications), and peritoneal effusion may also be noted. Other complications including perforation, abscess, and fistulas may also be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9–11\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In this case, disease was at advanced stage at diagnosis, with CT and US exams showing a large mass in the right colon wall, causing significant reduction and irregularity of the lumen, and infiltrating the mesenterium and adjacent abdominal wall, consistent with the literature. Enlarged lymph nodes were also identified.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【17】Prognosis in colorectal cancer is usually determined by the degree of intestinal wall invasion, lymph node involvement, and hematogenous metastases. For this reason, early detection increases the chance of cure. Therefore, the rarity, low level of suspicion, and aggressive histological type normally seen in children can lead, in most cases, to late diagnosis and poor prognosis.\n\n【18】In our case, imaging revealed extensive metastatic disease, disseminated throughout the peritoneal cavity, reflecting the delay in diagnosis that is described in the literature in similar cases. These findings were confirmed during surgery, which determined the impossibility of curative resection, and led to a poor prognosis, despite adjuvant therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Abdominal pregnancy is a rare condition in which early termination is generally recommended. However, there are cases of abdominal pregnancies treated using expectant management with satisfactory outcomes. This management may be considered in special cases, such as previously infertile couples. Case. A case of a 27-year-old woman with infertility history complaining of vaginal bleeding was presented. Physical and ultrasound examination revealed an abdominal pregnancy with 18 weeks of gestation. Although she was ready to abort the pregnancy, she insisted to try expectant management for her pregnancy. Her baby was finally born at 25 weeks via laparotomy. Conclusion. Abdominal pregnancy is a rare and highly morbid form of ectopic pregnancy. It demands a skilled approach in management. A comprehensive and holistic approach is required to deliver the best outcome for the patient and her family.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Infertility is a common clinical problem affecting 10–15% of all couples worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Infertility is not only a medical problem but also is considered a social problem. There are many impacts of infertility on a couple and their environment. The feeling of depression, grief, guilt, and shame may become an additional problem, along with social isolation experienced by those suffering from infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Abdominal pregnancy is a form of ectopic pregnancy of which the sites of implantation included Douglas pouch, omentum, pelvic sidewall, bowel, liver, diaphragm, and large pelvic vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The abdominal pregnancy rate ranges between 1 : 10,000 and 1 : 30,000 in the population, representing 1% of all extrauterine pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Main risk factors for abdominal pregnancy include tubal damage, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, assisted reproduction techniques, and multiparity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Abdominal pregnancy is rather difficult to be distinguished from a tubal pregnancy or even a normal pregnancy. Early surgical termination is generally recommended to avoid further maternal risks. However, there are also cases of live birth following conservative management of abdominal pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is deemed as highly morbid and usually reserved for special populations, one of which is couples with the history of infertility.\n\n【6】This study aimed to present a case of a biopsychosocial approach for conservative management of abdominal pregnancy in previously infertile couple.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【8】A 27-year-old G1 woman with 18<sup>th</sup> weeks of gestation came to our obstetrics and gynecology policlinic with chief complaint of abnormal vaginal discharge since a day prior. There was no complaint of vaginal bleeding, urinary problem, nor defecation problem. Previously, she had her routine antenatal care at an obstetrician located in another city. Previously, she thought she had normal pregnancy. However, it was known that her pregnancy was an abdominal pregnancy since 3 weeks ago (15<sup>th</sup> weeks of gestation). Afterward, she was referred to other hospital in our city. She then routinely took her antenatal examination every 2 weeks.\n\n【9】Previously, her husband and she were suffering from 3 years of primary infertility. She had never used any kind of contraceptive. Her prior medical condition and her family history were also unremarkable.\n\n【10】The patient’s vital sign was stable at the time of arrival. Physical examination revealed her fundal height matched the gestational age. Her fetal heart rate was 145 times per minute, while her vaginal discharge was identified as flour albus, suspected to be caused by bacterial vaginosis. Her laboratory results revealed mild microcytic hypochromic anemia and mild hypokalemia.\n\n【11】Ultrasonographic examination revealed singleton abdominal pregnancy with normal biometry and normal activity. The gestational sac was located in the pouch of Douglas, while the placenta was implanted at the omentum. There was no congenital anomaly identified on the fetus .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Ultrasonographic image of the abdominal pregnancy.</u>\n\n【13】A family meeting consisting of the patient, her husband, and the obstetricians was commenced following the examination. She was told that abdominal pregnancy was a highly morbid form of ectopic pregnancy; thus, there were significant risks associated with it. However, she was also told that there might be hope for satisfactory maternal and fetal outcomes. She told the obstetricians that her husband and she were suffering badly due to her previous infertility. They also experienced being gossiped by their families and neighbors. Therefore, she hoped that she can retain her pregnancy as they were unsure if she could have any other pregnancy. Eventually, the meeting ended with agreement of trying expectant approach for the pregnancy.\n\n【14】She was a housewife, while her husband was a merchant at a traditional market. Although they are suffering from their previous infertility, they could not afford to seek out medical help due to financial problem. Moreover, there was no sufficient medical infrastructure to address their problem in their city. On the third day following the meeting, there was no complaint remained. She was then discharged and planned to have antenatal care every 2 weeks at our center.\n\n【15】She had her antenatal care on our center. There was no sign of complication on the examination. Ultrasonographic exam showed estimated fetal weight of 297 g and placenta was implanted to omentum. It corresponded to 19 weeks of gestational age. During US Doppler examination, there was a absent end diastolic in the umbilical artery. Based on the data, additional heparin was initiated.\n\n【16】During her 25<sup>th</sup> gestational week, reverse A wave ductus venosus with brain sparing effect and reverse end diastolic umbilical artery was found. It was decided to deliver the fetus via laparotomy. Due to placenta implantation on the mesenteries, the laparotomy was done with assistance of digestive surgeons.\n\n【17】During the surgery, abdominal gestational sac was seen, covered by the right broad ligament, behind the uterus, filling the Douglas cavity. The uterus was slightly enlarged in front of the abdominal gestational sac. After delivering the baby, the placenta was seen to be implanted on the lateral side of the posterior uterine. Thus, placenta was left in site in order to prevent massive hemorrhage. The abdomen was then closed .\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Abdominal gestational sac. (b) The placenta. (c) Delivering the baby. (d) The placenta left in site.</u>\n\n【19】The baby was sent to neonatal intensive care unit for further evaluation and treatment. Meanwhile, the mother was observed for 24 hours at intensive care unit and discharged two days following the surgery. Two days later, the baby died due to respiratory distress.\n\n【20】A year after the surgery, the mother was alive and well. Upon follow-up examination, the placenta left was already reduced in size, while the mother had started another pregnancy program.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】##### 3.1. Biological Aspect\n\n【23】Infertility is a common problem affecting up to 15% of all couples worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It was categorized into primary (for those not having children prior to the infertility) and secondary infertility. It was associated with several medical problems arising from both the men and women. According to previous study, the most common causes of infertility are sperm abnormalities, ovulation dysfunction, and tubal pathology. However, a few of the cases remain unexplained 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our case, the patient and her husband experienced primary infertility, which pushed them to try to retain the abdominal pregnancy as they were unsure if the patient could have any other pregnancy.\n\n【24】Abdominal pregnancy is a rare event but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The incidence varies widely with geographical location, degree of antenatal attendance, level of medical care, and socioeconomic status. It is believed that abdominal pregnancy is more common in developing countries, probably because of the high frequency of pelvic inflammatory disease in these areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Besides, it may be due to low socioeconomic status, history of infertility, tubal sterilization, tubal reconstruction surgery, and pregnancy with intrauterine device 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Abdominal pregnancy is also associated with maternal mortality rate of 0.5–18% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The maternal mortality rate was 7.7 times higher than that observed in tubal ectopic pregnancies and 90 times higher than in an intrauterine pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Several studies considered that expectant management is possible, while others proposed that there is a high risk for a life-threatening hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Therefore, early surgical termination is advised to all abdominal pregnancy patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, there were cases of expectant management for abdominal pregnancies with satisfactory results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 10\\]</u>. Although there were cases of successful expectant management for abdominal pregnancies, it is usually reserved for special populations, one of which is previously infertile couples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Our patient in this case also experienced primary infertility prior to this pregnancy. However, the neonate died shortly after birth in this study. Therefore, we recommend that abdominal pregnancy be diagnosed and preferably terminated early to prevent further complications.\n\n【26】##### 3.2. Psychologic Aspect\n\n【27】Infertility has devastating consequences to a couple psychology. Due to infertility involving an inability to achieve the desired social role as “parents,” infertility is associated with severe psychological distress for a couple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. This problem creates stress for the couple, increasing the risk of developing anger, depression, anxiety, and various marital problems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Ironically, the psychological problems associated with infertility often increase sexual dysfunction and social isolation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Along with the stress associated with the infertility itself, there is considerable stress associated with those undertaking in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other forms of infertility treatment. A previous study mentioned that the clinical depression rates of women trying to conceive using IVF are similar to those having heart disease or even cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Therefore, psychologic assessment and guidance should be delivered to all infertile patients.\n\n【29】Abdominal pregnancy in our case also added additional psychologic burden to our patient and her husband. After three years of waiting, they had to accept the fact that their baby might not survive and the patient had to shoulder the additional risks associated with abdominal pregnancy.\n\n【30】##### 3.3. Social Aspect\n\n【31】Infertility remains as a social problem worldwide. Due to the traditions of some countries, infertility is associated with a social stigma of being “imperfect,” especially for the women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It is caused by patriarchy developed in many countries. Although recent medical advances have shown that there are as many cases of which male factor is the main factor of infertility, the societies continue to blame women as the “perpetrator” of infertility. Moreover, this phenomenon is often accompanied with the normalization of polygamy practice due to infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【32】There are many patients not receiving the recommended medical care according to several guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The suboptimal management may be caused by several factors, namely, the reluctance of the patients, the cost of infertility treatment, and the availability of proper medical infrastructure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In our case, the patient and her husband had not taken any steps to address their infertility problem due to the high cost and unavailability of proper medical infrastructure in their city. Moreover, her husband worked as a merchant at a traditional market, thus accompanying her wife to other city meant no income for their family.\n\n【33】On the other hand, in abdominal pregnancy, we try to joint with the stockholder in their around home to help if there is any emergency situation and ready to bring her to the RSCM Hospital.\n\n【34】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【35】Abdominal pregnancy is a rare and highly morbid form of ectopic pregnancy. It demands skilled approach in management. Early diagnosis and termination are preferable to ensure the best outcome for the mother. Comprehensive and holistic approach is required in order to deliver the best outcome for the patient and her family.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The histologic examination of the resected mass showed follicular pattern with large nodules of mantle cells arranged concentrically around atrophic and vascularized germinal centers.

Discussion\n\n【17】CD is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–6\\]</u>. It is variously named as angiofollicular hyperplasia, giant lymph node hyperplasia, angiomatous lymphoid hyperplasia, localized nodal hyperplasia, and lymphoid hamartoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>. CD has a wide age distribution ranging from adolescence to seven decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【18】In 1972 Keller et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> divided CD in three histologic types: hyaline vascular type (75–90%), plasma cell type (10–25%), and mixed type (1–4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. The hyaline-vascular type is characterized by small-to medium-sized follicles that contain small blood vessels that penetrate atrophic germinal centers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. The mantle zone lymphocytes arrange in concentric layering at the periphery of follicles resulting in an onion-skin appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The interfollicular stroma is also vascular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. While plasma cell type is characterized by proliferation of plasma cells in interfollicular tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【19】According to clinical presentation CD may be unicentric or multicentric 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–6, 9, 10\\]</u>. The unicentric form is usually of hyaline-vascular type, pauci symptomatic with favorable prognosis and commonly involves the mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Most cases of multicentric CD are of plasma cell type, associated with anemia, fever, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4, 9\\]</u>. Another rare new histologic variant of multicentric CD is plasmablastic type which runs an aggressive course with higher incidence of progression to lymphoma or Kaposi sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The etiology of CD is unclear. There is a strong evidence of HHV-8 participation in development of multicentric CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. It is hypothesized that HHV-8 via production of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is responsible for lymphoplasmacytic and vascular proliferation, and use of blocking antibody against IL-6 receptor may result in symptom resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【21】In our case osseous metaplasia was observed in a lymph node involved by hyaline-vascular type of CD. Among hematologic malignancies, amyloid-producing dyscrasia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were reported to produce heterotopic bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Two theories for this phenomenon are proposed: (i) tumor cells directly differentiate into osteoblasts, (ii) tumor cells secrete substances which induce osteoblastic differentiation in adjacent mesenchymal cells. One of these suggested substances that induce osseous metaplasia in epithelial tumors is bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. BMPs are members of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) which stimulates differentiation of mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts through binding to appropriate receptor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Bull et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> demonstrated that HHV-8 will downregulate BMP-4 (an osteogenic factor), so osseous metaplasia in CD may be produced by other substances. IL-6 is may be the responsible factor. Although this interleukin is considered as a bone resorption factor, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u> it may play a role in bone formation and osteoblast proliferation, too 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 13\\]</u>. Also amyloid deposit may be seen in CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, and this could be site for osseous metaplasia, but no amyloid deposit was seen in our case.\n\n【22】The differential diagnosis of CD is non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (follicular, mantle cell, and marginal zone B cell lymphoma), Hodgkin’s lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and a variety of reactive lymphadenopathies such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren, HIV, and drug sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Unicentric CD is cured by surgical resection, but the course of multicentric CD is chronic, requiring continuous therapy and it may progress to malignant lesions such as lymphoma, plasma cell dyscrasia, or Kapos’ i sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【23】#### 4\\.

Maluf and Koerner first reported this disease entity as a special type of ductal carcinoma in situ with several characteristic histopathological features, including low-grade cellular atypia, intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition, and solid papillary growth pattern, as well as neuroendocrine differentiation. The present paper describes a case of SPC with bcl-2 expression, which is known as a marker for malignancy of neuroendocrine tumors. Interestingly, despite bcl-2 expression being a poor prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors, the patient with this tumor has achieved long-term survival (approximately 6 years) at the time of writing this report. Because previous investigators reported that bcl-2 expression might play a role in the inhibition of the development of breast cancer, we suggest that bcl-2 expression might reflect a good prognosis in patients with SPC, rather than being a poor prognostic indicator, as it is in several types of neuroendocrine tumor. However, to confirm this hypothesis, further investigation is required.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Solid papillary carcinoma (SPC) is considered a rare malignant breast tumor, with an incidence ranging from 1.1% to 1.7% of all malignant breast tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–10\\]</u>.

Furthermore, the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) classification categorized this tumor as a solid papillary carcinoma (ICD-O codes: 8509/2 or 8509/3, with and without invasion) and indicated that solid neuroendocrine carcinoma originated from SPC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 62-year-old Japanese woman presenting with a mass in the left breast was admitted to Japanese hospital for evaluation of this lesion. Mammography showed a high-density mass, and breast ultrasonography showed well-demarcated, highly abundant blood flow and a cystic lesion . Because these results indicated the presence of a malignant tumor, fine-needle aspiration cytology and needle biopsy were performed. Aspiration cytology indicated a lesion suspicious for carcinoma . If tumor cells show ill-defined rosette formation, these findings indicate solid papillary carcinoma. But actually this is not 100% proven. We therefore conducted needle biopsy that suggested ductal carcinoma. Consequently, the patient underwent partial mastectomy of the left breast with lymph node dissection. Our patient’s surgical intervention had a successful outcome—neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis occurred, and she maintains a high quality of life 70 months after the operation.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 A breast ultrasonography image shows well-demarcated, highly abundant blood flow and a cystic lesion.

Discussion\n\n【15】Although SPC was first reported by Maluf and Koerner in 1995 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, this disease entity remains underrecognized by clinicians, cytotechnologists, and pathologists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. As previously mentioned, the 2010 WHO classification categorized this tumor as a solid papillary carcinoma. It is well known that SPC usually arises in the seventh or eighth decade and has a better prognosis than other breast cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Histopathologically, the tumor cells show a solid papillary growth pattern, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, and a round to elongated nucleus plus finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells usually show positive reactivity for neuroendocrine markers, including synaptophysin and chromogranin A. In addition, these tumors generally show positive reactivity for ER and PgR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Several types of low-grade ductal carcinomas should be considered as differential diagnoses for SPC. In particular, papillary carcinoma is similar to SPC in many respects. Namely, it arises in elderly patients, grows in large well-circumscribed ducts, and is characterized by a good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, this tumor differs from SPC by the presence of delicate papillae, a branching pattern, a cuboidal to columnar appearance of the tumor cells, and the lack of a solid growth pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 11\\]</u>. Certain benign intraductal tumors should be considered because of their solid or papillary intraductal epithelial growth pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 11\\]</u>. However, a uniform cell population, increased mitotic activity, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, and intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition are not usually seen in benign intraductal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 11\\]</u>. Furthermore, the importance of the confirmation of neuroendocrine differentiation has often been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In the present paper, the tumor cells followed the characteristic features of SPC, including a solid papillary growth pattern, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, a round to elongated and hyperchromatic nucleus, finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, and intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition, as well as positive reactivity for synaptophysin, but without positive reactivity for chromogranin A.\n\n【16】The immunohistochemical examination findings of this tumor are worthy further discussion. Ki-67 is known as a prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 17, 21, 22\\]</u>. Kawasaki et al. reported that the Ki-67 labeling index of nonneuroendocrine DCIS (8.1%) was significantly higher than that of neuroendocrine DCIS (4.3%), and they concluded that a low Ki-67 labeling index is correlated with a good prognosis in patients with neuroendocrine DCIS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In fact, our patient showed an exceptionally low Ki-67 labeling index (3.7%). In addition, several studies on neuroendocrine tumors have reported that bcl-2 or p53 expression might be correlated with malignant behavior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–17, 19, 23–27\\]</u>. However, no studies were found in which investigation was limited to SPC. Therefore, we tried to establish the immunohistochemical prognostic indicators of SPC by using bcl-2 and p53, which are acceptable prognostic indicators in several types of neuroendocrine tumor. As a result, the tumor cells showed negative reactivity for p53, which may reflect a good prognosis in patients with SPC. However, the tumor cells showed positive reactivity for bcl-2, which is a poor prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【17】To explain this paradoxical result, we considered the meaning of bcl-2 expression in breast cancer. Won et al. reported that beclin-1 and bcl-2 expression might play a role in the inhibition of the development of breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Therefore, we suggested that bcl-2 expression also reflexes the good prognosis of the patients with SPC rather than prognostic indicators in several kinds of neuroendocrine tumor. Unfortunately, our immunohistochemical examinations are based on only one patient with SPC. To confirm this hypothesis, further investigation is required.\n\n【18】#### Competing Interests\n\n【19】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We describe the case of a 28-year-old patient who presented with an ischemic stroke secondary to a stab wound to the neck that affected the vertebral artery. A physical examination revealed neurological deterioration (Glasgow 8/15), a sutured neck wound, no palpable hematoma, no thrills, and no active bleeding. A computed tomography angiography revealed a left vertebral artery arteriovenous fistula with a component of a pseudoaneurysm, for which a neurointerventional consultation was carried out. Due to neurological compromise, the airway was secured, and because the case involved a posterior fossa infarction with compression of the fourth ventricle and obstructive secondary hydrocephalus, an external ventricular shunt was inserted by neurosurgery. A fistula occlusion was performed with five Axium coils and a vial of Squid 12; the vertebral artery was catheterized, and a craniotomy was performed to manage hydrocephalus with a 12-mm H<sub>2</sub>O collecting system.

Introduction\n\n【3】Vertebral artery injuries can be spontaneous or caused by trauma. Traumatic injuries are frequently caused by blunt head and neck injuries but can also be caused by penetrating trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Vertebral artery partial dissection is a common cause of stroke in young adults without predisposing risk factors for cerebrovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Initial signs of vertebral artery dissection are usually head and neck pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>; however, patients may be asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The vertebral arteries perfuse the posterior fossa, and dissection causes apoplexy symptoms consistent with a posterior circulation deficit. Difficulty speaking, swallowing, and maintaining balance may also be observed in addition to the loss of coordination and/or changes in vision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Most injuries to the vertebral arteries are due to blunt trauma from motor vehicle accidents, and cases related to sports, trampoline use, sexual intercourse, yoga, scuba diving, and chiropractic neck manipulation have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, a few cases have been reported in association with stab wounds and strokes. This report describes an ischemic stroke secondary to a stab wound to the neck in a young adult with no history of cerebrovascular disease.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 28-year-old male patient with a traumatic wound in zone II of the neck produced after being stabbed during a fight was initially taken to a lower-complexity hospital, where he was discharged because no serious tissue injuries were found. Computed tomography angiography was not performed in this hospital because this institution does not have this resource; however, initial stabilization was implemented, the wound was sutured, analgesics were prescribed, and a tetanus toxoid vaccine was administered. However, 2 days later, the patient consulted a higher-level hospital for episodes of hematemesis and syncope.\n\n【7】Upon hospital admission, he presented the following vital signs: blood pressure 130/78 mmHg, heart rate 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. A physical examination revealed neurological deterioration (Glasgow 8/15), a sutured neck wound, no palpable hematoma, no thrills, no active bleeding, and no other findings. An emergent simple skull computed tomography (CT) was performed, which indicated cerebellar stroke and obstructing hydrocephalus . An emergent head and neck angiotomography indicated a compromise of the vertebral artery with a pseudoaneurysm . An emergent panangiography was scheduled in consultation with a neurointerventional service. CT angiography revealed a compromise of the left vertebral artery with an appearance suggestive of a pseudoaneurysm, for which a neurointerventional consultation was carried out.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Simple skull tomography.

The pseudoaneurysm measures 8.5 mm anteroposterior diameter, 7.3 mm transverse diameter, and 8 mm craniocaudal diameter.

Subsequently, neurointerventional fistula occlusion was performed with five coils and a vial of Squid 12; the vertebral artery was catheterized, and a craniotomy was performed by neurosurgery to manage hydrocephalus with a 12-mm H<sub>2</sub>O collecting system.\n\n【12】The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit.

Discussion\n\n【17】Traumatic vertebral artery injury is a relatively rare condition, reported in less than 1% of trauma admissions. However, a recent increase in incidence has been described, probably due to greater awareness and detection of this condition in high-risk patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 5\\]</u>. Although the literature reports cases of traumatic injury to the vertebral artery by knives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–9\\]</u>, there are few cases involving ischemic stroke secondary to a stab wound to the neck that affects the vertebral artery. Similar to the present case, Park et al. described a case of cerebellar infarction produced by vertebral artery injury from a stab wound that separated the vessel between the transverse processes of C3 and C4 with a hypoplastic contralateral vertebral artery. The patient suffered an infarction of the cerebellum due to insufficient preservation of blood flow in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The neurologic consequences of vertebral artery injury are due to cerebral ischemia from thromboembolism, hypoperfusion, hemorrhage, or a combination of these. Generally, vertebral artery injury is caused by an intimal tear, generating platelet aggregation and thrombus formation that can cause local occlusion of the vessel. However, more often, the clot will embolize the cerebral circulation, causing a stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【19】As observed in the present case, partial dissection of the vertebral artery can also cause a pseudoaneurysm, which can become a source of emboli or hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 11\\]</u> Moreover, the risk of stroke is highest in the first 2 weeks after partial dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【20】CT angiography (CTA) is the most reliable noninvasive neurovascular imaging modality and is the initial test of choice for patients with suspected cerebral artery injury. However, digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) has been indicated as the gold standard, although it is more invasive, less available, and requires more contrast than angiography. Consequently, CTA has replaced DSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5, 7, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Symptomatic patients may be treated with anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy, depending on the risk of bleeding and the location and extent of the lesion. As in the present case, endovascular therapy and surgical repair are reserved for patients with high-grade injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 9, 11\\]</u>; it is also recommended for patients with contraindications to anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy who are at high risk of progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The prognosis for patients with a vertebral artery injury reflects a 24% stroke rate and an 8% mortality rate; between 5% and 25% of patients have poor neurological outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Poor outcomes are associated with older age, arterial occlusion, and increased stroke severity at the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

She was immobilized in a cast for 10 days and was not allowed passive nor active range of motion exercises. Ten days after the injury the patient was evaluated for routine postoperative follow-up.

After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed in lateral decubitus and the left arm was placed over a bolster. A midline posterior incision was used to expose the proximal ulna. An osteotomy was performed at the level of the depressed articular surface to mobilize and elevate the depressed fragments in an attempt to realign the articular surfaces of the ulnohumeral joint. Reduction of the malunited intra-articular fragments was not possible because the fracture fragments were sclerotic. Shortening of the olecranon due to axial impaction—which was worsened by the tension-band construct—prohibited good alignment. An iliac-crest bone graft, 6 mm by 15 mm in size, was interposed to widen and reconstruct the trochlear notch. After lengthening of the proximal olecranon, the humerus could be easily reduced to restore ulnohumeral congruency. Stable fixation was achieved with 2 lag screws secured with a 4-hole LCP plate . It was noted that the posterior capsule was contracted. However, at this point it was chosen not to perform a posterior capsular release to preserve the surrounding soft tissues of the olecranon tip to protect vascular blood supply. Postoperatively, the patient was immobilized in a long arm cast and continuous passive motion was initiated 24 hours after surgery and therapy was started. Careful active motion also began immediately under the supervision of a physical therapist.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | An iliac-crest bone graft, 6 mm by 15 mm in size, was interposed to widen and reconstruct the trochlear notch.

Discussion\n\n【16】This is the first report in literature of an olecranon osteotomy with autograft lengthening to widen and reconstruct the trochlear notch and thus restoring ulnohumeral alignment after olecranon malunion. It is well established that effective treatment of fracture-dislocations of the olecranon requires a stable trochlear notch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. Simple transverse fractures only benefit from figure-of-eight tension band wiring with predictable outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 8\\]</u>. The goal of this technique is to convert the extensor force of the triceps to a dynamic compression force along the articular surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. This compressive force results in shortening of the trochlear notch if the fracture is comminuted as is illustrated in this case.\n\n【17】Postoperative immobilization further impaired a functional result in this case. Internal fixation must restore articular congruency and must be stable enough to allow for early mobilization. In this case the patient was immobilized for 10 days without continuous passive motion directly postoperative which resulted in only 65 degrees of ulnohumeral motion. However, impingement due to the depressed articular surface was the main reason for dysfunctional range of motion.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】An osteotomy with interposition of iliac crest bone graft and lengthening of the proximal olecranon can be used to restore the trochlear notch and ulnohumeral congruency.

We report a pilot study of the effects of Nichi Glucan, 1, 3-1, 6 Beta Glucan food supplement, in lowering the blood glucose and lipid levels in three patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) from India. These patients had increased blood glucose and lipid levels inspite of routine antidiabetic and lipid level lowering medications. Each of the participants took 1.5 g of Nichi Glucan per day with food for two months along with their routine medications. The relevant parameters to assess glycemic status and lipid levels were calculated at the baseline and at the end of two months. After two months of continuous consumption, in one patient, the HbA1c decreased from 9.1% to 7.8%, and the glycemic target of HbA1c <6.5% laid down by the International Diabetes Federation was reached in two patients. Lipid levels also decreased significantly. Based on our findings, Nichi Glucan food supplement can be considered along with routine medications in patients with Type II diabetes with hyperlipidemia. Further studies are needed to validate the results.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The rampantly increasing incidence of lifestyle changes has contributed to the massive increase in the prevalence of diabetes with nearly 51 million people suffering from Diabetes in India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There is also growing concern on the term “Asian Indian Phenotype,” which refers to certain unique clinical and biochemical abnormalities in Indians, including an increased insulin resistance, greater abdominal adiposity, dyslipidemia with low HDL cholesterol, elevated serum triglycerides and increased small, dense LDL cholesterol, which further with an increased ethnic susceptibility makes Indians at high risk for diabetes and premature coronary artery disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Studies indicate that 31.4% of the population in South India have abdominal obesity, 45.6% have hypertriglyceridemia, 65.5% have low HDL, 55.4% have hypertension, and 26.7% have raised fasting plasma glucose, all of which are major features of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Type II Diabetes or the noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is the more common type of diabetes with its prevalence particularly higher in South India compared to other parts of India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition to the influence on health, the toll of diabetes on the country’s economy is alarming with nearly 2.1% of the nation’s GDP spent on treatment for diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this regard, apart from therapeutic interventions such as oral glucose lowering drugs and insulin, dietary supplements are a potential intervention, both preventive and therapeutic. In this context, Beta Glucan-based food supplements have been developed for the treatment of various diseases including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cancer, and infectious diseases with promising results, based on clinical studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Beta Glucans are polysaccharides with glucose residues joined by beta linkage found in the cell wall of certain fungi, yeast, oat, barley, bacteria, and so forth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, such Beta Glucan-based food supplements for lowering glucose levels and treating metabolic syndrome have not gathered prominence in India. Herein, we report the effects of a food supplement, Nichi Glucan, which is 1, 3-1, 6 Beta Glucan, in lowering the blood glucose and lipid levels on the basis of results obtained from a preliminary study involving three patients with NIDDM from South India.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】##### 2.1. The Nichi Glucan\n\n【6】The Beta Glucan used in the study is Nichi Glucan, a commercially available, water soluble 1, 3-1, 6 Beta Glucan obtained from the cultured black yeast (Aureobasidium pullulans), which is an approved health food supplement in Japan. The Nichi Glucan contains 5% β\\-1, 3-1, 6-glucan, 71% starch, 13% corn starch, 13% Aureobasidium nutrient solution as thickening agent, 2% tricalcium phosphate, and 1% pullulans as manufacturing solutions. The aqueous solutions are used during the manufacturing process; however, the above percentages were calculated based on the dry weight of the product. The Nichi Glucan was supplied by GN Corporation through Nichi-Vision Life Sciences (NVLS), India. It was given to the participants of the study in the form of sachets each containing 0.5 g granules of Nichi Glucan. The participants were advised to take three of such sachets per day, one at morning, one at afternoon, and one at night as a food supplement for two months. The HbA1c, fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels, serum cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels were calculated before starting the Nichi Glucan supplement and at the end of two months.\n\n【7】##### 2.2. Description of Participants Included in the Study\n\n【8】Three participants were included in the study. All three were from South India. One of them (Patient III) was a vegetarian on all days but could consume all kinds of milk products and the other two (Patients I and II) were vegetarian on selected days but could consume milk products on all days and nonvegetarian food such as egg products, chicken, fish, and lamb as animal proteins on other days. Food intake and physical activity were quantified at the baseline by a physician. All three participants had undergone individual counselling by a common physician during the study period concerning daily food intake, and they were advised to consume a diet similar to their consumption prior to the starting of the Nichi Glucan intake. All three participants did only mild exercise such as walking for 30 minutes, simple non-strenuous domestic work, and travelling by public transport. The participants were advised not to change their diet habits or physical activity during the study. Every two weeks during the study, the food intake and physical activity were evaluated by the same physician who evaluated them before the start of the study.\n\n【9】###### 2.2.1. Patient I\n\n【10】A 46-year-old male, white collar job holder, BMI of 24.2, with history of hypertension for 10 years, and has Type II diabetes for the past 10 years. He has been taking insulin injection, 12 units at morning and night for past six years. He has also been prescribed Metformin 500 mg one tablet at morning and night and 1000 mg at noon and Pioglitazone 15 mg twice daily. He is not a smoker but consumes alcohol occasionally. He also had an elevated lipid profile, for which he was prescribed Atorvastatin 40 mg and Fenofibrate 67 mg twice daily. He started taking Nichi-Glucan as a food supplement in the dosage described above, on the 20th November 2011, and his parameters of relevance were measured before and after taking Nichi-Glucan for two months. During this period of two months, he did not change his food habits or other lifestyle related events. His antiglycemic medications were also continued as before.\n\n【11】###### 2.2.2. Patient II\n\n【12】A 60-year-old female, house wife, BMI of 26.6, with history of hypertension for five years, under medication with Amlodipine 5 mg once daily, and Type II diabetes for 1 year. She has been taking oral antidiabetic agent (Metformin) 500 mg thrice daily after food for the past one year. She had an elevated lipid profile, for which she was prescribed lipid-lowering drugs, but she did not follow it due to side effects of nausea and vomiting after taking the drugs initially. She started taking Nichi Glucan as a food supplement in the dosage described above, on 28th November 2011, and her parameters of relevance were measured before and after taking Nichi Glucan for two months. During this period of two months, she did not change her food habits or other lifestyle related events. Her antidiabetic medications were also continued as before.\n\n【13】###### 2.2.3. Patient III\n\n【14】A 63-year-old female, house wife, with a BMI of 26.1, with Type II diabetes for the past one year and on insulin 16 units in the morning and 12 units in the night along with Metformin 500 mg thrice daily and Pioglitazone 15 mg twice daily, started taking Nichi Glucan as a food supplement on 26th November 2011, and her parameters of relevance were measured before and after taking Nichi Glucan for two months. She is neither a smoker nor consumes alcohol. During this period of two months, she did not change her food habits or other lifestyle related events. Her antidiabetic medications were also continued as before.\n\n【15】The study was done in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and all the participants were included in the study after proper informed consent.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【17】The HbA1c levels and fasting, postprandial blood glucose levels before and after taking Nichi Glucan are depicted in Table 1. It can be observed that in spite of the antidiabetic medication, the glycemic target, HbA1c <6.5%, laid down by the International Diabetes Federation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> was not achieved in any of the patients prior to Nichi Glucan supplementation. However, after Nichi Glucan supplementation, there is a decrease in the blood glucose levels in all of the three patients with the glycemic target reached in two of the patients (Patient II—HbA1c—5.9% and Patient III—HbA1c—5.6%). A decrease in total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides and an increase in HDL levels can also be appreciated after Nichi Glucan supplementation.\n\n【18】Table 1 Characteristics of patients and study parameters of relevance before and after food supplementation with Nichi Glucan.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【20】Diabetes has a global prevalence of 366 million in 2011, and this figure is expected to increase to 552 million by 2030 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Current treatments of Diabetes both Types I and II include diet modifications, exercise, insulin injection, and glucose-lowering drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Metabolic syndrome, which includes diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, is another facet of consideration, particularly in Indian diabetic patients. With the increasing evidence of the Asian Indian Phenotype in whom, diabetes sets in at least a decade earlier compared to their western counterparts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, the need to control the glycemic level and hyperlipidemia in Indians becomes increasingly more important. At this juncture, the role of food supplements in reducing the blood glucose and lipid levels needs attention.\n\n【21】There are several literatures which have reported the efficacy of Beta Glucan food supplements in lowering blood glucose levels, improving glucose tolerance, decreasing hyperlipidemia, improving immunity, and decreasing infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–13\\]</u>. Antitumour properties of Beta Glucans have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Beta Glucans are obtained from a variety of sources like fungi, mushrooms, oats barley, and other bacteria. Fungal Beta Glucans have 1, 3-1, 6 linkages while those from oats and barley have 1, 3-1, 4 linkages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The Beta Glucan used in this study was obtained from a black yeast known as Aureobasidium pullulans (Strain AFO-202) isolated by Dr. Ikewaki et al. which secretes the 1, 3-1, 6 Beta Glucans extracellularly in the culture medium. Hence refining and purification are relatively simple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Further, it is odorless, water soluble, and does not change the taste or flavor of the food thus making it an ideal food supplement. It can also be used as a food additive due to its water retentive and thickening characteristics. This Beta Glucan is already available as a commercial health food supplement, but the efficacy of the same in Type II diabetes patients in India has not been yet reported.\n\n【22】From the results of this study, it can be observed that there is a significant decrease in the glycemic levels in all of the three patients, wherein in the first two patients, the HbA1c levels decreased by 1.3%, while in the third patient, the HbA1c level decreased by a significant 4.2% . The fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels also decreased considerably. A consensus article by the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes states that the expected decrease of HbA1c levels with Metformin and Thiazolidinedione monotherapy is 1%-2%, and with Insulin a decrease of 1.5%–3.5% can be expected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In all these three patients, before supplementation with Beta Glucan, the glycemic target of HbA1c <6.5% was not achieved, and plasma glucose levels were high in spite of intake of antidiabetic medication including insulin injections in two of the patients, but after supplementation glycemic target was achieved in two of the patients. Plasma Glucose levels also returned to the normal range. The average decrease in the levels before and after Beta Glucan supplementation of the total cholesterol (2.05 mmol/L), LDL (1.91 mmol/L) and Triglycerides levels (1.04 mmol/L) is comparable or even slightly higher than the levels reported in other literatures including a meta-analysis on changes in the lipid profile after Beta Glucan consumption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. The HDL cholesterol levels also increased after Nichi Glucan supplementation which is another favorable response. As the patients did not change their food habits or physical activity during the study, the influence of these factors on the reduction of HbA1c levels and total cholesterol, LDL, and Triglyceride levels may be considered negligible or minimal.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | HbA1c Levels before and after food supplementation with Nichi Glucan. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【24】The total quantity of Nichi Glucan consumed was only 1.5 g per day, and since the three subjects involved in the study were used to a relatively fibre dominant south Indian diet, this 1.5 g in addition to the diet did not amount to a significant proportion leading to any high fibre-related side effect. Also in a study done in 27 elderly people aged above 70 years, it has been confirmed that an oral administration of nearly 150 mg/day of β\\-1, 3-1, 6-glucan similar to the one used in the study, through gastronomy or nasal tube, for a period of 3 months, did not have any adverse changes on the levels of Na, K, Cl, glucose, uric acid, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglyceride, total protein, albumin, and cholinesterase, γ\\-GTP, AST, ALT, and CRP in the blood of the subjects as revealed by biochemical screening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Our study has limitations of any observational study based on few patients. Hence, our findings need to be interpreted with caution. However, on the basis of limited information available from three patients, we hypothesize that three-time intakes of 0.5 g Nichi Glucan daily can serve as an effective food supplementation to diabetics with particular relevance to Indians who have concomitant risk of development of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease associated with diabetes. However, this needs evidence from large randomized controlled trials in such patients.\n\n【26】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【27】Daily food supplementation with 1, 3-1, 6 Beta Glucan (Nichi Glucan) along with routine antidiabetic and lipid-lowering drugs has favorable response in improving glycemic status and lipid status in Indian Patients with Type II Diabetes with hyperlipidemia. Further studies with larger samples are needed to validate the results.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

One of the features of AVC involves compression of the left innominate vein with variability in luminal caliber on inspiration and expiration. Imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) examination can aid in initial diagnosis; however, venography can be utilized for confirmatory diagnosis due to its higher specificity during the inspiratory and expiratory phases. Through findings demonstrated during venography, we herein present two cases of confirmed AVC secondary to an aberrant right subclavian artery. Characteristic imaging features in the diagnosis of AVC and its etiology are discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Aortosternal venous compression (AVC) was first described by Wurtz et al. in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a rare venous compression syndrome that is commonly asymptomatic in otherwise healthy patients due to compensation by collateral vasculature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Scarcely reported symptoms in the literature include left upper extremity edema and intermittent instances of pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Although mediastinal masses can result in external compression of the underlying vasculature within the anterior or superior mediastinum, AVC is a diagnosis of exclusion. It can be caused by tortuous and/or ectatic great vessels resulting in associated compression on the underlying brachiocephalic vein in the setting of a diminished anterior-posterior chest diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 5\\]</u>. Three instances of an aberrant right subclavian artery have been reported in the literature as the causative agent of AVC; however, the prevalence of this etiology has yet to be established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We present two cases of AVC, in the setting of anatomical variation of aberrant right subclavian artery, wherein chest computed tomography (CT) and venography were utilized in establishing this rare diagnosis and its etiology.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 72-year-old female presented with ongoing paresthesia and “pulsations” of the right neck and scalp. Her medical history includes an asymptomatic congenital coronary to pulmonary artery fistula that was monitored without any surgical intervention. The patient denied any loss of consciousness, tinnitus, or slurred speech. Physical examination demonstrated a lack of neck or facial swelling, lack of skin discoloration, and absence of dysphagia. A focused upper extremity exam revealed intact sensations, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, normal muscle tone and motor strength 5/5, in addition to a steady gait. Laboratory investigations showed an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.0 and an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 29. Complete blood count (CBC), Vitamin B12, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were all within normal limits.\n\n【8】Due to the ongoing paresthesia, a contrast-enhanced CT head and neck was ordered. Initial imaging revealed an aberrant right subclavian artery with a course dorsal to the esophagus and an anteroposterior (AP) chest diameter of 6.4 cm . An ultrasound of the neck was ordered as part of the workup  which demonstrated no thrombus within either internal jugular vein (IJV) but did show the diffuse slow flow of the left IJV, with the near stagnant flow in the proximal left IJV. Findings were nonspecific; however, the layered appearance could be seen in the setting of underlying proximal compression/obstruction.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Axial contrast-enhanced CT images (CTA neck) demonstrate the anatomical variation of an aberrant right subclavian artery (yellow arrow) with its course posterior to the esophagus, resulting in an impression along the dorsal aspect of the esophagus.

Anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 8 cm on inspiratory phase. (b) Axial contrast-enhanced CT images (CTA neck): retrospective analysis demonstrates an anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 6.4 cm in the expiratory phase.

(b) Diffuse slow flow of the compressible left IJV with the near stagnant flow in the proximal left IJV. (c) Comparison between the right IJV (A) and left IJV (B), with the left IJV demonstrating increased echogenicity of the blood suggesting underlying aggregation with near stagnant to and fro flow of blood. This layered appearance could be seen in the setting of underlying proximal compression/obstruction. Right IJV (A) was observed to be patent with the nonsluggish flow.</u>\n\n【11】The initial CT neck did not include the entire mediastinum within the field of view and thus additional imaging with a chest CT was ordered to rule out mediastinal mass as an etiology of proximal compression. The subsequent imaging did not reveal a mediastinal mass or aortic arch aneurysm, however, did demonstrate a left-sided aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery without a diverticulum of Kommerell. However, as the CT chest examination was performed during the expiratory phase, findings of brachiocephalic venous compression were noted. A comparison was made to the prior CT angiography (CTA) neck, with interval difference in the brachiocephalic venous caliber. Thus, an inspiratory phase of the chest CT was also performed in the same setting to further evaluate the change in luminal caliber of the brachiocephalic vein. Findings of the chest CT (with inspiration and expiration) revealed the left brachiocephalic vein to become severely stenotic on expiration with an AP chest diameter of 5.6 cm. Comparatively, during inspiration, the chest CT revelated a patent left brachiocephalic vein with an AP chest diameter of 8 cm . Findings were suspicious for AVC, and thus venography was ordered. The venogram was obtained through a left upper extremity venous catheter during both expiration and inspiration. The venogram demonstrated severe stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein during expiration with multiple venous collaterals around the site of obstruction . The venogram during inspiration demonstrated prompt flow of contrast across the left brachiocephalic vein with no evidence of obstruction. Previous exclusion of other aforementioned etiologies of venous compression, and the venographic findings mentioned above, led to a diagnosis of AVC in the setting of anatomical variation of an aberrant right subclavian artery.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 (a) Axial noncontrast CT obtained in full inspiration demonstrates patent left brachiocephalic vein (purple arrow).

The patient opted out of having any surgical intervention. The patient has since been lost to follow-up.\n\n【15】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【16】A 34-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of dysphagia and headaches accompanied by left orbital pain with visualization of occasional “squiggly lines” in the left eye. Additionally, she complained of a warm sensation overlying the left forehead and ipsilateral ear. She denied any pulsatile tinnitus, facial droop, or paresthesia. The medical history of the patient included tonsillectomy, with a family history of intracranial aneurysms, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, colorectal cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【17】On physical examination, she was alert and oriented to person, time, and place. No cranial or carotid bruits were observed. Normal ocular vision with no pathological nystagmus, proptosis, or diplopia was noted. The facial sensation was intact, and the muscles of facial expression were normal and symmetric. Motor examination revealed normal bulk, tone, power, and coordination in all 4 limbs with no pathological reflexes. The sensation was grossly normal. Romberg's testing was negative. Physical examination demonstrated a prominent left frontal superficial scallop vein that became prominent when a patient was placed in a left lateral decubitus position. The left frontal superficial scallop vein did not demonstrate prominence during spine flexion, right lateral decubitus, or upright positioning.\n\n【18】Due to the ongoing headaches and the prominent left frontal superficial vein, investigation with MRI of the brain and MR angiography (MRA) was performed. Findings of the MRA demonstrated no evidence of dural arteriovenous fistula, vascular thrombosis, arteriovenous (AV) shunting, or vascular malformation.\n\n【19】Further investigation with a CTA chest (inspiratory phase) was conducted to rule out a mediastinal mass resulting in venous compression. CTA chest demonstrated no evidence of a mediastinal mass; however, incidentally, an aberrant right subclavian artery was noted . Furthermore, there was mild compression of the brachiocephalic vein during this initial inspiratory phase, which warranted further investigation to rule out aortosternal venous compression 删除1:<u>(Figure 5(c))</u>. CTA in an expiratory phase was subsequently performed, demonstrating findings of severe stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein . Thus, a venogram was ordered as part of the workup in order to confirm the diagnosis of AVC. Findings of the venogram demonstrated a patent left subclavian and superior vena cava (SVC) with no significant stenosis with respect to the left brachiocephalic vein in the inspiratory phase 删除1:<u>(Figure 7(a))</u>. The subsequent expiratory phase 删除1:<u>(Figure 7(b))</u> demonstrated severe stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein, with cephalad reflux of contrast in the left IJV. Additionally, collateral supply arising from the left IJV and communicating with the right brachiocephalic vein was observed during the expiratory phase. The above findings were utilized to confirm the diagnosis of AVC with a component of cranial venous congestion.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 (a) Axial contrast-enhanced CT images (CTA neck) demonstrate the anatomical variation of an aberrant right subclavian artery (yellow arrow) with its course posterior to the esophagus.

Based on the last follow-up visit the patient is doing well with decreased severity of symptoms.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】##### 3.1. Symptoms and Presentation\n\n【26】Extrinsic venous compression can be observed in the setting of mediastinal mass compression given the rather confined anatomic space within the superior and anterior mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. AVC, characteristically regarded as brachiocephalic vein compression, is a rare form of extrinsic venous compression, first reported in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Tortuous and/or ectatic great vessels can act as another factor resulting in extrinsic compression of the brachiocephalic vein, particularly in patients with a diminished anteroposterior chest diameter. An aberrant right subclavian artery has also been associated with AVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. The prevalence of AVC has not been well characterized due to its rarity. A study in hemodialysis patients undergoing fistulograms identified some degree of extrinsic compression of the brachiocephalic vein in 44% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【27】AVC is often asymptomatic, due to adequate compensation by collateral vasculature; however, cases in the literature have described instances of pain and swelling in the supraclavicular region and left upper extremity, as well as morning headaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>. One case reported symptoms of paresthesia, thus, a similar symptomatic presentation to the first case presented in this case series. Even though rare, symptoms of paresthesia combined with pulsation, can lead the referring clinician to consider AVC as part of the differential workup 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Furthermore, the presence of an anatomical variant such as an aberrant right subclavian artery resulting in esophageal compression due to its dorsal course can result in dysphagia lusoria, which potentially accounts for the dysphagia observed in the second case presented above 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the atypical presentation of AVC and the variable etiology of this syndrome highlight the necessity of combining imaging modalities in confirming a diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【28】##### 3.2. Imaging Features\n\n【29】Few imaging modalities are employed in the diagnosis of venous compression syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Contrast-enhanced chest CT and diagnostic venography are imaging modalities that can be utilized to diagnose AVC. Initial imaging with ultrasound may demonstrate sluggish flow and/or intraluminal thrombus in the left subclavian, brachiocephalic, or left IJV, however, these findings are nonspecific as they primarily relate to proximal stenosis or obstruction, and thus further investigation into AVC or brachiocephalic vein compression is warranted with cross-sectional imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Based on a retrospective review of the literature, the importance of cross-sectional imaging for the evaluation of anatomical variation and in establishing the etiology of venous compression has been established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8, 9\\]</u>. Therefore, in the appropriate clinical setting, chest CT (with inspiratory and expiratory phase) can be utilized as the initial imaging modality to exclude an extrinsic venous compression etiology such as a mediastinal mass, aortic aneurysmal dilation, or compression secondary to the aortic arch anomaly. Even though the rare association of AVC with the aberrant right subclavian artery is noted in the literature, such a finding can be visualized on contrast-enhanced CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Once the brachiocephalic vein compression is suspected on CT, the next step of performing a diagnostic venogram can aid in real-time fluoroscopic evaluation, again in the setting of the inspiratory and expiratory phase, with the latter demonstrating venous compression. Secondary findings on the venogram, demonstrated by underlying collateral vascularity establish the chronicity of the diagnosis. The venogram can be performed via cannulating the basilic, cephalic or brachial veins, followed by advancing an angled catheter and a 0.035 Glidewire to access the distal left subclavian or axillary vein (proximal to the region of the stenosis). Alternatively, the catheter can also be advanced into the ipsilateral jugular vein. The angled catheter can be exchanged for a multipurpose side-hole catheter, through which a contrast injection can be performed in the inspiratory and expiratory phases. The patency within the left subclavian vein, LIJ, and left brachiocephalic vein during inspiration excludes an underlying acute or chronic thrombus as an etiology, thus highlighting the importance of a biphasic exam 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Therefore, the ability to visualize flow dynamics in venography can aid in establishing a firm AVC diagnosis, and thus venography could potentially be established as a gold standard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Moreover, during cross-sectional imaging, the AP diameter (dorsal aspect of the manubrium to the ventral aspect of the vertebral body) can be measured, at the level of the brachiocephalic vein in both inspiratory and expiratory phases of the examination. Upon expiration, the AP diameter diminishes, with a confined mediastinal anatomic space. Even though there are no established AP diameter parameters, a significant decrease in expiratory phase diameter should prompt further investigation into AVC or brachiocephalic vein compression. Furthermore, aberrant right subclavian arteries, which are the most common embryologic abnormality of the aortic arch, result as an additive feature to the already confined anatomic space in the mediastinum which further predisposes patients to brachiocephalic vein compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 12\\]</u>. Therefore, upon findings of an aberrant right subclavian artery with the appropriate abovementioned clinical symptoms, the patient could be assessed for AVC as a potential etiology once other differentials have been excluded. Nevertheless, standard variations in AP diameters on inspiration versus expiration, and the incidence of aberrant right subclavian arteries as the cause of AVC have yet to be established, drawing attention to the need for future studies on this topic.\n\n【31】#### 4\\. Treatment and Discussion\n\n【32】Conservative management remains the mainstay in AVC and includes arm elevation at night as well as avoidance of the left lateral decubitus position to reduce pressure on the brachiocephalic vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In our institution, conservative management has proven to be sufficient in managing the symptoms and complaints of AVC. However, surgical management may be required for symptomatic cases of compression in the setting of conservative management failure. Yet, surgery is an invasive option that carries risks and thus is not recommended as a first-line approach. Therefore, conservative management is the advisable treatment option in symptomatic venous compression patients as a first-line approach. In patients who fail conservative management, angioplasty and self-expanding stents are treatment methods of choice in common venous compression syndromes such as Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS), nutcracker syndrome, and May–Thurner syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. A literature review also demonstrated that self-expanding stents can successfully treat symptomatic stenosis of the brachiocephalic vein, particularly in hemodialysis patients where dialysis access may be threatened 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, due to the extrinsic nature of compression, stents are not recommended in AVC patients due to limited patency and allowable volume changes of the vascular space during respiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 14\\]</u>. In the setting of the patient not being a surgical candidate and failing conservative management, the stenosis could potentially be treated with self-expandable stents. Notably, balloon expandable stents should also be avoided in AVC management as they can be crushed and can migrate secondary to external compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In severe cases of venous compression syndromes, operative decompression of the thoracic inlet including manubrioplasty has been employed as a radical approach to address the underlying anatomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the long-term prognosis is unknown due to limited cases in the literature.\n\n【33】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【34】AVC is a rare extrinsic venous compression syndrome.

The incidental finding of a solid nodular lesion with irregular margins adjacent to the visceral pleura in the reported case was highly suggestive of malignancy. The present report underscores the typical immunohistochemical findings and the benign course of nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. The current knowledge about disease aetiology and the value of different diagnostic tools to distinguish nodular lymphoid hyperplasia from other pulmonary lymphoid lesions are summarized by a review of the literature. Surgical resection is not only diagnostic but also curative with no evidence so far that NLH can regress without operation. The present case shows the spontaneous regression of NLH after CT-guided biopsy indicating that an alternative, less invasive diagnostic approach has curative potential.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 64-year-old female presented to the hospital because of suspected traumatic rib injury. She never complained a cough, no fever, weight loss, or night sweats. Chest X-ray did not reveal a fracture but unexpectedly showed a mass in the right upper lobe. This finding was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) showing a solid nodular lesion with irregular margins adjacent to the visceral pleura with a diameter of 1.2 inches in the upper right lobe . Under suspicion of malignancy, a CT-navigated core biopsy (diameter: 0.75 inches) was obtained showing well-defined lymphoid tissue masses with numerous reactive germinal centers, interfollicular lymphocytes, and plasma cells . Immunohistochemically, plasma cells that were reactive for both κ\\- and λ\\-light chain immunoglobulins supporting a polyclonal population 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c) and 2(d))</u>, and lymphocyte subset markers such as CD20 and CD10 identified B cells, which were negative for Bcl-2 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(e))</u>. CD3-positive T cells showed reactive patterns in the interfollicular zone. Ki-67 staining confirmed a high proliferative activity in reactive follicles with no evidence of malignancy 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(f))</u>. These histological findings could exclude a lymphoma and resulted in the diagnosis of NLH. The postinterventional course was uneventful. A CT of the chest 5 years later confirmed the benign nature of the tumour with complete regression leaving only a small scar in the area of former lesion.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest computed tomography scans.

Discussion\n\n【9】The present case underscores the typical immunohistochemical findings and the benign course of NLH, a rare pulmonary disease with morphological features which are highly suggestive of malignancy. The disease was first described by Kradin and Mark in 1983 and is characterized by one or more benign nodules or localized lung infiltrates composed of reactive lymphoid cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【10】In these mostly asymptomatic patients, the nodules are typically incidental findings in subpleural, occasionally peribronchial location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Large airways involvement is uncommon. If symptoms occur they are unspecific, including cough, dyspnea, and pleuritic pain. Females are slightly more often affected than males in a ratio of 4 : 3. The age differs largely from 19 to 80 years (median 60 years). Mediastinal or hilar adenopathy is present in approximately one-third of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The pathogenesis of NLH is unknown. Song et al. identified NLH in a patient with Sjogren’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> although others did not suggest an association with collagen vascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The lesion is usually detected first in an X-ray or CT from the chest. However, there is no radiographic sign specific for NLH, especially in the distinction to malignant tumours. Based on a series of 67 patients, Fang et al. described the typical radiological manifestations of pulmonary NLH as solitary, or multinodular, solid or subsolid nodules with a wide array of additional radiographic findings, including lobulation, spiculation, vessel convergence, and pleural indentation as well as mediastinal or hilar lymph node involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Even in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), the imaging findings can be very similar to those of lung cancer with varying FDG uptakes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Due to these radiographic signs of malignancy, most patients with NLH primarily undergo surgical lobectomy or sublobular resection of the lung without recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【12】To date, there is only little evidence of spontaneous regression of pulmonary NLH without operation. Some studies reported the regression of remaining lesions following the surgical resection of one nodule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u> and another report described the reduction of an abnormal lung shadow in NLH induced by antibiotic treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Surgical resection of NLH is therefore widely accepted not only as a diagnostic but also as a curative measure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, these patients would experience substantial loss of normal lung parenchyma for a benign condition, especially after complete lobectomy. To our knowledge, the present case is the first description of spontaneous regression of pulmonary NLH after CT-guided needle biopsy supporting an alternative, less invasive, and debilitating diagnostic approach with curative potential.\n\n【13】The histological picture of NLH is characterized by a dense nodular infiltration of mature, polyclonal lymphocytes and plasma cells with multiple reactive germinal centers, sharply demarcated from surrounding parenchyma and with central areas of scarring. Immunohistochemical staining shows a mixture of B cells with polytypic κ\\- and λ\\-light chain expression and T cells in the lymphoid infiltrate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These histopathologic features need to be identified in order to distinguish NLH from other neoplastic lymphoproliferative pulmonary lesions. Differential diagnoses include the extranodal MALT lymphoma, which is similarly characterized by a mixed population of lymphoid cells with abundant plasma cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. However, while NLH is a polyclonal lymphatic disorder, the MALT lymphoma shows monoclonal tumour cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 15\\]</u>. In addition, Dutcher bodies and pleural and bronchus invasion are common features of MALT lymphoma. Other low-grade lymphomas such as small lymphocytic lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia could mimic NLH as well, but most such cases show a more diffuse infiltrative pattern rather than formation of well-defined nodules. Further differential diagnoses to be considered include the benign/non-neoplastic pulmonary lymphoid disorders such as lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP), follicular bronchiolitis (FB), or inflammatory pseudotumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>. LIP usually shows dense infiltration of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes resulting in a diffuse alveolar widening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In addition, the growth pattern is diffuse usually involving the entire lung, rather than nodular in appearance. FB is a lymphoid follicular hyperplasia with germinal centers as well, but can be distinguished from NLH by its location: while NLH is usually located in the subpleural area, and FB is typically distributed along the bronchiolar walls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Some cases may exhibit overlapping features, and the distinction among these entities can be arbitrary. In these cases, the synopsis of clinical, radiographic, and histologic features may help to distinguish between entities.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】NLH is a benign pulmonary disease with morphological features which are highly suggestive of malignancy. To date, the diagnosis is based on the typical histopathological findings with dense nodular infiltration of mature, polyclonal lymphocytes and plasma cells. Surgical resection of the tumour is the standard diagnostic and therapeutic approach to date, and there was no evidence so far that NLH can regress without operation. The present case shows the spontaneous complete reduction of NLH after CT-guided biopsy highlighting an alternative, less-invasive diagnostic approach with curative potential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Although small-bowel bleeding was suspected, no bleeding source was identified by enhanced computed tomography (CT), video capsule endoscopy (VCE), and double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). Five years later, the patient had recurrent intermittent bloody stools with a significant decrease in hemoglobin levels. Although no active bleeding was observed on antegrade DBE, we detected a pulsatile submucosal uplift accompanied by a small red patch on the top of the uplift in the jejunum. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was suspected as the cause of small-bowel bleeding. Multiple-phase CT showed a number of small vascular ectasias during the arterial phase in the jejunum, and we confirmed the presence of multiple AVMs in the jejunum by selective angiography. To identify the location of the lesions and determine the minimal surgical margins, we performed intraoperative selective angiography with indocyanine green (ICG) injection. This technique allowed us to clearly observe the region and perform segmental small-bowel resection with minimal surgical margin. The patient reported that she has had no gastrointestinal bleeding at the two years follow-up visit.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The source of bleeding in approximately 5% of all gastrointestinal bleeding cases is from the small bowel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Abnormal blood vessels of the small bowel cause 20% to 30% of cases of small-bowel bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are an important vascular cause of small-bowel bleeding. However, it is often difficult to diagnose and treat AVMs of the small-bowel. Furthermore, it is challenging to determine the optimal surgical margin of the lesions when there are multiple lesions.\n\n【4】Herein, we report a case of multiple AVMs of the small-bowel that were detected by double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and in which we determined the optimal surgical margins using intraoperative selective angiography with indocyanine green (ICG) injection.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 62-year-old Japanese female was referred to our hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding five years prior to the current presentation. Five years before, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy could not identify any abnormalities. As abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) with delayed phase imaging did not reveal a source of the bleeding, video capsule endoscopy (VCE) was carried out for small-bowel evaluation. Although blood clots were detected in the jejunum, no bleeding source was identified. Subsequently, antegrade DBE was performed for further investigation. However, no active bleeding was observed, and no bleeding sources were detected. Thereafter, she had recurrent bloody stools intermittently about once a year. Although small-bowel evaluations including VCE, enhanced CT, and DBE were performed repeatedly, the cause of small-bowel bleeding could not be identified. Her current presentation was marked by intermittent bloody stools and a fall in hemoglobin level to as low as 8.7 g/dl. VCE was immediately performed and showed blood clots localized to the proximal jejunum, which failed to show a source of bleeding. This was followed by antegrade DBE to evaluate the jejunum intensively. On DBE, a pulsatile submucosal uplift, which was accompanied by a small red patch on the top of the uplift without active bleeding, was revealed in the jejunum 30 cm on the anal side from the ligament of Treitz 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. As an AVM was suspected as the cause of small-bowel bleeding, two clips were placed in close proximity to the submucosal uplift to control the arterial inflow for temporary bleeding prevention, which resulted in disappearance of pulsation and a color change by deterioration of blood flow in the lesion 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. Multiple-phase CT revealed multiple small vascular ectasias during the arterial phase and their early draining veins adjacent to the clips that had been placed in the jejunum on DBE . As multiple AVMs were suspected, a selective angiography was employed to identify the location of the lesions. Multifocal niduses were detected adjacent to the clips in the jejunum supplied by the second jejunal arteries . To determine the minimal and optimal surgical margins, we performed intraoperative selective angiography with ICG injection. 2.5 mg/ml of ICG in a total volume of 0.2 ml was injected intraoperatively from the second jejunal artery via a selective angiographic microcatheter, which immediately stained a 30 cm segment of the jejunum 删除1:<u>(Figures 4(a) and 4(b))</u>. ICG fluorescence enabled us to easily and clearly recognize the region and perform a segmental small-bowel resection with the minimal surgical margins. Pathological examination confirmed the presence of AVMs with features of tortuous, dilated veins, and arteries in the submucosal layer .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Antegrade double-balloon enteroscopy.

Discussion\n\n【14】Of all the sources of gastrointestinal bleeding, only a small percentage (5%) is attributed to a source in the small-bowel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In the small bowel, 20 to 30% of bleeding cases are caused by abnormal blood vessels, including angioectasias, AVMs, hemangiomas, and Dieulafoy’s lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. Especially, AVMs are the most common cause of small-bowel bleeding in people over the age of 50 years.\n\n【15】It can be exceedingly difficult to localize and diagnose the small-bowel AVMs, particularly in cases of occult bleeding. For hemodynamically stable patients who are suspected of having small-bowel bleeding, after EGD and colonoscopy with normal results, VCE is recommended as the next diagnostic test, and device-assisted enteroscopy can be considered in patients with positive bleeding sources identified on VCE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In general, AVMs in the small bowel have been described as submucosal uplift accompanied by redness, vascular proliferation, and vascular ectasia. However, most of them are findings in intraoperative endoscopy, and there are a limited number of cases diagnosed by preoperative endoscopy in the absence of active bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. The present case is a valuable report of AVMs in the small bowel that could be diagnosed by preoperative DBE, and the pulsatile submucosal uplift accompanied by a small red patch on the top might be an important finding that indicates AVMs. On the other hand, it is difficult to identify all the lesions by endoscopy in cases where multiple AVMs exist in the small bowel. In our case, we suspected the presence of multiple lesions based on the results of dynamic enhanced CT and confirmed it by selective angiography. In the diagnosis of AVM, dynamic enhanced CT and subsequent selective angiography as necessary to be performed, considering the possibility that there are multiple lesions.\n\n【16】With respect to the treatment of small-bowel AVMs, partial small-bowel resection with a minimal surgical margin is required for retaining small-bowel functions. However, it is exceedingly challenging to identify the location of lesions and determine the optimal surgical margin, especially in cases where there are multiple AVMs in the small bowel. A technique combining selective angiography with intraoperative methylene blue injection to aid the localization of obscure sources of GI bleeding, including AVMs, has been described in a number of case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. Although no reports described complications of this methylene blue injection technique, doses of 500 mg or greater of methylene blue can cause nausea, abdominal and chest pain, altered mental status, and methemoglobinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 12\\]</u>. ICG is a nontoxic, near-infrared fluorophore, and its clinical applications have been recently proposed in various surgical settings. To the best of our knowledge, there has only been one reported case of intraoperative enteric mapping of small-bowel AVMs using ICG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This new technique allows us to clearly visualize the regions of AVMs and immediately determine the optimal resection margins. Intraoperative selective angiography with ICG injection, which we performed in this case, is very safe and useful for the surgery of AVMs.\n\n【17】The optimal diagnosis and treatment strategy for multiple AVMs of the small bowel have not been fully elucidated. It has been reported that 5–37% of patients who underwent resection of AVMs will rebleed and one of the causes is incomplete excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 14, 15\\]</u>. The series of methods and techniques that we report here will contribute to the clinical treatment of AVMs of the small bowel.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Autoantibodies directed against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors cause a type of autoimmune encephalitis resulting in memory loss, confusion, and psychosis. A 28-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, seizure disorder, and stroke presented with a 2-day history of bizarre behavior, restlessness, insomnia, agitation, and hallucinations. He was initially managed for acute psychosis without any improvement. Further workup for organic causes revealed positive NMDAR antibodies in both the cerebrospinal fluid and serum, confirming a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. His condition later improved with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. This case signifies the importance of ruling out organic causes in patients with unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms. NMDA encephalitis is more common in young females with underlying malignancies, especially ovarian teratomas. This case is unique, given the extremely rare occurrence of NMDA encephalitis in male patients without any malignancies.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Autoimmune encephalitis is caused by autoantibodies against neuronal cell surface/synaptic proteins called N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. NMDARs play a significant role in maintaining synaptic plasticity and memory. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis has been associated with multiple infectious agents, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, herpes simplex virus, measles virus, mumps, and group-A hemolytic Streptococcus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Here, we describe the case of a young male with a known diagnosis of schizophrenia, presenting with confusion and hallucinations warranting psychiatric management and subsequently found to have anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 28-year-old male presented with a 2-day history of restlessness, bizarre behavior, confusion, and hallucinations. His past medical history was significant for schizophrenia, seizure disorder, and stroke with residual left-sided facial droop. There was no family history of psychiatric disorders. His family reported that he had no recent fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, runny nose, sore throat, cough, headaches, urinary symptoms, loss of appetite, or loss of weight. On physical examination, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was alert, oriented to person and place, but not to time. His fiancé reported that he had been pacing around his room, not sleeping, acting paranoid, and hearing voices. He was admitted to the psychiatry department for acute psychosis, where he was unsuccessfully managed with valproic acid, risperidone, and benztropine, with haloperidol and diphenhydramine as needed. A review of his chart revealed two past admissions for a similar presentation of acute psychosis, and he was discharged with outpatient psychiatry follow-up recommendation. The patient failed to follow-up as an outpatient, and no further workup was done at that time. His hospital course was complicated by worsening mental status, and he continued to be unresponsive to the abovementioned medications.\n\n【6】A thorough evaluation for organic causes was performed, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast, lumbar puncture (LP), and an autoimmune workup. The brain MRI with contrast showed multiple areas of bright signal intensity throughout the brain parenchyma, most notably in the medial temporal lobes and bilateral insular cortices, compatible with encephalitis . LP was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed white blood cell count, 8 mm<sup>3</sup>; neutrophils, 1 mm<sup>3</sup>; lymphocytes, 95%; protein, 35 mg/dl; and glucose, 56 mg/dl. CSF testing for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 DNA, varicella zoster PCR, VDRL, FTA ABS, enterovirus, and viral cultures were negative. A mild elevation of antinuclear antibody (1 : 40 titer) was noted. Blood and CSF were positive for oligoclonal bands.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Axial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) demonstrating bright signal intensity and gyriform swelling in the region of the uncus (a) and thalami and insular cortex (b).

The contrast study (d) does not show enhancement.</u>\n\n【8】Initially, the patient was started on empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for possible infectious causes of encephalitis. The diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis was confirmed when the CSF was found positive for NMDAR antibodies. Empiric antibiotics and acyclovir were discontinued, and the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 400 mg/kg/day for 5 days and methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 5 days.\n\n【9】The patient’s condition improved significantly. He was observed to have more meaningful conversations and an improvement in his pressured speech. Repeat MRI after two weeks showed decreased bright signal intensity, although swelling remained the same . The patient was discharged and was followed up as an outpatient with complete resolution of his symptoms.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Axial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) one and a half weeks after treatment with immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone demonstrating gyriform swelling of the temporal lobes (a), especially medially, best seen on flair sequences (a, c, d).

Compared to the earlier study, the degree of bright signal intensity is decreased, though swelling remains. These findings, with cortical, thalamic, and basal ganglia involvement, are typically seen in encephalitis.</u>\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Although this patient presented with features typical of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, his history of schizophrenia, seizures, and acute psychotic episodes contributed to delayed diagnosis. The classic presentation of this syndrome involves the development of psychiatric symptoms, memory loss, sleep disturbances, and seizures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Malignancy is a known risk factor, and teratomas, germ cell tumors of the testes, and small cell lung cancer are specifically hypothesized to be associated with the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. The presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies is specific for diagnosis. Although it has been associated with pathogens including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, herpes simplex virus, measles virus, mumps, and group-A hemolytic Streptococcus, these were all negative in our patient. The improvement of symptoms in our patient after treatment with IVIG and methylprednisolone further strengthens the diagnosis. The pathophysiology behind psychiatric manifestations of this disease is anti-NMDAR antibody inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid at the presynaptic junction in the thalamus and frontal cortex. Subsequently, postsynaptic glutaminergic neurons are uninhibited, resulting in dysregulation of the dopaminergic pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Diagnosis of probable anti-NMDAR encephalitis requires the onset of at least four of the following symptoms within 3 months: abnormal behavior or cognitive dysfunction, speech dysfunction, movement disorder, dyskinesia, rigidity/abnormal posture, decreased level of consciousness, autonomic dysfunction, or central hypoventilation. Patients must also have either an abnormal electroencephalogram or CSF with pleocytosis or oligoclonal bands and reasonable exclusion of other disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】For a definitive diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, IgG anti-GluN1 antibodies (NMDA receptor antibodies) should be positive in the presence of one or more of the six major groups of symptoms, after exclusion of other disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient met the diagnostic criteria for definitive anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The treatment approach to anti-NMDAR encephalitis includes removal of the etiological agents such as a tumor or treatment of the underlying infectious source and immunotherapy. The immunotherapies commonly used are corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, and plasma exchange with plasmapheresis in severe cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In resistant cases, immunosuppression is induced using rituximab, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and methotrexate. Our patient responded well to immunotherapy with methylprednisolone and IVIG. Although symptoms are usually severe, studies suggest that patients are usually highly responsive to therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. As per a reported case series of 99 patients with all-cause encephalitis, 9.1% were found to have anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The mean age of these patients was 28 years, and 5 of 9 were females. Follow-up of these patients showed zero mortality and complete symptomatic recovery after treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment will reduce mortality and ensure complete recovery.\n\n【15】In conclusion, anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a very rare entity in male patients, especially in those without any underlying malignancies. However, physicians should consider this diagnosis as a differential in any young patient presenting with unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms. Younger patients who present with an initial episode of bizarre behavior should be assessed to rule out major organic causes, as delay in diagnosis leads to poor patient outcomes. Although literature suggests a predominance of anti-NMDAR encephalitis occurs in women with ovarian teratomas, this case demonstrates that the diagnosis should also be considered in men without any signs and symptoms of a neoplastic process, and a thorough workup for the infectious source should be conducted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We present a case report of a 39-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with right flank pain that had progressed to severe back pain, bilateral flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain over the course of two days. The pain was severe enough to affect his daily activities. Laboratory investigations revealed a D-dimer level of 17 ng/mL, creatinine level of 110 µmol/L, and a white blood cell count of 10 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L with a CRP level of 5 mg/L. Urine analysis was positive for blood. Doppler ultrasound of both legs showed deep vein thrombosis extending from the external iliac veins to the distal veins of both legs. Further investigation with computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins. The patient was diagnosed with Factor V Leiden syndrome based on genetic testing, which revealed a heterozygous mutation in the F5 gene. He was successfully treated with low molecular weight heparin and warfarin, and after five days of hospitalization, he was discharged with warfarin for long-term anticoagulation.

Introduction\n\n【3】Thrombosis in the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a rare but serious condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. It is typically associated with vague symptoms such as abdominal pain, back pain, flank pain, leg pain, and swelling, which can vary in severity depending on the level of the thrombus in the vein. The causes of IVC thrombosis can vary, ranging from hypercoagulable states and tumors to pregnancy and congenital or acquired anomalies in the anatomy of the vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Although relatively uncommon, IVC thrombosis is associated with a higher risk of mortality than the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) alone, making early diagnosis and treatment essential for optimal patient outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In this case report, we describe a patient with thrombosis in the IVC who presented with a constellation of symptoms and underwent successful treatment with anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 39-year-old male presented to the emergency department with right flank pain that had progressed to severe back pain, bilateral flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain over the course of two days. The pain was severe enough to affect his daily activities. He had no significant medical history and had been treated with analgesics at a local health center prior to presenting to the emergency department. Given analgesics, the patient’s back pain decreased. However, he reported that his bilateral testicular pain and bilateral thigh pain became severe. His vital signs were BP 120/80 mmHg, pulse 130 beats/min, RR 20 breaths/min, and temperature 37°C. The leg raising test was negative, and the neurovascular bundle was intact. Scrotal exam was unremarkable. Since both the cremasteric reflex and Phren’s sign yielded negative results, an official scrotal Doppler ultrasound was not performed. There was no lower limb edema or swelling. Laboratory investigations revealed a D-dimer level of 17 mg/L (normal range: 0–0.49 mg/L), creatinine level of 124 µmol/L (normal range: 64–110 µmol/L), and a white blood cell count of 10 × 10<sup>3</sup>/L (normal range: 4–10 10<sup>3</sup>/L) with a CRP level of 5 mg/L (normal range: 0–5 mg/L). The patient’s prothrombin time showed a slight elevation at 13.8 seconds (normal range: 9.4–12.5 seconds), while APTT and INR levels remained within the normal ranges (APTT: 28.4 seconds, normal range: 25.1–36.5 seconds; INR: 1.1, normal range: ≤1.1).\n\n【7】Urine analysis was positive for blood. Bedside abdominal ultrasound showed no significant abnormalities. Doppler ultrasound of both legs showed deep vein thrombosis extending from the external iliac veins to the distal veins of both legs. Further investigation with computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins . There was no evidence of renal calculi or other abdominal pathology. Following admission, a comprehensive coagulopathy blood panel was conducted. Protein C levels were in the normal range (89%), but protein S levels were suboptimal (49.9%), likely influenced by the patient’s ongoing warfarin sodium therapy. Lupus anticoagulant was not detected, and the patient demonstrated effective anticoagulation with warfarin (ATAC 91%). Our patient, despite the absence of any family history of thrombosis, received a diagnosis of Factor V Leiden syndrome through genetic testing, which unveiled a heterozygous mutation in the F5 gene. He was started on low molecular weight heparin and warfarin, and after five days of hospitalization, he was discharged with warfarin for long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins.</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a serious condition that can cause a range of symptoms, making it a challenging diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This case report described a patient who presented with a variety of symptoms, including severe back pain, flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain, which were ultimately attributed to IVC thrombosis. The patient was successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【11】Our case report is unique in which it describes a patient with a large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins, which are relatively uncommon locations for IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In addition, the patient presented with a constellation of symptoms that included scrotal pain, which is an uncommon presentation of IVC thrombosis. The case also emphasizes the importance of genetic testing to identify underlying hypercoagulable states, such as Factor V Leiden syndrome, in patients with IVC thrombosis.\n\n【12】The symptoms of IVC thrombosis can be vague and nonspecific, making the diagnosis challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The patient in this case presented with right flank pain that had progressed to severe back pain, bilateral flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain over the course of two days. The pain was severe enough to affect his daily activities. These symptoms can be indicative of a variety of conditions, including musculoskeletal pain, urological disorders, and vascular disease, making it difficult to make an accurate diagnosis based on clinical presentation alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Laboratory investigations, including D-dimer levels, creatinine levels, and a white blood cell count, can help support the diagnosis of IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case, the patient had an elevated D-dimer level and a slightly elevated creatinine level. These laboratory findings are consistent with IVC thrombosis, as D-dimer is a marker of thrombosis, and an elevated creatinine level can be indicative of renal insufficiency, which can occur as a result of IVC thrombosis.\n\n【14】Sudden onset of testicular pain requires immediate evaluation, including a comprehensive medical history, thorough physical examination, urinalysis, and imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. An urgent situation such as testicular torsion, characterized by a high-riding testicle, demands swift action and confirmation to prevent potential testicular loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. Based on our examination and urinalysis, we were able to confidently rule out any potential medical emergencies for our patient. Although less frequent, nonscrotal factors can also trigger testicular pain due to shared nerve pathways (T10–T12, L1-L2, and S2–S4). Conditions such as kidney stones, lower back issues, aortic aneurysms, spinal disc protrusions, hernias, and other abdominal problems that utilize these common nerve routes may manifest as sudden testicular pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In our case, the patient’s testicular pain was likely due to the presence of the thrombus in the iliac veins, which can cause venous congestion and swelling in the scrotum. It is important for clinicians to consider IVC thrombosis in the differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with testicular pain, particularly in patients with known risk factors such as hypercoagulable states.\n\n【15】Bedside abdominal ultrasound is a useful tool for evaluating a wide range of conditions in the acute care setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>, but it has limitations and may not always provide a definitive diagnosis. If a bedside abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate for IVC thrombosis and no abnormal findings were detected, there could be several reasons why this occurred.\n\n【16】Firstly, it is possible that the thrombus was located in a segment of the IVC that was not adequately visualized by the ultrasound exam. The sensitivity of ultrasound for detecting IVC thrombosis can be affected by several factors, including the size and location of the thrombus and the quality of the ultrasound equipment and technique used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In addition, if the thrombus is partially or completely occlusive, there may still be some blood flow within the IVC, which can make it more difficult to detect with ultrasound. Imaging studies, including Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans, can help to confirm the diagnosis of IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive and cost-effective way to diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can be a precursor to IVC thrombosis. In this case, Doppler ultrasound revealed DVT extending from the external iliac veins to the distal veins of both legs. CT scans can provide more detailed information about the location and extent of the thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, a CT scan of the abdomen revealed a large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins.\n\n【18】The causes of IVC thrombosis can vary, ranging from hypercoagulable states and tumors to pregnancy and congenital or acquired anomalies in the anatomy of the vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case, the patient was diagnosed with Factor V Leiden syndrome based on genetic testing, which revealed a heterozygous mutation in the F5 gene. Factor V Leiden is a common genetic risk factor for thrombosis, and individuals with this mutation have an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), including IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Treatment for IVC thrombosis typically involves anticoagulation therapy, which can prevent the thrombus from growing and reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The patient in this case was started on low molecular weight heparin and warfarin, and after five days of hospitalization, he was discharged with warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. It is important to note that anticoagulation therapy can increase the risk of bleeding, and careful monitoring is required to ensure that the patient’s INR is within the therapeutic range.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】The presented case highlights the challenge of diagnosing IVC thrombosis due to its nonspecific symptoms and emphasizes the importance of considering this condition in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with back pain, flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain. Laboratory investigations, imaging studies, and genetic testing can aid in the diagnosis of IVC thrombosis and identifying underlying hypercoagulable states. Anticoagulation therapy is the mainstay of treatment, but careful monitoring is required to avoid complications, such as bleeding. Clinicians should consider IVC thrombosis in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with testicular pain, particularly in those with known risk factors. Early recognition and management of IVC thrombosis can prevent life-threatening complications, including pulmonary embolism.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The psychiatry team was consulted, and it was discovered that Ms. A had a previous diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder (DID). Further investigation revealed that her family recently experienced enormous stress, which may have precipitated the current episode. During the psychiatric exam, she calmly sat with her eyes closed and insisted that they were already open when asked to open them. She also repeatedly fluctuated between referring to herself as “I” or “she.” When asked to write a complete sentence during the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam, Ms. A took the pen with her right hand and effortlessly wrote, from the right margin to the left, the mirror image of “I’m tired of being here.” When asked to write the sentence again, she wrote the same sentence in the same direction as fluidly as she had done before . She later reported that she was normally right handed. Ms. A ultimately received a 24/30 on the Mini-Mental State Exam, with points deducted in orientation to place and time and in short-term memory.

Glandular differentiation within these tumors is rare, occurring in approximately 3% of all cardiac myxomas. Its presence can complicate the diagnostic process. A 43-year-old Saudi male was referred with a two-month history of progressively increasing shortness of breath. Cardiovascular examination demonstrated a soft first heart sound with a plopping sound in the mitral area and a mid-diastolic murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large mass attached to the interatrial septum. A diagnosis of cardiac myxoma was made, and the patient underwent en bloc resection of the mass. Microscopic evaluation of the resected mass showed a neoplastic lesion with two components: first, a typical myxoma consisting of stellate and spindle cells in a myxomatous/hemorrhagic background; second, a glandular component consisting of separate, fused, and cribriform acini embedded within the myxomatous component. The acini were lined by a single row of columnar epithelial cells with basal nuclei and apical mucin. Occasional goblet cells were also identified. The postoperative period was uneventful, and on his recent follow-up in the clinic (nine months after the surgery), the patient is doing well with no complications.

Introduction\n\n【3】Cardiac myxoma, a benign heart tumor, is the most common primary tumor of the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although a common entity among cardiac neoplasms, different histological presentations may hinder the diagnostic process. Among these is the presence of glandular differentiation in rare cardiac myxomas. Ever since 1946, when Anderson and Dmytryk first described this change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, only a few cases of “glandular cardiac myxomas” had been reported in the English literature (fewer than fifty) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Herein, we report a case of left atrial myxoma with glandular differentiation, emphasizing its distinction from metastatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 43-year-old Saudi male was referred to the cardiology clinic with a two-month history of progressively increasing shortness of breath. On physical examination, he was anxious and relatively comfortable at rest. The chest was clear. Cardiovascular examination demonstrated a soft first heart sound with a plopping sound in the mitral area and a mid-diastolic murmur.\n\n【6】A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large mass attached to the interatrial septum 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. The mass had a broad stalk, was freely mobile, and protruded into the left ventricle during diastole with almost complete occlusion of the mitral valve 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. A coronary angiogram showed no coronary artery disease.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Transthoracic echocardiogram showing a large mass attached to the interatrial septum (a). The mass has a broad stalk and protrudes into the left ventricle during diastole and almost completely occludes the mitral valve (b).</u>\n\n【8】The patient underwent en bloc resection of the mass, with wide removal of the atrial septum and patch closure with an equine pericardial patch. The anterior mitral leaflet was noticed to have an ulcerated surface. The mass was sent for histopathological examination. The operative procedure and the postoperative period were uneventful. On his recent follow-up in the clinic (nine months after the surgery), the patient is doing well with no complications.\n\n【9】Macroscopically, the specimen consisted of a small fragment of the myocardium (atrial septum) and multiple fragments of gelatinous tan-white tissue, with irregular and friable surface and measuring 7.2 × 4.5 × 1.5 cm in aggregate .\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 A macroscopic picture of the specimen showing the bulk of the tumor consisting of friable gelatinous tan tissue fragments with a papillary surface (on the right) along with the site of attachment (atrial septal myocardium on the left).</u>\n\n【11】Microscopically, hematoxylin and eosin- (H & E-) stained sections showed a neoplastic lesion with two components: first, a typical myxoma, consisting of stellate and spindle cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei (some multinucleated), and mild nuclear polymorphism; second, a glandular component, consisting of single, fused, and cribriform acini lined by a single row of cytologically bland columnar epithelial cells with basal nuclei and apical mucin and occasional goblet cells.

Discussion\n\n【18】Cardiac myxoma, a primary heart tumor, is the most common benign cardiac tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It usually occurs in the atria (especially the left atrium) and presents with variable signs and symptoms ranging from an asymptomatic incidentally found lesion to shortness of breath, systemic embolization, syncope, or even death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–7\\]</u>. These different presentations can be explained by the tumor hemodynamic impact dictated by its location and proximity to heart valves and its propensity to embolize as determined by the texture of the tumor (solid and smooth-surfaced vs. irregular and friable).\n\n【19】Under the microscope, cardiac myxomas with glandular differentiation are composed of two components: first, the typical myxoma, which includes polygonal, spindle, and stellate cells in a myxomatous background; second, acini that are lined by columnar cells with or without pseudostratification; goblets cells could also be identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. The immunohistochemical profile of these acini in the presented case is quite intriguing. It is almost identical to the upper GIT epithelium, showing immunoreactivity for PAN-CK and CK7 while being negative for CK20 and CDX2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Glandular differentiation in cardiac myxoma is well documented in the literature, with fewer than fifty reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9–12\\]</u>. Up to our knowledge, including the presented case, forty-eight cases of glandular cardiac myxoma were reported in the English literature. Actually, glandular tissue is one of the different forms of tissues that can occur in cardiac myxomas, such as hematopoietic tissue, metaplastic bone, or thymic rests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 5, 7\\]</u>. Glandular differentiation, however, is rare in this commonly diagnosed cardiac lesion, encountered in approximately 3% of all cardiac myxomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In a large series studied by Chopra et al. out of 104 cases of cardiac myxoma, only three cases showed a glandular component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Identifying glandular elements in a cardiac myxoma as an integral component of the tumor is of paramount significance due to the resemblance of such elements to gastrointestinal (GIT) epithelium, being composed of acini lined by columnar cells and goblet cells capable of producing mucin just like colonic epithelium. Not only that but also the immunohistochemistry of these acini is almost identical to GIT epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 8\\]</u>. Consequently, the presence of such glandular elements in a location outside the GIT, such as the heart, can lead to misinterpretation of the lesion as a metastatic adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【22】As described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>, the primary differential diagnosis included metastatic adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma arising within cardiac myxoma. The patient was a 43-years-old man with a history of smoking; however, several elements favor the benign nature of glandular elements in this tumor. First, no previous history of malignancy and no evidence of occult tumor was found by radiology (CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis) and negative workup for other primary malignancies (for example, PSA and TTF-1 for carcinomas from prostate and lung, respectively). Second, the gross appearance of the lesion combined with the presence of typical myxoma cells in the background with the absence of necrosis, anaplastic features, mitosis, desmoplasia, and low mitotic index (Ki67 < 10%) of the glands. Third, the immunohistochemical profile is similar to the reported cases of glandular cardiac myxoma in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 8\\]</u>. All of these elements favor the benign nature of the lesion.\n\n【23】Indeed, occurrence in an old patient, a previous history of malignancy, a history of weight loss and anemia (which can occur due to the cardiac myxoma itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>), or the fact that the tumor can be fragile and embolize to different organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> are all factors that may blur the vision of the pathologist about the origin and nature of such a lesion and lead to an erroneous diagnosis of malignancy, especially if the patient had a previous history of adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Acknowledging the difficulty of differentiating glandular elements in cardiac myxoma from metastasis as outlined above, with careful gross and microscopic examination of the lesion, with thorough clinical and radiological workup to exclude malignancy elsewhere, can help to distinguish it from malignancy. The soft, gelatinous gross appearance, along with the absence of significant nuclear atypia, necrosis, mitosis, and desmoplasia, along with the presence of the typical myxoma component, all stand against the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】We report a case of a 43-year-old male diagnosed with cardiac myxoma with glandular differentiation. Up to our knowledge, this is the first case to be reported from Saudi Arabia. Due to the rarity of such a lesion, we emphasize to the pathologist the importance of accurately diagnosing this entity, which can be confused for metastatic adenocarcinoma, especially in patients with a history of malignancy.\n\n【27】#### Abbreviations\n\n| CDX2: | Caudal-type homeobox 2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| CEA: | Carcinoembryonic antigen |\n| CK 7: | Cytokeratin 7 |\n| CK 5/6: | Cytokeratin 5/6 |\n| CK 19: | Cytokeratin 19 |\n| CK 20: | Cytokeratin 20 |\n| CT: | Computerized tomography |\n| EMA: | Epithelial membrane antigen |\n| GIT: | Gastrointestinal |\n| H&E: | Hematoxylin and eosin |\n| PAS: | Periodic acid–Schiff |\n| PSA: | Prostate-specific antigen |\n| TTF-1: | Thyroid transcription factor 1. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We present the case of a 48-year-old male patient on chronic prednisone therapy for rheumatoid arthritis with a history of mitral valve replacement with prosthetic valve. He presented with fever, dizziness, dyspnea on exertion, intermittent chest pain, and palpitations. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed two medium-sized densities along the inner aspect of the sewing ring and one larger density along the atrial surface of the sewing ring consistent with vegetation. Two separate blood cultures grew Corynebacterium propinquum, which were sensitive to ceftriaxone but highly resistant to vancomycin and daptomycin. The patient completed a course of ceftriaxone and repeat TEE study and after 6 weeks demonstrated near complete resolution of the vegetation.

It has been shown to be the pathogenic organism in two cases of native valve infective endocarditis, one in an adult and one in a child with congenital heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. It was also shown to be the causative agent in a handful of respiratory tract infections worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. We present the case of a 48-year-old male with late PVE caused by Corynebacterium propinquum. To our knowledge, this case represents the first in the literature of Corynebacterium propinquum causing prosthetic valve endocarditis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 48-year-old male presented with five to six weeks of dizziness with episodes of subjective fever. Patient also reported having increasing dyspnea on exertion associated with intermittent sharp chest pain, unrelated to exertion, and palpitations lasting 20–30 seconds per episode. Additionally, he complained of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but denied orthopnea, peripheral edema, recent dental work, surgical procedure, or intravenous drug use. He has a significant past medical history of hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis on chronic low dose prednisone therapy, and rheumatic heart disease not on antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient had a mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve 27 years priorly, which was subsequently replaced with a metallic valve 12 years ago. The patient had a pacemaker placed for symptomatic bradycardia 12 years ago.\n\n【6】On admission, the patient was an ill appearing male and was complaining of a dull aching chest pain 4/10 in intensity. Vital signs were significant for fever of 101.6°F (38.6°C). Physical examination revealed tactile fever, clear breath sounds, and metallic S1. Laboratory findings showed a hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, leukocytosis of 17,900/uL with 91% PMNs, INR of 6.1, Troponin-I of 0.534 ng/mL, ESR of 85, and C-reactive protein of 20.70 mg/dL. Patient also had an elevated creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL. Prosthetic valve endocarditis was suspected and the patient received broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin. Vancomycin was changed to daptomycin due to worsening renal function. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 50%. It also showed a mechanical prosthesis in the mitral position with two medium-sized, strand-like, echogenic, highly mobile densities along the inner aspect of the sewing ring and one larger echogenic, spherical density, measuring 9 × 5 mm along the atrial surface of the sewing ring, consistent with vegetation as shown in Figure 1. Two separate blood cultures drawn four hours apart from different sites on the initial day of presentation grew Corynebacterium propinquum. Table 1 shows antimicrobial susceptibility of Corynebacterium propinquum.\n\n【7】Table 1 Minimum inhibitory concentration for Corynebacterium propinquum.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Transesophageal echocardiogram showing prosthetic mitral valve with vegetation (arrow).

Follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram done six weeks later demonstrated near complete resolution of the vegetation shown in Figure 2. Repeat blood cultures drawn at six weeks after starting antibiotic treatment were negative for any growth.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Repeat transesophageal echocardiogram repeated after six weeks of antibiotic treatment showing resolution of the vegetation.

Discussion\n\n【12】The genus Corynebacterium has more than 80 published species of which over 50 can cause occasional or rare infections in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Corynebacterium species are normal colonizers of the skin and mucous membranes and are often dismissed as culture contaminants. It is thought that the incidence of nondiphtheria Corynebacterium is increasing, especially as a cause of nosocomial infections and infections in immunocompromised patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In our case, the patient was on prednisone, which could have contributed to development of infection with Corynebacterium. In recent literature, there have been an increasing number of reports of Corynebacterium species causing prosthetic valve endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Corynebacterium propinquum is primarily isolated from the human respiratory tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It has been shown to be the pathogenic organism in two cases of native valve infective endocarditis, one in an adult and one in a child with congenital heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. It has also been reported as the causative agent in a handful of respiratory tract infections worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. It has also been reported to cause acute nongonococcal urethritis in one patient from Iran 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Corynebacterium propinquum causing prosthetic valve endocarditis. The susceptibility pattern for the strain of C. propinquum from our case showed high resistance to vancomycin and daptomycin, which is unusual for this species. As in other studies, it was susceptible to beta-lactams and an aminoglycoside as well as other antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Due to the rarity of infections caused by this bacteria, it would be premature to make assumptions regarding resistance patterns.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】Corynebacterium species are becoming recognized as an increasing cause of opportunistic infections. In our case, the patient had risk factors of immune suppression as well as a prosthetic valve resulting in this very rare infection. C. propinquum has now been shown to be a cause of not only infective endocarditis but also prosthetic valve endocarditis and nosocomial infections. Physicians should be cognizant of potential serious infections caused by C. propinquum in the correct clinical context.

We, hereby, present the first case of AGEP following treatment with remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19, without hydroxychloroquine use, which serves as a reminder to consider remdesivir as a possible causative agent when dealing with AGEP presentation in COVID patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been well-known for its multisystemic involvement; besides respiratory manifestations, mucocutaneous symptoms have been among the most common presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection can range from erythematous or maculopapular eruptions and urticaria to blisters, petechiae, and livedo reticularis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Skin involvement can occur as the sole manifestation of COVID-19 infection, intervene during the course of infection, or appear after the infection has subsided 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. On the other hand, cutaneous reactions can be a manifestation of a new-onset dermatosis or an exacerbation of an existing condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The underlying cause of this phenomenon can be the virus’s direct invasion into the skin and mucosal surfaces, the immunologic inflammatory response elicited by the virus, or the side effects of therapeutics used in the settings of SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is an exanthematous condition with an abrupt onset, which predominantly occurs as a result of a drug reaction. In fact, other factors such as infections, vaccinations, chemicals contact, and insect bites can also be triggering factors for AGEP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased rate of AGEP has been reported, which could be attributed to the high prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the causative pathogen, or the result of medications used in these settings. Here, we report a case of COVID-19 associated with AGEP with significant diagnostic challenges and complications, and we present a brief literature review.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 62-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a generalized pruritic skin rash. She mentioned a history of SAR-CoV-2 infection one month earlier, for which she had undergone remdesivir treatment. Two days after the completion of treatment, she developed cutaneous reactions beginning in the trunk and extending to the extremities. She also mentioned a history of Addison’s disease, for which she was taking prednisolone and fludrocortisone. On physical examination, widespread pustular eruptions with an erythematous base were covering all of her body surfaces except for the head and the neck area . The hair and nails were intact. No mucosal involvement was detected. She was started on high-dose oral prednisolone and cyclosporine in conjunction with acitretin and topical emollient. A few days later, she returned to the clinic with fever and toxicity. Laboratory evaluation revealed thrombocytopenia and transaminitis. Therefore, we admitted her for further workup. We initially stopped all the drugs she was taking, including cyclosporine and acitretin, and took a skin biopsy.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Generalized pustular eruptions with an erythematous base on the body (b) and extremities (a).</u>\n\n【8】The histopathology report was indicative of linear neutrophilic parakeratosis with mild acanthosis and focal spongiosis, along with scattered necrotic keratinocyte, ectatic capillaries, and perivascular interstitial lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration in the dermis, all compatible with the diagnosis of AGEP . Then, we started her on methylprednisolone pulse and IVIG due to the possibility of idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) in this patient. She was tested negative for COVID-19 and HIV-Ab. The chest CT scan, as was expected, showed diffuse ground-glass opacities in both the lungs compatible with a convalescent pulmonary phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection . Three days after the initiation of intensive therapy, platelet counts increased and liver enzymes decreased. The eruptions rapidly resolved within a few days; therefore, we switched the therapy to intravenous hydrocortisone and then to prednisolone with gradual tapering. At the time of discharge, postpustular desquamation was demonstrated. At follow-up visits, the patient did not describe any relapses.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Neutrophilic parakeratosis with mild acanthosis and focal spongiosis, along with the scattered necrotic keratinocytes, ectatic capillaries, and perivascular interstitial lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration: H&E ×40 (a); H&E ×100 (b).</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Diffuse ground-glass opacities in both the lungs compatible with the convalescent pulmonary phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</u>\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is an acute pustular dermatosis with the abrupt onset of a great number of pustules with edematous and erythematous bases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Several conditions, including infections, vaccination, and medications, have been mentioned as precipitating factors of AGEP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled a wide range of dermatologic disorders, new-onset or flare, in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Therefore, this virus should also be listed among the infectious causes of AGEP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Medications most commonly associated with AGEP include pristinamycin, aminopenicillins, fluoroquinolones, antimalarials, sulfonamides, terbinafine, azoles, protease inhibitors, dapsone, pantoprazole, diltiazem, corticosteroids, azithromycin, NSAIDs, and antiepileptic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Among the common therapeutics used during a SARS-CoV-2 infection with the probability of inducing AGEP, we can name hydroxychloroquine, which is the most notorious medication for inducing AGEP, favipiravir, azithromycin, NSAIDs, protease inhibitors such as lopinavir-ritonavir, anticoagulants, and glucocorticoids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–19\\]</u>. Our patient had received azithromycin, dexamethasone, naproxen, and remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the onset of AGEP could be attributed to any of the mentioned agents, although there has been no definite report of remdesivir-associated AGEP.\n\n【15】In AGEP, the duration of drug exposure before the onset of the symptoms varied from a few hours to a few weeks depending on the causative drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Our case presented with AGEP 4 weeks after receiving COVID treatment, which was a longer latency period compared to AGEP reported in COVID-19 infected patients in the recent literature, which makes it difficult to attribute the AGEP to these medications. However, one can infer that the combination of each of these medications, including remdesivir and genetic disposition with COVID-19 induced cytokine storm, led to the delayed development of AGEP in this case. In fact, AGEP is a hypersensitivity reaction mediated by CD8+/CD4 +T cells. Keratinocyte apoptosis occurs secondary to the migration of drug-specific T cells to the skin via granzyme B and the Fas ligand mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Moreover, interferon-gamma and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factors released by the drug-specific T cells could lead to prolongation of the process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Though AGEP might be considered as an unreported side effect of remdesivir, which has been widely used during the COVID era, it could be merely the result of the resemblance of inflammatory cytokine cascade alterations in the setting of both COVID-19 and AGEP, which let us consider these lesions as some late-onset cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Further reports will shed more light on this issue.\n\n【18】Eliminating the causative trigger, such as ceasing the drug or treating the infection, is the cornerstone of AGEP management. Other potentially useful options include moist dressings and topical antiseptics, systemic antibiotics if superinfection intervenes, and topical or systemic corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. However, in severe or recalcitrant cases, cyclosporine and intravenous immunoglobulin may be beneficial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】We reported a case of AGEP, which might have been triggered by COVID-19 infection itself or be considered as an unreported possible side effect of remdesivir, to emphasize the necessity of paying more attention to history-taking and clinical suspicion as key factors to reaching the correct diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26–31\\]</u>. Furthermore, one can infer from our report that when dealing with skin findings, remdesivir should be kept in mind as a causative agent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This condition poses a latent risk of bed sores. To prevent those complications, we used electroacupuncutre for decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage. A 51-year-old man complained of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticate rigidity. Prior to electroacupuncture, his decorticate rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium and baclofen. However, his rigidity had not improved. This patient received total 41 sessions of electroacupuncture. The patient’s Modified Ashworth’s Scale changed from 4 at baseline to 2 after the treatment, indicating an improvement in the rigidity of the upper limbs. Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale and passive ROM of the elbow joints also improved. We report the observed effects of electroacupuncture for decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage. Further controlled studies are needed to determine whether electroacupuncture is a useful alternative treatment for decorticate rigidity in patients with anoxic brain damage.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】We report a case of decorticated rigidity due to anoxic brain damage that was successfully treated with electro-acupuncture combined with conventional therapeutic options such as muscle relaxants and physical manual therapy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case History\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Patient Characteristics and Diagnosis\n\n【6】A 51-year-old man complaining of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage was admitted to the Department of Cardiovascular and Neurological Diseases of Kyung Hee University Oriental Medicine Hospital. This patient had collapsed during a marathon and had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The doctors recognized acute myocardial infarction (MI) and provided conventional therapies for this condition. However, anoxic brain damage was caused by insufficient blood supply to the brain. He manifested rigidity, dyspnea, and dysphagia. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticate rigidity. Although this patient had underlying hypertension and diabetes mellitus, he and his family had not recognized these conditions until onset of MI. At admission, he revealed GCS score 7 (E4 V0 M3) and used tracheostomy tube, nasogastric tube. The brain computed tomography (CT) image taken at admission  revealed severe cerebral cortical atrophy. Laboratory data did not reveal abnormal values for all items. He was admitted to Kyung Hee University Oriental Medicine Hospital 3 months after onset. Prior to his admission, his decorticate rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium (25 mg) and baclofen (5 mg). However, his rigidity had not improved, and his condition had remained the same since onset.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | The brain computed tomography (CT) image at onset and admission time.

Treatment\n\n【9】Electro-acupuncture was performed as a therapy for symptoms of decorticated rigidity of the upper limbs. Daily electro-acupuncture treatment was performed between 14:00 and 15:00 for 41 consecutive days (PG-306, Japan). The acupoints used in this case were LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4, bilaterally. The following conditions were used: stimulation wave, biphasic (60 Hz); pulse duration, 0.4 ms; and stimulation strength, low. The electrical stimulation power was the same for each treatment (Pulse Generator PG-306, Suzuki Inc. Japan). The patient’s elbow joints and wrists showed mild movement during electro-acupuncture therapy. Each treatment procedure lasted 20 min and was performed by skilled specialists (Korean Medicine Doctor (KMD)) by using stainless steel acupuncture needles (Dongbang Acupuncture Inc. Korea; 40 mm (length) × 0.25 mm (diameter)). Furthermore, Bojungikgitang, a Korean herbal medicine decoction, is administered to control general condition of this patient. There was no change in total daily dose of dantrolene sodium and baclofen before and after electro-acupuncture treatment.\n\n【10】##### 2.3. Evaluation Methods\n\n【11】We used 3 methods to evaluate the effect of electro-acupuncture on the patient’s rigidity: the Modified Ashworth’s Scale (MAS)  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, and the measurement of the passive range of motion (ROM) of the elbow joints.\n\n【12】Table 1 The Modified Ashworth’s Scale for grading spasticity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Table 2 Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【14】##### 2.4. Course of Symptoms\n\n【15】The patient was treated for 41 days, and the results are presented graphically in Figures 1, 2, and 3. The initial MAS score of 4 improved slightly during the procedure: the first improvement in this score (3 points) was observed after the 6th treatment, and a further improvement to 2 points was noted by the time of the 24th treatment. The MAS score remained at 2 points at the last session . The initial Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale score of 3 fell to 2 points after the 6th treatment. Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale score of 1 was noted at the time of the 24th treatment, and this value remained unchanged until the last treatment .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | MAS score changes.

With continuous electro-acupuncture therapy, the passive ROM of both elbow joints improved. Approximately 24 days after initiating treatment, the passive ROM of left elbow joint increased to 180° and the passive ROM of the right elbow joint increased to 90°. The passive ROMs of the left elbow joint and the right elbow joint remained constant at 180° and 90°, respectively, until the last treatment .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Passive ROM changes of both elbow joints.

Abnormal posturing is an involuntary flexion or extension of the arms and legs, indicating severe brain injury. Decorticate rigidity exhibited as flexion of the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs indicates damage in the cerebral hemispheres, the internal capsule, and the thalamus. Our patient’s rigidity was a result of anoxic brain damage due to myocardial infarction.\n\n【22】This patient exhibited flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticated rigidity. This patient was diagnosed with anoxic brain damage on the basis of his medical history, symptoms, and brain imaging. Although he had been treated with conventional therapies for rigidity (muscle relaxants and physical therapy) after diagnosis, his symptoms did not improve before he was admitted to KyungHee University Oriental Medicine Hospital. The patient’s family and caregiver had trouble in moving the patient owing to his severe rigidity. Furthermore, his rigidity made it difficult to change his position for preventing the formation of decubitus ulcers, and this patient was at latent risk of bedsores.\n\n【23】Several studies have shown that electro-acupuncture can treat rigidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. One of these studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> has suggested that high-frequency and low-strength electro-acupuncture on LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 can reduce rigidity of the upper limbs in stroke patients. Because the rigidity of the upper limbs of stroke patients exhibits a flexion, the authors of this study used acupoints LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 to stimulate the arm extensor muscle group, which is an antagonist of the arm flexor muscle group. Although the diagnosis of the present case was anoxic brain damage, we observed a form of rigidity in this patient that was similar to that in stroke patients, namely, flexion of the upper limbs. As mentioned above, conventional therapy did not improve his rigidity. Thus, we used electro-acupuncture therapy based on the previous study in stroke patients (acupoints LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 and a high-frequency/low strength stimulation method (60 Hz, 0.4 ms pulse duration, and low strength)) to relieve our patient’s arm rigidity symptoms.\n\n【24】In the present study, the patient’s upper limb rigidity gradually improved during the follow-up period. The MAS score and Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale improved at both the 6th and 24th sessions. The passive ROM of both elbow joints also improved during the 41 sessions, and notably, the passive ROM of the left elbow joint showed a normal value at the endpoint. Therefore, we believe that electro-acupuncture was effective for treating this patient’s upper limb rigidity.\n\n【25】In general, anoxic brain damage which results in coma causes a vegetative state, and these patients will remain in a vegetative state until death. Therefore, prognosis of anoxic brain damage is very poor. And patients who reveal decorticate rigidity are in a coma or vegetative state and have poor prognoses, with risks for cardiac or respiratory arrest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, in this case, there were improvements in upper limbs rigidity due to anoxic brain damage. Thus, we could make it easy to move a patient and to change the patient’s position to prevent a decubitus ulcer and related complications such as pneumonia. We think that the use of electro-acupuncture for decorticate rigidity not only decreased tone of muscle of upper limbs but also prevented complications.\n\n【26】Baclofen is used to treat rigidity in conventional drug treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. However, patients who have nephropathy cannot use baclofen owing to its toxicity; moreover, a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> has suggested that patients on dialysis are exposed to nephrotoxicity during baclofen intake. Therefore, baclofen cannot be used to treat rigidity in patients who have nephropathy. We believe that electro-acupuncture may be an alternative for treating decorticate rigidity in elderly people undergoing dialysis. In our case, treatment with conventional therapy (drugs and physical therapy) for decorticate rigidity did not result in improvement, but improvement was noted in the rigidity of the upper limbs after treatment with electro-acupuncture. Therefore, we propose that electro-acupuncture is a therapeutic option in patients who show no improvement despite therapy.\n\n【27】A limitation of the present case study is that we could not treat the rigidity of the lower limbs. The patient’s lower limbs exhibited extension, but we could not find any studies in the literature that provided therapeutic methods for lower-limb rigidity. In addition, because the symptoms of the lower limbs were less severe than those of the upper limbs at the time of admission, we concentrated our efforts on treating the rigidity of the upper limbs. Studies that provide data about treating lower-limb rigidity are required in the future. Furthermore, additional research is needed to determine the efficacy of electro-acupuncture on decorticate rigidity.\n\n【28】In summary, 41 days of electro-acupuncture treatment of LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 improved the rigidity of the upper limbs in patients with anoxic brain damage. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions based on a case study of only 1 patient, we propose that further studies would help determine whether electro-acupuncture is a plausible alternative in the treatment of decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in patients with anoxic brain damage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The presence of cardiac metastases, often in the pericardium, besides indicating disseminated oncological disease, represents a diagnostic challenge since they tend to be asymptomatic. Malignant cutaneous melanoma (MCM) is the neoplasm that most often affects the heart. Patients and Methods. The authors describe a case report of a 59-year-old female patient with a history of non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and remitting cutaneous malignant melanoma who underwent skin excision, lymphadenectomy, and adjuvant chemotherapy in 1996. In April 2014, she resorted to emergency service due to epigastric pain and progressive tiredness. Due to the persistence of the complaints, abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed a large pericardial effusion, corroborated later by teleradiography and echocardiography. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, which isolated neoplastic cells. A computed tomography study of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed bilateral and pericardial pleural effusion, as well as alterations suggestive of pericardial and pulmonary metastasis. Later, fine-needle aspiration puncture of the left posterior cervical nodule confirmed histologically malignant melanoma metastasis. Discussion. Given the natural history of melanoma that when metastasized has an overall survival of 15–20% for 5 years, its metastatic spread may occur several years after its surgical excision. Thus, patients with a history of melanoma and heart failure who develop new cardiac symptoms of unknown aetiology should undergo imaging studies such as echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primary cardiac tumours are specific cases, and in adults, the most frequent malignant tumours are angiosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and fibrosarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Regarding benign neoplasms, myxomas and lipomas are the most prevalent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The heart and pericardium are often affected in the context of disseminated metastatic tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–6\\]</u>. Secondary cardiac metastasis is found in 20% of autopsies and approximately 10% of metastatic cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–6\\]</u>. Any cardiac structure may be metastasized, but the epicardium is the preferred site, as described in 75.5% of the cases, and at least half of these are accompanied by pericardial effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. The main forms of neoplastic dissemination are essentially by lymphatic route, hematogenous route, and contiguous extension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The main malignancies with frequent cardiac involvement are the lung and breast cancers, mainly due to their anatomical proximity and high prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 6, 7\\]</u>. Nonepithelial tumours have cardiac involvement in 22.7% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Lymphomas, in the context of secondary immunodeficiency, also present an extensive cardiac involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Cardiac metastases indicate a state of advanced oncological disease, which usually are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. In some cases, they may manifest as arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, pericardial effusion, and acute heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–5\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Cardiac tamponade as the first manifestation of neoplasia is unlikely since, in addition to pericardial infiltration by malignant cells, the presence of other circumstances, such as an acute event or even lymphatic obstruction, is necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 59-year-old female patient presented with a personal history of non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, usually medicated with metformin, perindopril, and simvastatin.\n\n【10】The patient attended to emergency service (ES) due to epigastric pain and feeling of fullness, for which was submitted to dioctyl sulfosuccinate enema and later discharged. Due to the persistence of the complaints and, now, with progressive tiredness, the patient frequented the ES two days later, where she underwent an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed pericardial effusion.\n\n【11】Objectively, on admission, the patient was conscious, oriented, collaborative, eupneic at rest and hemodynamically stable with rhythmic heart tones, no murmurs, decreased vesicular murmur in the right pulmonary base, free and defenceless abdomen, and lower limbs without oedema.\n\n【12】The patient displayed on electrocardiogram a sinus rhythm, 90 bpm heart rate, low amplitude QRS complexes, and nonspecific alterations in ventricular repolarization; chest X-ray was performed with increased cardiothoracic index and bilateral pleural effusion, especially at the base of the right hemithorax; echocardiogram was with large pericardial effusion “swinging heart” and partial collapse of the right heart chambers. The patient is admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit, in the context of cardiac tamponade.\n\n【13】During hospitalization, the patient underwent: pericardiocentesis, with a total drainage of 1250 cc, whose fluid, according to the pathological anatomy, evidenced neoplastic cells. She also underwent a thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography which revealed bilateral pleural effusion, with adjacent parenchymal atelectasis, slight pericardial effusion , and zones on the left side, with clear pericardial thickening suggestive of pericardial metastasis, after intravenous contrast. Several nodules in all lung lobes were indicative of metastases. The patient also underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a cervical nodule, which has shown to be a melanoma metastasis. Later on, it was found out that the patient had malignant melanoma with inguinal ganglion metastasis in 1995 and completed chemotherapy, cutaneous excision, and lymphadenectomy in 1996.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Thoracic computed tomography showing the presence of pericardial effusion.</u>\n\n【15】During hospitalization, the patient had several periods of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, despite chemical cardioversion with amiodarone. The patient was discharged with oral anticoagulation and digoxin, as an effective heart rate management agent.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Melanoma most often affects the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Its cardiac involvement is identified in more than 50% of autopsies, but it is challenging to diagnose since it spreads asymptomatically to the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 7\\]</u>. It is even more difficult to establish the prime diagnosis of melanoma through cardiac metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Once metastasized, the survival rate of patients with stage IV melanoma is very low as their 5-year survival is 15 to 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7, 8\\]</u>. It is metastasized via the hematogenous pathway, by the coronary arteries or the vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. Myocardial and pericardial involvement implies extracardiac metastatic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 7\\]</u>. Like cardiac tamponade, the clinical presentation of metastatic melanoma through cardiac arrhythmia is rare. To date, the arrhythmogenic mechanism of melanoma is unknown. It is admitted that there is intramyocardial invasion with compromise of the right atrium impairing the electrical myocardial conduction system. The maintenance of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented in case may be explained by the electrical myocardial alterations due to melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Pericardiocentesis besides being lifesaving in the context of cardiac tamponade also allows establishing the etiological diagnosis. Treatment in these scenarios is limited to serous sclerosis or the establishment of pericardial windows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】New therapeutic regimens for malignant cutaneous melanoma (MCM)—immunotherapy, BRAF, and MEK inhibitors—demonstrated a significant improvement in relapse-free survival, although they are associated with cardiotoxicity. Among the documented adverse effects, the prolongation of QTc implies a monthly electrocardiographic evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The authors intend to emphasize that given the natural and unpredictable history of melanoma, the patient’s history must be taken into account.

Duodenum injury is extremely rare complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with potentially fatal consequences. Methods. Over the past 13-year period, 3000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed in our institution. Duodenum injury only occurred in one patient recently who had undergone gastrectomy owing to duodenal diverticulum. The diagnosis and management of this rare complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy are described, and the literature is reviewed. Results. We present this case of duodenum injury on the fourth postoperative day after selective laparoscopic cholecystectomy was treated successfully by percutaneous needle aspiration and catheter drainage. The hospital stay was 26 days. No abscess recurred during the follow-up period. Conclusion. Duodenum injuries are extremely rare complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with potentially fatal consequences if not promptly recognized and treated. Sonographically guided percutaneous needle aspiration and catheter drainage can be used to treat the intraperitoneal abscess. Billroth II subtotal gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy were beneficial for the treatment.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has become the standard approach in the treatment of benign gallbladder disease. It may lead to serious complications, some of which can be disastrous if they are not recognized and managed immediately. Duodenum injury is extremely rare complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with potentially fatal consequences. It was commonly unrecognized at the time of procedures and was diagnosed later when the patients experienced sepsis, peritonitis, intraperitoneal abscess, or enterocutaneous fistula. Over the past 13-year period, 3000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed in our institution. Duodenum injury only occurred in one case recently. Herein we present this case of duodenum injury secondary to selective laparoscopic cholecystectomy presenting as fever and abdominal abscess on the fourth postoperative day. He was treated successfully with sonographically guided percutaneous needle aspiration and catheter drainage. The diagnosis and management of this rare complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy are described, and the literature is reviewed.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 74-year-old man with mild right upper quadrant pain for 2 years was admitted to the hospital for acute onset of severe upper abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder. His medical history was remarkable, expect for subtotal gastrectomy 20 years ago owing to diverticulum at duodenal bulb. His vital signs and physical examination were normal. Laboratory data at presentation were as follows: white blood cells 5.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (reference 3.6–9.7 × 10<sup>9</sup>); hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL (reference 12–16); alanine aminotransferase 28 μ/L (reference 0–40); direct bilirubin 4.3 μmol/L (reference 0–8.6); and alkaline phosphatase 63 μ/L (reference 40–150). Abdominal ultrasonography (US) demonstrated one big stone with 2.5 × 1.7 cm in the gallbladder, and the thickness of gallbladder wall was 0.4 cm. No evidence was seen of biliary obstruction.\n\n【6】The patient underwent selective laparoscopic cholecystectomy successfully. The operation lasts for 55 minutes. The patient resumed food intake on postoperative day 2. The temperature was elevated between 37.5°C and 38.6°C from the postoperative day 4. Abdominal Computerized Tomography (CT) demonstrated a cyst-mass in the area of hepatic portal (see Figure 1(a)). Sonographically guided percutaneous needle aspiration was performed. During the course, contrast agent was found to flow into the duodenal stump directly and duodenal stump leakage was confirmed (see Figure 1(b)). Gastrointestinal X-ray showed that contrast agent in stomach flow into jejunum directly and this demonstrated that Billroth II subtotal gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy have been done in this patient (see Figure 1(c)). The catheter drainage was kept. The patient was treated conservatively with fasting and nutritional support for one week. He did not complain of peritonitis and fever after that. And then a liquid diet was taken again. The catheter was closed two weeks later. Abdominal CT demonstrated that the cyst-mass disappeared (see Figure 1(d)). Then the catheter was removed. He was discharged from the institution and the hospital stay was 26 days. There was no abscess recurred during the follow-up period for one year.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) A cyst-mass in the area of hepatic portal pneumonia was seen through abdominal CT.

Discussion\n\n【9】Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the standard treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Growing experience with various laparoscopic techniques and the rapid advance in instrumentation have led to the use of the procedure not only electively but also in complicated gallstone disease or in patients with previous abdominal surgery with extensive adhesiolysis.\n\n【10】Duodenum injuries are extremely rare complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with potentially fatal consequences if not promptly recognized and treated. It was reported more frequently during 1990s when laparoscopic cholecystectomy was at its initial stage. In Marakis GN’s report, 1225 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed and duodenum injury happened in one case (0.08%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Duodenal perforations were usually caused by the improper use of irrigator-aspirator device, or by electrosurgical and laser burns, or compressed by Titanium clips 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Over the past 13-year period, 3000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed in our institution. Duodenum injury only occurred in one patient who had undergone gastrectomy owing to duodenal diverticulum in 2010. The case in our report was asymptomatic during the immediate postoperative period. We had described a presumed conductive burn injury of the posterior second portion of the remaining duodenal diverticulum during retracting the duodenum. However, during dissection in the triangle of Calot, the remaining duodenal bulb diverticulum is at risk for direct contact burn or energy conduction burn. This unrecognized injury resulted in full-thickness necrosis of the thin wall of duodenal bulb with delayed perforation. In order to avoid the electrothermal injury of electrosurgical generator we often use ultrasound scalpel during the laparoscopic surgery. But the special history and anatomical abnormalities should be paid more attention during the operation.\n\n【11】Duodenum injuries are extremely fatal consequences if not promptly recognized and treated. El-Banna et al. reported four duodenal injury cases in 2000, three of them died 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Patients with a perforated duodenum usually present with an acute abdomen pain and more than 95% require emergency operative intervention. Testini et al. reported their experience of managing 5 patients affected by descending duodenal injuries secondary to laparoscopic cholecystectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In all cases an emergency laparotomy was done. Two patients underwent direct suture of the duodenum and external biliary drainage through a T-tube; 1 case underwent a duodenojejunostomy and another duodenopancreatectomy.\n\n【12】In our report, this patient was successfully managed without laparotomy and the total costs of this patient were little more than those with no complications. It was due to the following factors. Firstly, delayed perforation of a duodenum creates a full-thickness hole, but free spillage is prevented by creation of a walled-off area with contiguous organs. The widespread peritonitis was not complained in this patient. Secondly, he has undergone Billroth II subtotal gastrectomy. Oral food does not transit through the duodenum and the healing of the duodenal perforation was not affected. Third, perforation in the duodenal cap had a better result than that at the descending duodenum or the duodenal papilla. And the latter is a more complicated anatomical position which can be affected by pancreatic fluid and bile severely.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Our case was 53-year-old man admitted to emergency department with symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and general fatigue in February 2012. His laboratory findings showed hypercalcemia and thrombocytopenia. CT showed a large multinodular mass in the right lobe and, extending through left lobe of the liver. We considered the diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy with elevated calcium levels and suppressed PTH level with the existence of skeletal bone metastasis and the absence of parathyroid gland pathology. Treatment of hypercalcemia with IV saline, furosemide, and calcitonin improved the patient symptoms. After the 8th day of admission, calcium level, thrombocytopenia, and other symptoms were normalized. Patient was sustained surgically inoperable and transferred to medical oncology department for the purpose of palliative chemotherapy and intended radiotherapy for bone metastasis. Hypercalcemia relapsed 4 weeks after discharge and patient died at the 5th month after admission due to disseminated metastasis.

His past history was unremarkable and he only complained of 20 kilos' weight loss extending over 4 months. Physical examination was unremarkable other than an enlarged liver extending to 5 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory tests showed WBC of 9430 K/μL, hbg of 12.4 g/dL, hct of 36.2%, plt of 2000 K/μL, calcium of 14.9 mg/dL (8.6–10.2), phosphate of 1.8 mg/dL (2.6–4.5), albumin of 3.4 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 295 通用删除7(英):<u>(40–130)</u>, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) of 363 U/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–60)</u>.

Peripheral blood smear staining showed thrombocytopenia. Thorax and abdominal CT, abdominal MRI, and FDG-PET studies were performed. Abdominal USG showed a large tumor with hypoechogen pattern in right lobe of the liver. CT revealed  cm size hypoattenuating multinodular tumor mainly filling the right lobe of the liver with irregular boundaries 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Thorax and brain CT were normal. T1-weighted MR images showed the tumor as a hypointense area and T2-weighted images showed it as a slightly hyperintense area with contrast enhancement of peripheral zone being liable to confluent multiple lesions in right lobe of liver with retrocaval and aortocaval multiple metastatic lymphadenopathy and metastatic lesions on right iliac and right femoral bones 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>.

After the 8th day of treatment, calcium level, thrombocytopenia, and other clinical symptoms were normalized . After the patient stability and normal platelet count were obtained, we performed USG guided trucut liver biopsy. USG guided trucut liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CC.

Medical treatment of hypercalcemia rapidly stabilized the patient consciousness state. In spite of the chemoradiation treatment, disseminated metastasis developed and patient died in the 5th month of diagnosis.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】CC is a rare neoplasm which accounts for approximately 3% of the gastrointestinal cancers worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although surgical resection remains the only curative treatment, most patients with CC are not operable candidates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Hypercalcemia is a serious and frequent complication and a sign of advanced stage of malignant disease, occurring in 10% to 20% of patients with malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It has been estimated to be of 5.3% in patients with HCC and 17.5% in patients with CC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Approximately 85% of patients with cancer and hypercalcemia have metastatic bone disease. The remaining 15% have some other etiology for hypercalcemia as paraneoplastic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HHM) is characterised by elevated calcium, low serum phosphorus, low PTH, and low vitamin D levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The type of hypercalcemia has been associated with the abnormal secretion of various proteins, including PTH-rP by the tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. HHM is usually manifested as certain type of malignancies and is generally associated with squamous-cell carcinomas of esophagus, lung, head, and neck. HHM is rarely seen with CC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The present case had multiple metastatic bone lesions. So, predominantly, these lesions were thought of as the reason for hypercalcemia. And the mechanism of hypercalcemia had no effect on treatment of our case, so we did not need to differentiate etiology of hypercalcemia.\n\n【13】Medical treatment of hypercalcemia is composed of IV hydration with saline, loop diuretics, and antiresorptive agents such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Thrombocytopenia in these cases may occur for many reasons and can be seen in some liver tumors like angiosarcomas and hemangiomas. The relationship between hypercalcemia and thrombocytopenia is not clear but in literature it is stated that there is correlation between hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia also impairs granulocyte function by interfering with ATP synthesis, increasing platelet diameter, and shortening platelet survival so it triggers the marked platelet disappearence. And these lead to thrombocytopenia and reactive megakaryocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In this case thrombocyte level was as low as 2000 K/μL. But there was not any spontaneous bleeding. So we did not need transfusion. The patient was treated with IV saline, diuretics, and calcitonin.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【16】We presented a case of metastatic CC with symptomatic hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and low platelet count. With increased calcium levels and suppressed PTH with existence of metastatic bone disease clinician should recognize this rare presentation of CC.

Idiopathic acquired leukonychia is a rare chromatic disorder of the nail not associated with other abnormalities and discernible etiology. Our case report did not link the inheritance of leukonychia with diverse clinical syndromes. To our knowledge, only five cases of idiopathic, acquired, true total leukonychia were found in literature. This case was the sixth patient with asymptomatic idiopathic, white fingernails, and toenails without a hereditary cause.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Leukonychia refers to whiteness of the nails which can occur either in patches or involving the entire nail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The condition can be either true leukonychia, with involvement of the nail plate, or pseudoleukonychia, caused by subungual and nailbed abnormalities.\n\n【4】Leukonychia may be acquired or inherited. Acquired leukonychia is frequently associated with trauma, drugs such as chemotherapeutic agents, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> systemic or local infections—such as typhoid fever, hepatic cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis or leprosy, hypocalcaemia, and, very commonly, minor trauma. True leukonychia can be inherited as an isolated condition or as one of several other reported syndromes. There are a number of autosomal, dominantly inherited leukonychia syndromes, including leukonychia totalis, in which leukonychia occurs in combination with kidney stone and sebaceous cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>, as well as leukonychia, with sensory-neural deafness and knuckle pads, known as the Bart-Pumphrey syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u> .\n\n【5】Table 1 Classification of true leukonychia.\n\n【6】Classification of the so-called true leukonychia may also be based on the distribution of white blotches, known as leukonychia punctata, leukonychia striata, leukonychia partialis, or leukonychia totalis. Idiopathic true leukonychia is a much rarer condition, with only a few reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–11\\]</u> cases. The following is the case history of a man with persistent, progressive idiopathic leukonychia.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】The 34-year-old male patient was admitted in the Department of Dermatology, University of Palermo (Italy), complaining of color changes on the nails. The symptoms were observed synchronously and had apparently been present for 11 years. When the patient was 23, he developed simultaneous leuconychia partialis of both the fingers and toenails. There was no evidence of atopy, lichen planus, alopecia areata, or psoriasis.\n\n【9】The patient was without a previous medical history. He reported not having taken any drug specific and not to be exposed to chemical agents. He also had no peripheral neurovascular disorders. On examination, striata and total leukonychia of all twenty nails was found . Further clinical examination revealed soft nails with slow growth, without other cutaneous or visceral abnormalities.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a)-(b) Both hands had opaque nail plates characteristic of leukonychia totalis. (c)-(d) The patient toenails exhibited leukonychia totalis and partialis. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】A progression over the years from leuconychia partialis to leuconychia totalis was demonstrated. On examination, the patient had no central nervous system, eye, ear, hair, teeth, or skin abnormalities.\n\n【12】There was no family history of nail disease, the patient was born to nonconsanguineous parents and had two older siblings, a brother and sister, without any features of the disease. There was no family history of atopy, psoriasis, lichen planus, alopecia areata, or any other illnesses. Repeated potassium hydroxide preparations and fungal cultures of the white nails were negative.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Leukonychia is a whitening of the nail plate. It was first described by Mees in 1919, as an associated finding in arsenic intoxication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The physiologic mechanism leading to this phenomenon is not entirely clear. According to Newton's theorem, a surface appears white when it reflects the radiation of visible light. This mechanism can be proposed in explaining leukonychia. Because true leuconychia is thought to be due to abnormal matrix keratinization, with persistent parakeratosis and keratohyaline granules in the nail plate, parakeratosis and dissociation of the keratin bundles may play a role in the modification of the solar light reflection by the ungueal plates.\n\n【16】Several studies have provided evidence for the association of total leukonychia with diverse clinical syndromes, including leukonychia with palmoplantar keratoderma and atrophic fibrosis, pili torti 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, congenital hypoparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, onychorrhexis, and cataracts and the LEOPARD syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Total leukonychia has also been associated with peptic ulcer disease and cholelithiasis as well as with keratoderma and hypotrichosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Our case report did not link the inheritance of leukonychia with any of the above-mentioned syndromes.

Case Description\n\n【5】A 78-year-old woman with no remarkable medical history presented with diplopia, left ptosis, and back pain that has persisted for over one month. Her ocular motility improved spontaneously, but 3 months later, fever, polyuria, and polydipsia appeared. Her body temperature rose to between 38° and 39°C every night. Her urinary volume was 4-5 L/day. There was no weight loss or neurological abnormality. So she went to general hospital and performed brain and thoracic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. These images showed double lesion at sellar region and Th3 vertebral body. Then, she was admitted to our hospital.\n\n【6】Laboratory studies showed anemia and a slight elevation of the serum levels of inflammatory markers. Hemoglobin was 10.3 g/dL (normal, 12.0–16.0). C-reactive protein (CRP) was 4.09 g/mL (normal, <5 mg/dL), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 20 mm/hr (normal, <3–15 mm/hr). The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was also high at 535 U/I (normal, 124.0–232.0). The patient’s basal levels of anterior pituitary hormones were almost within normal range. Diabetes insipidus was suspected based on the clinical findings. The markers of infections, such as HIV, HBV, and HCV, were all negative. The level of serum interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was examined because of detected multiple lesions, and it increased to 7526 U/mL (normal, 190–650).\n\n【7】MR imaging of the brain revealed an intra- and parasellar mass lesion extending to the upper clivus, sphenoid sinus, and right cavernous sinus. The intrasellar mass compressed the pituitary gland to the dorsal side. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted images, iso- to hypointense on T2-weighted images, and inhomogeneously enhancing after contrast injection 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a)–1(f))</u>. No other brain lesion was found. Thoracic MR imaging revealed a mass lesion with compression fracture of the Th3 vertebral body. It was isointense on T1- and T2-weighted images and homogeneously enhancing 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(g))</u>. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging showed abnormal accumulations in the parasellar lesion and the C6 and Th3 vertebrae. Another workup had been done in a different hospital 2 weeks before the patient’s admission at our facility, including computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis and bone scintigraphy; these were all negative. The preoperative differential diagnosis was metastatic tumor, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, or skull base sarcoma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a)–(f): Sagittal and coronal T1- ((a), (d)), T2- ((b), (e)), and Gd-enhanced T1-weighted ((c), (f)) MRI of the brain show a parasellar mass lesion.

The histological examination revealed hyperplastic tumor cells with a high mitotic index. Immunohistochemically, CD20 (a B-cell marker) was positive, CD3 (a T-cell marker) was negative, and the MIB-1 index was 100%. These findings were consistent with a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The bone marrow aspiration revealed positive lymphoma cells. A lumbar puncture showed no tumor cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. Another CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was performed, confirming the presence of hepatosplenomegaly, which seemed to be the consequence of infiltration of the tumor cells. Based on the results of the bone marrow aspiration and CT findings, this patient was diagnosed as having SPL.\n\n【10】Postoperatively, the patient underwent five courses of chemotherapy with the R-THP-CVP regimen (rituximab, pirarubicin, doxorubicin, hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide hydrate, vindesine sulfate, and prednisolone). It took three weeks for one course of chemotherapy. After this chemotherapy, the follow-up MR imaging demonstrated a significant interval decrease in the size of the suprasellar and vertebral masses . Bone marrow aspiration revealed no infiltration. The serum levels of LDH and sIL-2R were decreased (LDH 156, sIL-2R 1063). She was discharged from our hospital after 4 months from operation. After discharge from our hospital, she received one more course of chemotherapy in another hospital. The patient no longer presented with fever. Her diabetes insipidus is well controlled with DDAVP.

Discussion\n\n【13】To our knowledge, only 19 cases of PPL and 16 cases of SPL have been reported. In these reports, several examinations including whole-body CT, gastrofiberscopy, bone marrow aspiration, and lumbar puncture were recommended to rule out another systemic lesion when a patient has PPL or SPL. This process is also important to differentiate between PPL and SPL. The clinical and radiological features of reported PPL and SPL are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The mean age of the patients with PPL and SPL is almost the same. Male preponderance is apparent in the reported patients with PPL or SPL. Histologically, monoclonal B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas are the majority of PPLs and SPLs, similar to primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 10\\]</u>. There is little difference in clinical presentation between PPL and SPL. Although the most common presentation is a pituitary insufficiency in both of these lymphomas, hypopituitarism is seen more often in PPL (73.7%) than SPL (41.2%), but there is no statistically significant difference. On the other hand, the frequency of diabetes insipidus is the same in both patient populations (PPL 36.8%, SPL 47.0%). Symptoms of fever, night sweat, and weight loss are more common in SPL (58.8%) than PPL (42.1%). These are the factors of unfavorable prognosis in CNS lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, patients with SPL tend to have longer overall survival than patients with PPL.\n\n【14】Table 1 Clinical summary of 19 patients with PPL.\n\n【15】Table 2 Clinical summary of 17 patients with SPL.\n\n【16】Unfortunately, regardless of PPL or SPL, the differential diagnosis is usually difficult, although prompt diagnosis and the initiation of treatment are crucial to achieve better clinical prognoses in patients with malignant lymphomas. The characteristic findings in MR imaging of pituitary lymphomas are isointense on T1-weighted images and iso- to hypointense on T2-weighted images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 8, 31\\]</u> and homogeneous enhancement after Gd administration. Hyperintensity on diffusion weighted images is also typical, which reflects the hypercellular density of these tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, these radiological findings are not specific for pituitary lymphoma.\n\n【17】Aside from radiological findings, it is well known that the levels of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) are elevated in patients with malignant lymphoma. However, there is only one reported case of systemic pituitary lymphoma in which the sIL-2R level was measured and elevated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. In our patient, the sIL-2R level was remarkably elevated, and it reminded us of a pituitary lymphoma. Of course, elevated sIL-2R is not a specific finding of malignant lymphoma; sIL-2R is also elevated in cases of autoimmune (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and other malignant diseases. Further, sIL-2R does not elevate in all cases of malignant lymphoma. Despite these limitations, elevated sIL-2R in a patient with a pituitary lesion can be a clue to the diagnosis of this rare disease. Although transsphenoidal biopsy is necessary in most cases to diagnose a pituitary lymphoma, these radiological and serological findings can contribute to a prompt diagnosis and induction of therapy.\n\n【18】For the treatment of primary CNS lymphomas, chemotherapy with the combined use of　a cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) regimen, methotrexate (MTx), and/or rituximab has been commonly performed, but over the past decade, high-dose MTx therapy has become more common because of its penetrative tendency through the blood-brain barrier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, there are multiple reported cases treated with MTx (including intrathecal MTx), and the SPL patients did not have good outcome regardless of MTx treatment. Thus, it is also important to differentiate PPL from SPL when choosing a chemotherapy regimen. In the present SPL case, high-dose MTx was avoided, and a modified CHOP regimen and rituximab (R-THP-CVP) were used. With this chemotherapy, complete remission was achieved and no recurrence was detected at 47 months after the initial diagnosis.\n\n【19】In conclusion, we have described a case of SPL which was successfully treated with chemotherapy. Transsphenoidal biopsy was required because the differential diagnosis was difficult based on only radiological and clinical findings. However, T2 hypointensity in MR imaging and an elevated sIL-2R level can be useful to diagnose this disease, although these findings are not always specific. Neurosurgeons should be aware of this rare disease in the differential diagnosis of sellar lesion, because prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to achieve better clinical outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Malpositioned central catheters have been reported to induce cardiac tachyarrhythmia in adult populations and there are case reports within the neonatal population. We present a case of a preterm neonate with a preexisting umbilical venous catheter (UVC), who then developed a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). This was initially treated with intravenous adenosine with transient reversion. Catheter migration was subsequently detected, with the UVC tip located within the heart. Upon withdrawal of the UVC and a final dose of adenosine, the arrhythmia permanently resolved. Our literature review confirms that tachyarrhythmia is a rare but recognised neonatal complication of malpositioned central venous catheters. We recommend the immediate investigation of central catheter position when managing neonatal tachyarrhythmia, as catheter repositioning is an essential aspect of management.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Obtaining central venous access, often via an umbilical venous catheter (UVC), is a common aspect of modern NICU care and allows for the reliable administration of fluid, nutrition, and essential medications to unwell neonates. Despite these benefits, complications can occur, often related to malposition, extravasation, and/or thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Resultant cardiac complications are rare but potentially life threatening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In contrast, tachyarrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), are relatively common in neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, but their occurrence as a complication of central venous access, particularly in association with prematurity, is not often seen or considered.\n\n【4】We present a case of SVT secondary to UVC migration and malposition in a 29-week gestation neonate and review the available literature. We conclude with a suggested approach to the evaluation, management, and prevention of neonatal tachyarrhythmias occurring in the context of central venous access.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 1240 g (50th centile), 29-week gestation male twin (twin 2) was born following a pregnancy complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion (recipient twin). Delivery was via emergency lower segment caesarean section, due to foetal distress. Apgar scores at birth were 2 (1 minute), 6 (5 minutes), and 8 (10 minutes). Initial resuscitation included intubation and ventilation, as well as cardiac compressions for the first 2 minutes because of a sustained heart rate of less than 60 beats/minute. His subsequent management included surfactant administration, empiric antibiotics, caffeine, and conventional mechanical ventilation for 12 hours before being extubated onto Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). In addition, as a routine part of NICU care, a 3.5 French double lumen UVC was inserted to a length of 7 cm. It was noted to be bleeding back easily, and an anterior-posterior (AP) chest X-ray (CXR) confirmed the catheter tip in a satisfactory position at T9, just below the diaphragm; see Figure 1.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Initial postinsertion CXR, showing appropriate UVC placement, just below the diaphragm at T9.</u>\n\n【8】At 30 hours of age, he developed sudden onset tachycardia, with a heart rate of 250–270 beats/minute. He remained well perfused, with no respiratory or haemodynamic compromise. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was 31 mmHg. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was diagnostic for SVT, demonstrating a narrow complex tachycardia with a rate of 259 beats/minute, a normal QTc of 303 ms, absent p-waves, and no flutter waves; see Figure 2.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 ECG demonstrating narrow complex tachycardia; rate: 260 beats/minute.</u>\n\n【10】Vagal manoeuvres were ineffective. Adenosine was then administered starting with a dose of 50 mcg/kg, followed by 100 mcg/kg. Following a third dose (150 mcg/kg) he reverted to sinus rhythm. However, 20 minutes later SVT returned. This sequence (recurrent SVT and then nonsustained response to adenosine) repeated itself twice over the next 45 minutes with subsequent doses of adenosine, given at incrementally increasing doses of 50 mcg/kg to a maximum of 300 mcg/kg. While this was occurring, AP and lateral CXRs were performed to assess the UVC position. These demonstrated migration of the UVC tip into the right atrium; see Figure 3.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 AP and lateral chest and abdomen X-rays taken after onset of SVT. The tip of the catheter is seen to have migrated into the right atrium.</u>\n\n【12】The UVC was pulled back 1 cm under aseptic technique. At this point a final dose of adenosine (300 mcg/kg) was given which resulted in permanent reversion to sinus rhythm.\n\n【13】Throughout these events the infant had no evidence of cardiovascular compromise. His MABP remained stable at 35 mmHg. He however did require a small temporary increase in his oxygen requirement. After 11 weeks he was discharged home without any cardiovascular concerns or sequelae.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】We have described the rare scenario of SVT as a consequence of UVC migration and malposition. While tachyarrhythmias are well recognised as a potential complication of central venous catheters in adults, only scattered case reports exist in the neonatal literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. 16 cases of atrial tachyarrhythmia associated with central venous access in neonates are available to review when combined with our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–12\\]</u>. These are presented in Table 1. Atrial flutter (8/16) and SVT (7/16) are the two common rhythms described. An awareness of this pattern is vital, as atrial flutter in a non-catheter-related context is less common than SVT and thus potentially prone to underrecognition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Promptly and accurately distinguishing the type of arrhythmia is particularly important as treatment differs, with synchronised cardioversion for atrial flutter versus intravenous adenosine for SVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–10, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Table 1 Reported cases of rapid atrial arrhythmias associated with central venous catheters in neonates.\n\n【17】Migration of central venous catheters in neonates is well known in clinical practice but has not been well studied. Both Peripheral Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs) and UVCs are implicated, with a recent case series reporting migration in up to 23% of UVCs at 24 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This migration may occur for a number of reasons, including contraction of the umbilical stump and changes in size of the abdomen (in the case of UVCs); recurrent movement of the affected limb or head; and routine flushing and handling of the catheter by nursing/medical staff. Therefore, correct initial positioning of the catheter tip upon insertion does not preclude the central line as a cause for a subsequent arrhythmia and serial imaging should be considered as a way of confirming catheter tip location. The validation of ultrasound for localisation of catheters tips is a welcome advance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Understanding the potential for catheter migration and subsequent arrhythmia is also important as time to onset varies. While the majority occur at the time of insertion, arrhythmia can occur hours or even days after insertion (in one case, 47 days after insertion) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 9, 11, 12\\]</u>. This is demonstrated by our case, with migration of the catheter tip implicated in SVT onset more than a day after insertion.\n\n【18】There are several proposed mechanisms for arrhythmia induction. It could be that there are premature atrial beats induced when the catheter tip comes into contact with the endocardium, thus triggering an SVT in the presence of an accessory pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Another possible mechanism is that the catheter could cause mechanical distortion of the atria, predisposing to the development of a reentry pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Either way, in the majority of cases catheter tip withdrawal appears important but alone may not induce reversion to sinus rhythm, with medical therapy also usually required. In all cases reported, once the catheter was removed or withdrawn to a satisfactory position ± definitive medical therapy, there were no further recurrences of arrhythmia.\n\n【20】In conclusion, atrial tachyarrhythmia must be added to the range of dangerous complications of central indwelling catheters in the neonates. This report is intended to highlight this complication, raise awareness, and provide a more complete description of this rare adverse event. Confirmation of arrhythmia type (SVT versus atrial flutter) and determining catheter position are critical aspects of acute management. Withdrawal of the catheter to sit outside the heart should occur before cardioversion. This case is also a salient reminder that UVCs can migrate following their initial placement, and consideration should be given to serial catheter imaging as part of a program aimed at reducing catheter-related complications.\n\n【21】#### Competing Interests\n\n【22】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

His thyroid function test confirmed marked hypothyroidism. Severe elevation of serum CK consistent with rhabdomyolysis was noted and an elevated creatinine indicated acute renal impairment. Patient’s condition improved significantly after starting him on thyroid hormone replacement therapy and aggressive hydration. Acute renal impairment with rhabdomyolysis in patients with hypothyroidism is quite rare and we expect that this case report adds to the existing literature on this subject. We also emphasize that thyroid status should be evaluated in patients with unexplained acute renal impairment and presenting with the symptoms of muscle involvement.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The effects of hypothyroidism on the renal function are fairly well established. These effects include histological changes as well as physiological changes. Most notable physiological changes include decrease in renal blood and plasma flow, decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), alterations in water and electrolyte balance especially hyponatremia, and changes in tubular secretory and absorptive capacity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The changes to renal functions are subtle in most patients with hypothyroidism and are often overlooked in clinical setting. Moreover, this association is often inferred when patient’s renal impairment is improved by thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\n【4】Muscle disorders and other muscular manifestations are also common with hypothyroidism. These muscular manifestations may range from mere stiffness, weakness, or elevated creatinine phosphokinase to more serious manifestations such as Hoffman’s syndrome or rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Histological changes in muscles may be observed in hypothyroidism as well. Although the association between muscle disorders and hypothyroidism is well noted, the association of rhabdomyolysis characterized by muscle necrosis and myoglobinuria with hypothyroidism is very rare.\n\n【5】We report the case of a 33-year-old male with hypothyroidism who developed acute renal impairment with rhabdomyolysis. This case report joins the list of the selected few case reports that reported hypothyroid acute renal impairment along with the association of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 33-year-old Caucasian male was transferred to our hospital from outside facility with acute renal impairment. The patient had no significant past medical history other than gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and he was not known to be on any medication. He has history of tobacco use (rubbing and snuffing) for 20 years and drinks 3 cans of beer per week.\n\n【8】Patient presented with the chief complaint of bilateral lower extremities edema and generalized muscle weakness and cramps. These symptoms were noticed two days prior to the admission. Two months prior to the admission, the patient had also complained of tiredness and constipation. He had not been sleeping well at night. He denied being in unusual stress situation. He was also feeling colder than other people around him. Prior to the admission, the patient noted a weight gain of 10 pounds in 2 days. Patient denied any history of seizure, trauma, or fall recently although he mentioned that he had been doing a lot of snow shoveling over the past two weeks before admission.\n\n【9】On presentation, the patient had a body temperature of 36.6°C, pulse of 78 per minute, respiratory rate of 20, and blood pressure of 193/115 mm Hg. The patient was obese with a body mass index of 38.1 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. On physical examination, he was alert and oriented. His conjunctivas were clear and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. An enlarged, rubbery thyroid was palpable. Chest was clear on auscultation bilaterally and S1/S2 was normal with no murmur. Abdomen was soft and nontender. Pitting edema was noted in lower extremities bilaterally with slight muscle tenderness. No evidence of dehydration was found. No lymphadenopathy was noted. No motor or sensory disturbances were noted.\n\n【10】Blood tests showed a creatinine of 1.54 (reference: 0.62–1.27 mg/dL). His GFR was 52 (reference: 59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 13 (reference: 8–26 mg/dL). His CK was 7200 (reference: 48–222 U/L). Sodium was 141 (reference: 136–145 mmol/L), potassium was 4.2 (reference: 3.5–5.1 mmol/L), and chloride was 99 (reference: 96–111 mmol/L). Urine electrolytes were also measured. Fractional excretion of sodium (FE<sub>Na</sub>) was 0.88 pointing towards prerenal cause of renal impairment.\n\n【11】His TSH was 145.7 (reference: 0.3–5.9 lU/mL). TSH with free T4 reflex was 117.13 (reference: 0.3–5.9 μIU/mL) and thyroxine free (free T4) was 0.3 (reference: 0.6–1.1 ng/dL). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody was 150 (reference: 40 IU/mL).\n\n【12】Liver function tests showed an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 148 (reference: 8–48 U/L), alanine transaminase (ALT) of 82 (reference: 7–55 U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 239 (reference: 98–192 U/L). Lipid panel showed cholesterol of 365 (reference: 200 mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of 42 (reference: 39 mg/dL), and triglyceride (TG) of 257 (reference: 150 mg/dL).\n\n【13】White blood cell (WBC) count was 6.9 (reference: 3.5–11 10<sup>3</sup>/μL). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 12 (reference: 0–15 mm/hr). C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.27 (reference: 0.8 mg/dL). B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 20 (reference: 100 pg/mL). Hemoglobin (HGB) was 12.3 (reference: 13.1–17.3 g/dL). Ferritin was 515 (reference: 24–336 ng/mL). Serum iron was 93 (reference: 50–160 μg/dL). Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) was 333 (reference: 260–400 μg/dL). Iron saturation was 28 (reference: 20–50%). Urine analysis was negative for hematuria and proteinuria.\n\n【14】Ultrasound of thyroid showed a small thyroid that was hypoechoic and heterogeneous with diminished vascularity. These findings, although nonspecific, are suggestive of prior episodes of thyroiditis or long standing hypothyroidism. Ultrasound of kidney was unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was within normal limit.\n\n【15】The patient was started on levothyroxine at 125 mcg and aggressive hydration. The patient was initially given IV fluids at a rate of 200 mL/hr for 8 hours in addition to the oral hydration. The fluids were subsequently tapered off. His creatinine decreased to 1.44 mg/dL and his CK decreased to 5409 U/L after a day of treatment. Leg edema and muscle cramps started improving rapidly after a day of treatment. At the time of presentation, the patient was also given IV hydralazine 10 mg to lower his blood pressure. He was subsequently continued on hydralazine 25 mg every six hours to manage his hypertension. Patient’s condition continuously showed improving trend over a 2-day period after which he was discharged.\n\n【16】On follow-up after four months, the patient’s creatinine decreased to 0.9 mg/dL and his GFR was 60 (reference: 59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). His TSH was 0.469 (reference: 0.3–5.9 μlU/mL). TSH with free T4 reflex was 6.22 (reference: 0.3–5.9 μIU/mL). His HGB was 15.3 (reference: 13.1–17.3 g/dL). His AST level was 47 (reference: 8–48 U/L).\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Kidney and thyroid functions are closely interrelated and their interactions have been fairly well established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–9\\]</u>. Thyroid hormones are not only necessary for the growth and development of kidney; they also play a significant role in renal physiology. Hypothyroidism can affect renal hemodynamics and can also induce water and sodium retention leading to hyponatremia. The pathophysiology of renal dysfunction in hypothyroidism is still unclear. Renal impairment with hypothyroidism is thought to be due to reduced cardiac output and increased systemic and renal vasoconstriction leading to reduced renal blood and plasma flow and decreased GFR. Hemodynamic alterations in hypothyroidism, although important, are often subtle and cannot always fully explain the observed renal dysfunction. A study by Den Hollander et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> noted that variations in the blood pressure during thyroid dysfunction are too small to explain the observed changes in renal function. Apart from the effect of hypothyroidism on cardiac output, triiodothyronine (T3) has a direct effect on systemic vascular resistance which can influence renal blood flow directly thus causing renal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Moreover, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels correlate with free T3 and T4 levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, which may affect cardiac output and GFR. Another mechanism that can explain renal dysfunction in hypothyroidism is the influence that thyroid hormones have on tubular secretion of creatinine. Thyroxine (T4) is known to regulate Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>\\-ATPase activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of nephrons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Another important mechanism of renal dysfunction in hypothyroidism is through muscle involvement. Muscle disorders and other muscular manifestations are common with hypothyroidism as creatinine production in muscles is dependent on thyroid status. These muscular manifestations may range from mere stiffness, weakness, or elevated creatinine phosphokinase to more serious manifestations such as Hoffman’s syndrome or rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Acute renal impairment due to rhabdomyolysis induced by hypothyroid state is quite rare and only a handful of case reports are available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–20\\]</u>. This case report adds to this list and presents researchers with adequate data to characterize the rare occurrence of acute renal impairment due to hypothyroidism induced rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【19】Rhabdomyolysis is associated with a wide variety of causes such as seizures, trauma, alcohol and drug abuse, strenuous exercise, drug induced and others. Rhabdomyolysis occurs frequently, but it is usually asymptomatic with abnormalities limited to lab findings. In severe cases, rhabdomyolysis can lead to electrolyte disorders and acute renal failure. There are many factors that can contribute to the development of more severe clinical symptoms in rhabdomyolysis such as hypovolemia, hyperthermia, electrolyte disorders, congenital muscle disorders, and hypothyroidism. As noted before, hypothyroidism is a quite uncommon underlying factor behind rhabdomyolysis that can not only trigger its onset but also affect its severity. In our case, patient’s rhabdomyolysis was triggered by exertion (snow shoveling) and the underlying hypothyroid status exacerbated its severity leading to acute renal impairment. Rhabdomyolysis was evident in our case based on severe elevation of serum CK to 7200 (reference: 48–222 U/L). Although there is no well-established serum CK level at which rhabdomyolysis is pronounced to occur, a concentration of five times the upper limit of the normal value has been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Serum CK levels are also considered to be a predictive measure indicating development of acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>; however, serum CK levels do not correlate with the severity of renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. A creatinine of 1.54 (reference: 0.62–1.27 mg/dL) was noted indicating acute renal impairment. In each of the case reports that reported acute renal failure due to hypothyroidism induced rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–20\\]</u>, improvements were seen in patients after starting thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Cai and Tang 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> reported two patients who also required blood purification. Our patient improved significantly after starting him on thyroid hormone replacement therapy and aggressive hydration.\n\n【20】Our patient had edema in lower extremities bilaterally with slight muscle tenderness. Edema has been associated with thyroid dysfunction as studies suggest that thyroid hormones affect small vessel permeability leading to leakage of albumin from the vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23–25\\]</u>. Decrease in renal plasma flow, GFR, and free water clearance associated with hypothyroidism can also contribute to edema in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Hyponatremia is seen in patients with hypothyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>, but it was not noted in our patient based on normal serum sodium level thus eliminating hyponatremia as the cause of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【21】Hypothyroidism can adversely affect the hematological system and lead to development of anemia. In a study designed to measure the prevalence of anemia in patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism, Mehmet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> found that the frequency of anemia in patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism is statistically more significant than in the healthy control group. They also noted that anemia of chronic disease is the most frequently seen anemia type in patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism. We note that the patient reported here had anemia of chronic disease with elevated Ferritin and normal TIBC with HGB of 12.3. After treatment with levothyroxine, patient’s HGB returned to normal when followed up four months after hospital discharge.\n\n【22】Our patient had an elevated level of TPO antibody indicating chronic autoimmune thyroiditis as the cause of his hypothyroidism. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis has been cited as the most frequent cause of hypothyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【24】In this case report, we report an occurrence of acute renal impairment due to hypothyroidism induced rhabdomyolysis. Acute renal impairment with rhabdomyolysis in patients with hypothyroidism is quite rare and we expect that this case report adds to the existing literature on this subject and provides researchers with adequate data to characterize this disorder further. We also emphasize that thyroid status should be evaluated in patients with unexplained acute renal impairment and presenting with the symptoms of muscle involvement such as myalgia and generalized weakness with minimal exertion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Most common initial presentations for multiple myeloma include generalized fatigue, renal insufficiency, bone pain, and recurrent bacterial infections. We present a case of a healthy 55-year-old man that presented to the emergency department with a three-week history of anorexia and jaundice without any past medical history. Patient’s initial labs were significant for hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver function enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT). Additional laboratory workup was significant for mild hypercalcemia and increased protein gap. MRI and ERCP suggested primary sclerosing cholangitis but were not diagnostic. Liver biopsy illustrated plasma-cell infiltration and bone marrow biopsy diagnosed multiple myeloma with extramedullary disease. Patient was started on dexamethasone, bortezomib, and cyclophosphamide, but, despite this aggressive regimen, the patient continued to decline. We take this opportunity to present this atypical presentation of a common hematological malignancy and review the associated literature.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Multiple myeloma accounts for one percent of human cancers, almost two percent of cancer deaths, and 12–15% of all hematological cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder that involves clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in bone marrow, monoclonal protein in the blood or urine, and involved organs. Myeloma is thought to arise from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined clinical significance that progresses to smoldering myeloma and, finally, to symptomatic myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Genetic abnormalities change the expression of adhesion molecules on myeloma cells that allows malignant cells to escape regulatory mechanisms and proliferate autonomously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The diagnosis requires presence of 30% monoclonal bone marrow plasma cells and most common initial presentations include anemia (73%), bony lesions (80%), and renal impairment (20–40%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although multiple myeloma is a malignancy that predominantly affects bone marrow and bone, involvement of extraosseous tissues like spleen and liver is a relatively frequent postmortem finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. The reported incidence of liver involvement in myeloma has been reported to be in the range of 26% to 46% in autopsy studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the incidence of premortem clinical manifestations like hepatomegaly or ascites is much lower. Jaundice is an exceptionally rare way of presentation for myeloma and can be due to several causes: postobstructive to infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. We report a case of a 55-year-old man who presented with jaundice and abdominal pain as the initial clinical manifestations of multiple myeloma.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 55-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with a three-week history of jaundice, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and bloody stools. He also complained of generalized fatigue and anorexia for the previous two months. He denied history of heavy alcohol use, liver disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. He also denied history of allergies and was not on any medication at home. On physical examination he was afebrile and icteric, but there were no other stigmata of chronic liver disease. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were normal. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 7.4 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L with plasma cells noted on the peripheral blood smear, hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 95 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, total bilirubin of 10 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 218 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 96 IU/L, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 47 IU/L. His total protein was 7.7 g/dL, albumin level was 2.4 g/dL, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 82 mm/hour. Prothrombin time (14.1 sec) and INR (1.1) were normal. Serum creatinine was also normal (0.9 mg/dL), but his corrected calcium was elevated at 11.2 mg/dL. HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C antibodies and autoimmune antibodies were negative.\n\n【7】Chest radiography did not demonstrate any focal pulmonary or bony abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasound was significant for hepatosplenomegaly, contracted gallbladder, and hepatic steatosis. Due to patient’s persistent increase in total bilirubin, abdominal MRI was done to evaluate hepatobiliary pathology. Abdominal MRI did not reveal any sign of hepatocellular carcinoma but suggested a chronic intrinsic liver disease with possible sclerosing cholangitic etiology due to presence of focal segmental dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts at the junction of segments IVa and VIII and beading of the right intrahepatic bile duct .\n\n【8】Subsequently, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and colonoscopy to rule out primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease. EGD revealed Grade I esophageal varices with normal gastric and duodenal mucosa. ERCP was significant for small intrahepatic ducts with pruning without any obvious beading or ductal stones/debris . Furthermore, colonoscopy was negative for any sign of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【9】Lastly, the patient underwent liver biopsy which identified neoplastic plasma cells filling the sinusoids of the liver and a bone marrow biopsy that was diagnostic for multiple myeloma (90% kappa light chain restricted plasma cells with 95% cellularity). Serum protein electrophoresis showed a monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Immunoglobulin quantification was IgA 2112 mg/dL, IgG 225 mg/dL, and IgM 21 mg/dL. Flow cytometry revealed predominantly kappa light chains (11.1) in serum along with lambda light chain of 0.62, kappa/lambda ratio of 17.9, urine M-spike of 2.3, LDH 725, and B2-microglobulin 7.54. FISH analysis was significant for gain of 1q21, t(4; 14), 通用删除11(英):<u>(p16; q32)</u>, gain of 15q22, and 17p13 deletion. His disease stage was III according to the International Staging System for multiple myeloma. Upon diagnosis, the patient was started on dexamethasone, bortezomib, and cyclophosphamide; however, his condition continued to deteriorate rapidly with persistent rise in bilirubin, ALP, AST, and ALT. Unfortunately, after three cycles of chemotherapy the patient developed septic shock with encephalopathy and died two weeks later.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Patients with multiple myeloma present mostly with complaints of generalized fatigue, recurrent bacterial infection, weight loss, hematuria, or back pain but rarely of jaundice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 11\\]</u>. The neoplastic plasma cells in multiple myeloma produce monoclonal light chains that frequently deposit in kidney, heart, peripheral nerves, and liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although liver is the second most common organ after kidney to be affected by light chains, most of the patients remain asymptomatic and have mild elevations of liver enzymes early in the disease process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Myeloma presenting as jaundice has been reported in literature but the majority of these cases have been due to hepatic amyloid deposition or extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction secondary to abdominal plasmacytoma or pancreatic head myeloma; few cases of liver dysfunction due to plasma-cell infiltration have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Our patient presented with complaints of anorexia and jaundice without any complaints of back/bone pain, hematuria, or renal failure. Diagnosis was not immediately obvious as patient had severe cholestasis with MRI and ERCP findings suggestive of primary sclerosing cholangitis .\n\n【13】Our case is unique as it highlights a rare presentation for multiple myeloma as obstructive jaundice. Patient denied any symptoms suggestive of multiple myeloma. Admission labs did not reveal anemia or renal insufficiency but were significant for thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, mild hypercalcemia, and increased protein gap. Abdominal MRI and ERCP were suggestive of sclerosing cholangitic etiology. Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in patients with liver disease and increased protein gap can be seen in several diseases ranging from autoimmune to infectious ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Furthermore, primary sclerosing cholangitis may manifest with IgM hypergammaglobulinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Since ERCP was nondiagnostic, liver biopsy was obtained  that led to bone marrow biopsy and, ultimately, to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Though the patient was diagnosed in a timely manner, after presentation, chemotherapy course did not alter the course of disease. With extensive extramedullary disease, our patient did not respond favorably to chemotherapy regimen and continued to deteriorate clinically. The patient developed septic shock with encephalopathy and died two weeks later.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 High power image of liver demonstrating sinusoids packed with atypical plasma cells.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Kappa light chain restriction of the intrasinusoidal plasma cells.</u>\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Positive Staining of intrasinusoidal plasma cells for CD138.</u>\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 ERCP showing pruning of the biliary tree.</u>\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 MRCP significant for right intrahepatic beading.</u>\n\n【19】Incidence of extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma ranges from 7% to 20% on initial presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 10, 15, 16\\]</u>. Most common site for extramedullary disease on diagnosis appears to be skin/soft tissues; however, on follow-up liver seems to be involved more than any other organ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 15, 16\\]</u>. Overall, patients with extramedullary disease tend to have more aggressive disease course, with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Once liver failure is established the prognosis is poor and patient progresses rapidly through jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Though current novel agents have increased overall survival of patients to more than ten years, the biologic and genetic features of multiple myeloma play a crucial role in treatment. Patients with high risk chromosomal aberrations and extramedullary disease, like our patient, have poor prognosis. The current diagnostic criteria and staging method for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients are listed as below.\n\n【20】Diagnostic Criteria and Staging System for Multiple Myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>\n\n【21】Diagnostic Criteria. They include at least 10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells, serum, or urinary monoclonal protein.\n\n【22】Myeloma-related organ dysfunction (CRAB criteria) is as follows: hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL (2.88 mmol/liter)); renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL (177 umol/liter)); anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or >2 g/dL below the lower limit of the normal range); bone disease (lytic lesions, severe osteopenia, or pathologic fracture).\n\n【23】Staging. The International Staging System is as follows: Stage I: serum B2-microglobulin < 3.5 mg/liter, serum albumin > 3.5 g/dL; Stage II: serum B2-microglobulin < 3.5 mg/liter plus serum albumin <3.5 g/dL or serum B2-microglobulin 3.5 to <5.5 mg/liter regardless of serum albumin level; Stage III: serum B2-microglobulin > 5.5 mg/liter.\n\n【24】Soft-tissue plasmacytomas in multiple myeloma can arise either through direct extension from skeletal tumors or via hematogenous metastatic spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. It is hypothesized that extramedullary spread may be due to decreased expression of adhesion molecules allowing plasma cells to escape bone marrow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Liver infiltration by plasma cells seems to manifest in two distinct patterns: diffuse (sinusoidal, portal, or mixed) and nodular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>; however, the origin of plasma cells in liver is obscure. These cells could be from bone marrow or may have originated and proliferated locally from the reticuloendothelial sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Only observational data are available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Myeloma patients generally have elevated liver enzymes, especially alkaline phosphatase due to heavy plasmacytic infiltration of hepatic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, elevations of liver enzymes do not correlate with the presence of histologic lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Observational studies have shown higher LDH, ALP, CRP, and IL-6 levels with extensive liver involvement in patients with multiple myeloma. However, one cannot simply hold multiple myeloma accountable for elevated liver enzymes in patients with multiple myeloma. The risk of liver dysfunction due to fatty infiltration, hepatocellular necrosis, hemosiderosis, or granulomata is not more increased in multiple myeloma than any other hematological disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Current research is actively exploring genetic abnormalities involved in extramedullary disease as it is associated with decreased overall survival and absence of novel agents specifically for extramedullary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Certain translocations, t(14; 16) and t(14; 20), along with mutations of k-ras and deletions of 17p have already been linked with extramedullary disease involvement. Hopefully, with gene expression profiling, specific extramedullary disease genes can be identified that could become target for treatment modality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Currently, management guidelines do not revolve around extramedullary disease but are circled mostly around the age of the patient and disease activity. Patients under 65 years of age with active disease are started immediately on induction therapy with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or bortezomib plus hematopoietic stem-cell transplant. Patients between 65 and 75 years of age, based on comorbidities, are considered for reduced-dose intensity autologous transplantation. However, patients older than 75 years are rarely considered for stem-cell transplant and therapy dosage is usually reduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Special stains, such as Grocott’s methenamine silver (GMS) or periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), bind specifically to fungal components and can thus help to more definitively rule out pseudofungi.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】An elderly Black male with ER+/PR+/HER2 negative, stage IIIB cT4N2M0 invasive ductal carcinoma presented to the Emergency Department with bleeding from the left breast for several days due to fungating breast cancer. A complete blood count revealed anemia (hemoglobin, 9.3 g/dL), 578,000 platelets/uL, and normal total white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts. The patient was on anticoagulation therapy with 15 mg twice-daily rivaroxaban after being diagnosed twenty days prior with a bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) resulting in lung infarcts in the right middle and left lower lobes. These events followed a recent history of COVID-19 infection causing bilateral interstitial pneumonia complicated by sepsis, treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. This acute infectious history resulted in a 3-week delay of the patient’s neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel. Due to concerns for disease progression with further delay, he was referred for surgical management. The patient received a left-modified radical mastectomy with partial excision of the pectoralis major muscle and axillary lymphadenectomy.\n\n【6】Pathology after mastectomy revealed a 15 cm mass fungating through the skin, with papillary architecture and nuclear pleomorphism 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>, and eleven out of twenty-eight lymph nodes were positive for malignant involvement. Additionally, at least twenty lymph nodes demonstrated subcapsular and intrasinusoidal refractile birefringent crystal-like structures. On staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), they were morphologically suggestive of infection with Aspergillus 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. There were no necrotizing granulomas in any lymph nodes; however, there were areas of foreign body giant cell reaction and extensive hemosiderin pigment deposition.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 H&E staining of (a) primary breast carcinoma under high magnification demonstrating papillary architecture and nuclear pleomorphism.

The results of all testing were unremarkable. He was febrile only in one temperature reading during his postsurgical stay, likely due to atelectasis, and the patient denied any other symptoms.\n\n【9】Further evaluation of lymph node blocks using GMS, PAS, and Gram stains was negative for microorganisms. Iron staining, however, demonstrated an abundance of deposition, including the septated hyphae-like structures identified on H&E 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. Initial findings on lymph nodes were thus attributed to pseudofungi. With true mycosis ruled out, antifungals were discontinued, and focus was switched to balancing the patient’s anticoagulation status. In the weeks that followed, the patient remained afebrile, and there were no other signs or symptoms of infection.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】We, hereby, describe a case of pseudofungi in an immunocompromised male with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy until a recent COVID-19 infection. Understanding diagnostic mimickers is an essential component of clinical practice, especially in patients with cancer whose immunocompromised state may contribute towards blunted or atypical disease presentations.

Despite the morphological similarity between true mycosis and pseudofungi, a number of notable differences can be made on histology.

Such an inflammatory response was absent in this case, but thought to potentially be attributed to the patient’s immunocompromised status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Additionally, pseudofungi typically stain yellow-brown on H&E, while hyaline fungi such as Aspergillus are colorless and stain basophilic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The use of additional stains, as performed in this case, can help clarify the diagnostic picture.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare primary neuroendocrine cutaneous tumor, rarely metastasizing to the brain. Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) is a disease predisposing to MCC. According to previous reports, headache and focal neurological deficits suggest disease progression to the brain. We present a patient with MCC whose seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain. Case Presentation. A 62-year-old female patient had a history of CLL. A lesion with the appearance of an atheroma was removed from the right upper arm. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of MCC. She was admitted to the neurology department with her first GM seizure. The cranial MRI/MRA showed bone metastases in the right parietal and both frontal areas, compressing the brain. Flow cytometry of CSF did not reveal metastasis of MCC. Conclusions. The case history of the patient was unique even among the rare cases of MCC with neurological involvement. The seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain. In addition to patient history, clinical presentation and radiological findings enabled a suspected diagnosis of skull metastasis of MCC compressing the brain, causing symptomatic epileptic seizures.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and extremely aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy. Both clinically and histologically, it is difficult to differentiate it from neuroendocrine carcinomas, skin metastasis of small cell lung cancer, small cell malignant melanoma, malignant lymphoma, atypical keratoacanthoma, and leiomyosarcoma. In addition to patient history, clinical and radiological findings as well as immunohistochemistry contribute to a definitive diagnosis. Due to the above reasons, it is a significant challenge for the neurologist to diagnose this very rare and malignant disease in a timely manner which needs rapid treatment to provide a chance of recovery.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】The 62-year-old female patient’s chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) was diagnosed 10 years ago and was nonprogressive following chemotherapy. The only other past medical history of note was laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2006.\n\n【6】A lesion with the appearance of an atheroma was removed from the right upper arm 2 years ago. Histology with immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of MCC, and the patient received combined chemotherapy based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. This was discontinued due to bone marrow depression. The lesion recurred 7 months later and was reoperated. At this time, the patient also had right axillary block dissection due to the local recurrence of MCC and its metastasis to the axillary lymph nodes, confirmed by aspiration cytology, showing metastases from both CLL and MCC in the lymph nodes. Postoperative radiotherapy was performed, but the patient’s condition deteriorated. Progressively, a right axillary soft tissue conglomerate mass infiltrated the right lateral thoracic wall, and pathologic upper mediastinal and parasternal lymph nodes appeared. These all showed metastases from MCC. Chemotherapy following the ECO regimen (epirubicin (E) given weekly in combination with cyclophosphamide (C) and vincristin (O) applied during a 3-week interval) was reinitiated due to clinical progression, and the last chemotherapy session (vincristin) was administered 3 days before the patient was admitted to our Department of Neurology due to her first epileptic seizure (GM). The patient complained about headache during the week before admission.\n\n【7】##### 2.1.

She did not have further epileptic seizures and did not develop any neurological deficit. Metastasis of MCC to the skull (bilateral frontal bones and right parietal bone) was diagnosed based on clinical and radiological presentation and patient history. No histology was performed from the skull mass.\n\n【30】The patient died 3 months later. The cause of death was multiple metastases of MCC.\n\n【31】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【32】MCC is a rare and extremely aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy, presenting as a solitary, painless, thick, livid, and erythematous nodule, mostly on skin areas exposed to sunlight. First, it gives metastases to regional lymph nodes and then to distant organs. MCC is often associated with malignant hematologic diseases, such as CLL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Recently, a polyomavirus was identified, likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of MCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Genetic instability and impaired immune defence due to the primary malignancy contribute to the development of other solid tumors, which may explain the coexistence of MCC with CLL. In addition to conventional radiochemotherapy, novel therapeutic options include treatment with somatostatin analogues in neuroendocrine tumors expressing somatostatin receptors, monoclonal antibody therapy in tumors expressing CD56 antigens, and anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy.\n\n【33】The case history of our patient is unique even among rare cases of MCC giving metastases to the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u> due to the following factors:通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>She had a history of proven CLL通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>The seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain\n\n【34】In addition to patient history, clinical presentation and radiological findings enabled the suspected diagnosis of skull metastasis of MCC compressing the brain, causing symptomatic epileptic seizures. Bone metastasis from CLL was unlikely, as solitary bone lesions in the context of CLL are believed to result from either Richter’s transformation or metastasis from another primary malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, in this case, from MCC. Therefore, previous oncological diagnoses and imaging are of key importance in clarifying the origins of solitary bone lesions of the skull.\n\n【35】#### Abbreviations\n\n| ADC: | Apparent diffusion coefficient |\n| --- | --- |\n| CLL: | Chronic lymphoid leukemia |\n| CSF: | Cerebrospinal fluid |\n| MCC: | Merkel cell carcinoma. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is typically characterized by the triad of altered mental status, vertical gaze paralysis, and memory impairment, although their symptoms can be highly variable. We describe the case of a young man who came to the emergency department presenting diplopia, speech alteration, and decreased level of consciousness with frequent fluctuations. Baseline computerized tomography was normal, and because of the clinical findings, thrombolysis was performed. Subsequently made magnetic resonance showed a bilateral acute thalamic infarction caused by an obstruction of the Percheron artery. Although Percheron syndrome has been previously described in medical journals, our case is an unusual case in which we could perform an acute intravenous thrombolytic treatment. Besides, it is important for emergency physicians to enclose the Percheron syndrome in the differential diagnosis of coma in young people so that emergent treatments such as thrombolysis can be employed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Thalamic vascularization is complex and varies from person to person. The paramedian or Percheron artery is a rare variant where a single thalamoperforant artery supplies both thalamic nuclei, with variable midbrain irrigation. Bilateral thalamic infarcts are rare, occurring in 0.6% of ischemic strokes and between 4 and 18% of all thalamic infarcts. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】This type of stroke is related to embolic phenomena, and cardioembolism should always be considered as part of its etiology, as well as the discovery of some congenital defects not known previously objectified. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】It is characterized by decreased consciousness, neuropsychological and memory impairment, and vertical gaze palsy. Oculomotor disturbances, hemiplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and movement disorders have also been described. It can mimic other pathological processes including intracranial haemorrhage, infection, and inflammation. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Emergency physicians should be aware of this syndrome so that emergent treatments such as thrombolysis can be employed. However, diagnosis of Percheron artery infarction is often made in the late stage.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【8】A 43-year-old man with migraine as medical history for which he did not take any active pharmacological treatment begins two hours before his arrival in the emergency room with diplopia, speech alteration, and decreased level of consciousness with frequent fluctuations. He denied the consumption of any associated toxics.\n\n【9】The physical examination revealed predominantly femoral right hemiparesis, binocular strabismus with limited convergence and vertical eye movements, nonreactive miotic pupils, and fluctuations in the level of consciousness with a score on the Glasgow Scale that varied between 8 and 10.\n\n【10】Among the complementary tests that were requested, the analyses showed no alterations (including toxic and drug profiles) and the baseline computerized axial tomography (TC) showed no haemorrhage or incipient signs of ischemia .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Baseline computerized axial tomography image without acute changes.</u>\n\n【12】During his stay, the fluctuation in the level of consciousness persists and a right hemiparesis de novo is observed. Suspecting a posterior circulation stroke and in the absence of contraindications, intravenous thrombolysis was performed. The study was completed with the performance of computerized angiography that revealed a bilateral thalamic hypodensity predominantly in the posterior left thalamus (bitalamic infarction, probably Percheron) which was confirmed with the performance of magnetic resonance imaging , where a bilateral acute thalamic infarction compatible with Percheron syndrome is finally observed, appreciating hemorrhagic transformation in the left thalamus.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Magnetic resonance imaging where a bilateral acute thalamic infarction compatible with Percheron syndrome is observed appreciating hemorrhagic transformation in the left thalamus.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Magnetic resonance imaging where we can observe hemorrhagic transformation in the left thalamus of the infarction.</u>\n\n【15】Due to the persistence of the alteration in the level of consciousness, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for neurological control. During his stay in the ICU, the patient fully recovered his level of consciousness, persisting only at discharge a binocular diplopia of less intensity.\n\n【16】The study was completed with a study of autoimmunity, vitamin B12 and folic acid, serologies for brucellosis, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis that did not show any alterations and the performance of a regulated echocardiogram which revealed a patent foramen ovale, without intracardiac thrombosis.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】The artery of Percheron (AOP) is a rare variant of the paramedian arterial supply in which a single dominant thalamoperforating artery nourishes both the paramedian thalamus and, in some cases, the rostral midbrain. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Bilateral thalamic infarcts are rare, occurring in 0.6% of ischemic strokes and between 4 and 18% of all thalamic infarcts. They are typically characterized by the triad of altered mental status, vertical gaze paralysis, and memory impairment, although their symptoms can be highly variable, including aphasia, amnesia, and hypersomnolence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, as happened in our patient, where the fluctuation in the level of consciousness and diplopia were present from the beginning. Furthermore, our patient presented right hemiparesis. As we have seen in some publications such as Arauz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, motor paresis has been described as a frequent symptom and it may be explained by the cortical spinal tract impairment at the midbrain level.\n\n【20】Occlusion of the AOP is not the only condition that can be found in thalamic lesions. We want to highlight the importance of framing a syndrome within the differential diagnosis of altered level of consciousness in young people, among which we find other vascular etiologies such as basilar syndrome and deep cerebral venous thrombosis; pathologies such as Wernicke’s encephalopathy, neoplasms, infections, Wilson’s disease, osmotic myelinolysis, toxic and metabolic processes, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>; which we exclude based on symptoms and above all thanks to the neuroimaging findings.\n\n【21】AOP infarction is an often delayed diagnosis due to various factors. First is a syndrome that is unknown to many emergency physicians due to its rarity, and next, the ultimate diagnosis is typically by magnetic resonance imaging in the hospital course. When we suspect an infarction in the territory of the posterior circulation, it is of vital importance performing a cerebral computerized axial tomography (CT) imaging to exclude hemorrhagic processes and enable adequate treatment with intravenous thrombolysis. Early identification of basilar artery occlusion may allow recanalisation and reperfusion via intravenous and/or intra-arterial thrombolysis. As far as we know, our case is the second case reported along with the one reported by Caruso et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, in which we were able to perform an acute intravenous thrombolysis, often not available because of the delay in the diagnosis. Kostanian and Cramer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> also reported a case in which they performed acute endovascular thrombolytic therapy for the AOP occlusion that showed clinical and imaging improvement after 24 hours.\n\n【22】Patients have frequently missed the time window for acute management of ischemic stroke, most of the times because of the absence of alterations in the baseline imaging and authors reported a low sensitivity of angiographic study, being brain magnetic resonance the most specific imaging test for diagnosis, often based on clinical suspicion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】In conclusion, AOP is an uncommon entity of coma in young patients, being of vital importance for emergency physicians to keep it in the differential diagnosis of coma and altered mental status in young people, in order to exclude other vascular etiologies and metabolic diseases and to establish a treatment for a favorable neurologic outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Melioidosis is a bacterial infection caused by a Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei, prevalent in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Sri Lanka is situated in the endemic belt of melioidosis. Melioidosis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and results in high mortality rates in severe infection. Case Report. We report a 54-year-old previously healthy Sri Lankan farmer who presented with septicemia following a cut injury to the right leg while working in a paddy field. Initially, he had mild wound sepsis, and later, his condition deteriorated rapidly. The patient required organ support later for cardiovascular instability, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and coagulopathy. The patient’s blood culture was negative on the admission day, and the repeated blood culture taken at the ICU was contaminated with a commensal flora initially and later isolated Burkholderia pseudomallei. Although wound swab culture taken on the first day isolated an organism, it took six days to identify it as Burkholderia pseudomallei. The patient succumbed to severe melioidosis leading to a severe sepsis and multiorgan failure in spite of treatment with meropenem. Conclusion. This case report highlights the importance of considering melioidosis as a differential diagnosis when a patient comes with risk factors for melioidosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Melioidosis is an infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei which is a Gram-negative, oxidase-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming motile bacillus that is found in soil and water. Melioidosis is common in the tropical and subtropical zone between 30<sup>°</sup>N and 30<sup>°</sup>S 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Melioidosis is considered as endemic in Sri Lanka.\n\n【4】There are three modes of transmission of this agent. They are inhalation, ingestion, and direct inoculation. Person to person, sexual, perinatal, vertical, and nosocomial transmission have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Clinical presentation of melioidosis infection ranges from an asymptomatic state to rapidly severe sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It also has a chronic and relapsing course and can remain dormant for long periods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Polysaccharide capsule and lipopolysaccharide of the bacteria are resistant to compliment-mediated killing, which increases its virulence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Severe infection is common among people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, renal disease, liver disease, alcohol consumption, and thalassemia. Occupational exposure to surface water and mud in the form of agriculture, farming, fishing, gardening, land surveying, building construction, and manual labouring are risk factors for melioidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. A study conducted in Sri Lanka reported melioidosis in Sri Lanka has wide geographical distribution and it is common in rice-growing rural areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The incubation period of melioidosis varies, usually from 2 to 4 weeks, but can vary from 1 day to a few years. Clinical manifestations of melioidosis are not distinctive. Therefore, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation by isolation of Burkholderia pseudomallei from the clinical specimens. High degree of clinical suspicion is necessary to arrive at a diagnosis and commence treatment early because severe melioidosis is often lethal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【8】This case report highlights the importance of considering melioidosis in high-risk groups of Sri Lanka for early diagnosis and treatment to timely control the sepsis due to melioidosis.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【10】A previously healthy 54-year-old farmer from the Kurunagala district of Sri Lanka presented to our hospital with a history of fever with chills and rigors and a right leg wound following a cut injury and associated painful right leg swelling of 10 days duration. Twelve days back, he had sustained the cut injury from a cutting machine while he was walking in a paddy field. The wound was painful and had pus discharge. Along with fever, he had a painful inguinal lymph node on the right side. He had constitutional symptoms such as loss of appetite and malaise. Other systemic reviews were normal. He had consumed alcohol occasionally, and he was a nonsmoker.\n\n【11】Initially, he was treated by a general practitioner with oral antibiotics, and later, he was given in-ward treatment at a nearby local hospital for five days. At the local hospital, he was treated for febrile wound sepsis with intravenous cefotaxime 1 g 8 hourly and intravenous flucloxacillin 500 mg 6 hourly. Incision and drainage was performed for the wound at the local hospital. Despite the treatment, his symptoms worsened. Due to the lack of response, he got admitted to our hospital.\n\n【12】On the day of admission to our hospital, he was febrile. There was a superficial wound with pus on the anterior aspect of the right leg 5 cm proximal to the ankle joint which was associated with surrounding right-leg cellulitis. There was a tender right inguinal lymph node. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examination findings were normal.\n\n【13】His investigations showed raised white cell count (WBC) (14,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> 88% of neutrophils). The haemoglobin level was 12.4 g/dl, and platelet was 204,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Blood picture showed neutrophil leukocytosis with left shift and toxic changes in neutrophils suggestive of a bacterial infection. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was 173 mg/L. The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) was 18 mm/hour. His liver function and serum creatinine were within normal limits. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed a large right inguinal lymph node without formation of an abscess. Blood culture and urine culture taken on the admission day were negative. A wound swab culture taken on the admission day isolated an organism; however, it took six days to identify the organism as Burkholderia pseudomallei.\n\n【14】Initially, he was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g twice a day. The wound was cleaned and dressed with povidone iodine.\n\n【15】Five days after in-ward treatment in our hospital, his general condition deteriorated. He complained of worsening dry cough and shortness of breath. There was intermittent fever at 99°F, and he complained of reduced urine output. He became tachypnoeic (respiratory rate 25 breaths/minute), dyspnoeic, and tachycardic (pulse rate 144 beats/minute). The systolic blood pressure was 116/60 mmHg. He had bibasal fine and coarse crepitations more on the left side. His oxygen saturation dropped to 93% on room air. There were no audible cardiac murmurs. Abdominal and neurological examination findings were normal. His condition progressively deteriorated out of control. He was taken into an intensive care unit (ICU) on the same day for further management. At the ICU, his condition further deteriorated. He developed type 1 respiratory failure and vasodilatory shock. He was promptly intubated and ventilated and started on inotropes.\n\n【16】On the day of admission to the ICU, all the blood investigations, cultures, and imaging studies were repeated. He had rising WBC (23,000 cell/mm<sup>3)</sup> with neutrophil leukocytosis. Blood picture showed left shift and toxic changes in neutrophils without evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. There was a drastic drop in the platelets (112 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>). His CRP had risen to 420 mg/L, ESR was 20 mm/hour, and serum creatinine had increased to 356 micromoles/l with blood urea 81 mg/dl. He had oliguria. After admitting to the ICU, he was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Intravenous meropenem 1 g 12 hourly was started on day 1 of ICU suspecting possible melioidosis because of his exposure history with soil in the paddy field. A meropenem 1 g 12 hourly drug regime was given considering his acute kidney injury. He was also started on intravenous teicoplanin 400 mg daily to cover Gram-positive microbes and started intravenous metronidazole 500 mg three times a day to cover anaerobes and oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day to cover atypical organisms.\n\n【17】During the ICU stay, after commencing on broad-spectrum antibiotics, his CRP came down to 350 mg/L, but his WBC remained around 15,000–20,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. He had rising serum creatinine and blood urea and developed anuria. The serum lactate level increased up to 8 mmol/L. He had rising AST, ALT, and ALP levels. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and International Normalized Ratio (INR) levels increased rapidly. His acute kidney injury was complicated with hyperkalemia. Creatinine phosphokinase was 94 U/L. The summary of investigation findings on day 01 and during the ICU stay is illustrated in Table 1.\n\n【18】Table 1 Summary of investigation findings on day 01 and during ICU stay.\n\n【19】Chest X-ray showed heterogenous opacifications at lung bases probably due to pulmonary oedema following acute kidney injury and due to associated melioidosis pneumonia . These X-rays features improved slightly while he was in the ICU. Transthoracic echo did not show vegetations. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed increased echogenicity of the kidney due to acute kidney injury.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest X-ray showing heterogenous bilateral, bibasal opacification mainly on the left side.</u>\n\n【21】Repeat blood culture, which was taken on day one of ICU stay, was initially contaminated with Gram-positive Staphylococcus coagulase negative organism which masked the Burkholderia pseudomallei. However, later, it isolated Burkholderia pseudomallei. On the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of ICU stay, the positive blood and wound swab culture reports for Burkholderia pseudomallei were available. Then, the diagnosis of melioidosis with evidence of severe sepsis and multiorgan failure was made. Its sensitivity pattern showed resistance to ceftazidime, tigecycline, colistin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, it was sensitive to meropenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Intravenous meropenem was continued since it is the drug of choice for severe melioidosis.\n\n【22】Furthermore, he developed fast atrial fibrillation. He had progressively worsening acute kidney injury, acute liver failure, and septic shock while in the ICU. He had bleeding from the endotracheal tube and developed melaena due to coagulopathy and low platelet. The patient was on ventilation and with a support of inotropes till the end. He was treated with amiodarone when he developed fast atrial fibrillation. He underwent daily hemodialysis for acute kidney injury but hardly had any improvement. Blood products were given when he developed bleeding to correct coagulopathy and low platelets. However, surprisingly, his right leg wound and cellulitis resolved gradually. Despite all these interventions, he continued to deteriorate. He went into refractory septic shock and multiorgan failure and died on the 7th day of ICU stay. The cause of death was severe melioidosis septicemia with multiorgan failure.\n\n【23】Before positive culture reports were available, we had a few differential diagnoses apart from melioidosis when he was admitted to the ICU. Leptospirosis was one of the differential diagnoses. It is a zoonotic infection in Sri Lanka caused by a spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. Usually, the organism is acquired by direct inoculation on to a past skin abrasion or mucosa from the wet muddy soil such as from the soil in a paddy field. This is characterized by febrile illness, which is complicated with low platelet count, acute kidney injury, pulmonary haemorrhages, and sometimes, acute liver failure. However, our patient’s leptospirosis IgM and IgG antibodies levels measured on the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of the illness were negative. We also thought of osteomyelitis of the right tibia with associated wound sepsis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, blood culture did not show MRSA and X-rays of the right tibia and fibula were normal. Since he had signs of lung infection, we investigated him for COVID-19, but the COVID-19 PCR test was negative. His dengue antibodies were negative. Dengue is an endemic mosquito-born viral disease in Sri Lanka. Venous duplex of the lower limb was performed to exclude deep vein thrombosis, and it only showed right leg subcutaneous oedema. HIV 1 and 2 antibodies were negative.\n\n【24】This case was an example for severe melioidosis sepsis which led to rapid progression leading to multiorgan failure and death.\n\n【25】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【26】Melioidosis is caused by Gram-negative saprophyte, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is a very virulent organism and shows antibiotic resistance. Melioidosis can affect any organ of the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Its presentation ranges from acute to chronic and local to systemic or subclinical infection. If present as septicemia, it can progress to multiorgan failure and death. The mortality rate is high, 90% without effective treatment and 50% even after antibiotic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The study conducted in Sri Lanka using 250 culture-positive melioidosis cases reported from 2006 to 2017 May has shown the mortality was 20.4% in the study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Severe infection is common in patients with diabetes, renal disease, liver disease, alcohol consumption, and thalassemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. People who have exposure to wet soils or water such as farmers, manual labourers, workers of building construction sites, and surveyors or who are involved in gardening and fishing are at a high risk of getting Burkholderia pseudomallei infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This patient, although he was immunocompetent, had occupational exposure. The patient was a previously healthy farmer and recently had a cut injury from a cutting machine while working in a paddy field. Direct inoculation of the organism on the wound via damaged skin from the wet soil and water in the paddy field might be the mode of transmission of the infection. High degree of suspicion of melioidosis is needed when the patient is from an endemic area with a potential exposure history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Melioidosis commonly affects the lungs followed by the skin and subcutaneous tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 11, 12\\]</u>. Skin and soft tissue infection due to melioidosis accounts for 13%–24% of clinical presentations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A study conducted in Sri Lanka has shown that lung infection due to melioidosis predominated followed by musculoskeletal infections, abdominal involvement, and skin and soft tissue involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Local infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue due to melioidosis can progress to bacteremia and severe septicemia as in this patient. Acute kidney injury is also one of the complications seen in severe melioidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Delay in considering melioidosis as a differential diagnosis and delay in initiating proper treatment for melioidosis can contribute to severe melioidosis.\n\n【29】Definitive diagnosis requires identification of Burkholderia pseudomallei in clinical specimens ideally by using Ashdown broth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. Bacterial culture has 100% specificity in diagnosing melioidosis; however, sensitivity has been estimated as low as 60% in one Bayesian model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The manual identification kits and automated microbial identification system generally do not recognize the organism as Burkholderia pseudomallei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore, it is essential to have high degree of suspicion of Burkholderia pseudomallei to look for Gram stain appearance, antibiotic susceptibility pattern, and colony morphology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is also difficult to isolate and identify Burkholderia pseudomallei from a nonsterile site due to scanty growth which is masked by the contamination with commensal flora. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Ashdown’s selective agar or an alternative selective agar is needed in addition to MacConkey and blood agar for primary isolation of Burkholderia pseudomallei from a nonsterile site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Serological investigations play a role when cultures are negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Burkholderia pseudomallei shows resistance to many antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. It is sensitive to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chlorampenicol, 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporin (ceftazidime), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ureidopenicillin, cefoperozone/sulbactam, azithromycin, and carbapenem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This patient’s isolate was resistant to ceftazidime but sensitive to meropenem and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\n\n【31】Current treatment guideline of melioidosis consists of two phases. They are two weeks of intensive therapy (which can be extended for 4 weeks if clinically required) with either intravenous ceftazidime or carbapenem followed by oral eradication therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 3–6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Rapid treatment of septicemia, eradication of the disease, and prevention of relapses are aims of this treatment regime 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Meropenem has some evidence in showing better outcome in severe melioidosis with septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Melioidosis causes significant mortality, morbidity, recurrences, and reinfection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore, early diagnosis and early initiation of correct antibiotic is necessary when managing a patient with melioidosis.\n\n【33】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【34】Melioidosis has a wide range of clinical presentations; therefore, it is necessary that clinicians have high degree of suspicion of melioidosis when a septic patient comes from a relevant geographical area with risk factors. It is important to have early suspicion and definitive diagnosis of melioidosis to start a correct treatment timely. This may reduce the morbidity and mortality in severe melioidosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is an inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland, usually triggered by a recent viral or bacterial infection of upper respiratory tracts. The disease is characterized by neck pain radiating to the ears and thyroid gland tenderness. In most cases, it is associated with a transient episode of hyperthyroidism, which is followed by euthyroidism. However, sometimes, it manifests itself with hypothyroidism. Case Presentation. The present report described a case of SAT who was a 55-year-old man presenting to an endocrine clinic with tachycardia, tremor, and neck pain radiating to the jaw and ears. His thyroid function test revealed thyrotoxicosis, and thyroid ultrasound findings were consistent with SAT. The patient reported a history of COVID-19 about 15 days before presentation, which was confirmed by a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. It is of great importance for physicians to note that thyrotoxicosis in a patient with a recent history of COVID-19 can be due to SAT. Therefore, they should not begin antithyroid drugs without ordering proper investigations.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of a case of pneumonia with unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. Investigations on this case by the Chinese scientists led to the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, 2020, the mentioned disease, which was named as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by the WHO. According to the mentioned organization, 254,256,432 cases of infection, as well as 5,112,461 cases of related mortality, had been reported until November 17, 2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The first clinical findings reported included respiratory symptoms associated with bilateral pulmonary ground-glass lesions on CT scan and radiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Since then, some extrapulmonary manifestations have also been reported as early disease manifestations or related complications, including gastrointestinal, hepatic, biliary, pancreatic, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, and neurological manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Until March 26, 2021, twenty-two cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) were reported that were potentially due to concomitant or recent COVID-19 . However, there were no reports of any associations between the coronavirus infections and SAT before the current pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The present study reported a case of SAT after recent COVID-19.\n\n【4】Table 1 Review of previous post-COVID SAT.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 55-year-old man living in Tehran, Iran, presented to the emergency department with complaints of diffuse neck pain extending to the jaw, severe and frequent coughs, and hot flashes. On clinical examination, the thyroid gland was tender, while the vital signs were normal. The patient reported a recent COVID-19 diagnosed with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 about 15 days before presentation, for which he was treated with favipiravir and corticosteroids (AMP dexamethasone 8 mg daily for 3 days). A thyroid function test (TFT) with the CLIA method was ordered for the patient, which showed elevated T3 and T4 and decreased TSH . The cell blood count (CBC) results were as follows: WBC, 10.4 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l (normal range: 4–10 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>); RBC, 3.95 × 10<sup>12</sup>/l (normal range: 4.6–6.2 10<sup>12</sup>/l); Hb, 11.9 g/dL (normal range: 13–17 g/dL); HCT, 34.5% (normal range: 39–50%); PLT, 432 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l (normal range: 140–400 10<sup>9</sup>/l); and lymphocyte rate, 19% (normal range: 20–45%). Also, the following inflammatory markers were elevated as well: ESR, 121 mm/h (normal range: up to 20 mm/h) and CRP titer, 92.6 mg/l (normal range: <10 mg/l). The thyroid ultrasound revealed a mild diffuse goiter with a focal and ill-defined hypoechoic area, which is a characteristic finding of SAT . The patient denied any history of thyroid diseases or chronic medication use. Stasiak and Lewiński 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> proposed new diagnostic criteria for COVID-19-induced SAT based on the new characteristics of SAT triggered by SARS-CoV-2. We compared the abovementioned criteria  with the clinical findings of our patient, finding that the present case met the criteria for COVID-19-induced SAT, so the patient was diagnosed with SAT induced by COVID-19, for which he received aspirin as the first-line treatment. Following 10 days of treatment, no improvement was observed, and the patient complained of front neck pain while talking. Therefore, prednisolone 25 mg/d was prescribed for the patient. Following three weeks of prednisolone treatment, the symptoms were resolved, and thyroid function tests repeated for the patient indicated that T3, T4, and TSH levels returned to their normal ranges.\n\n【7】Table 2 TFT at multiple time points during the patient illness.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Thyroid ultrasound findings.</u>\n\n【9】Table 3 Comparison the mentioned criteria with the clinical findings of our patient.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】The first report of COVID-19-induced SAT was an 18-year-old woman with symptoms consistent with SAT that was initiated 15 days after an episode of mild COVID-19 diagnosed by a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at that time. The primary symptoms of this patient were the typical symptoms of SAT, including low-grade fever, neck pain, fatigue, and palpitations. Laboratory tests ordered were consistent with SAT and included accelerated ESR, elevated CRP, and thyrotoxicosis in the thyroid function test. Patients underwent corticosteroid therapy, leading to symptom resolution in a few days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. After the publication of the mentioned report, the 2-week interval between COVID-19 and SAT was considered to be relatively short. However, other case reports and case series studies published afterward showed that surprisingly, SAT symptoms could initiate shortly after the beginning of COVID-19. According to the observations, SAT symptoms may develop concomitant with COVID-19 or shortly after, with a maximum interval of 6 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u> . Although neck pain might be attributed to a viral infection, so it is usually underreported, and the prevalence of painless COVID-19-induced SAT is increasing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 21–24\\]</u>. Thus, it seems that neck pain, which was a symptom previously regarded as the key diagnostic criterion, is not always present. However, in our search, only one case of painless SAT was reported as a “case report” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Our patient had a complaint of neck pain. In fact, 3 groups of patients may develop painless COVID-19-induced SAT. The first group includes the patients with COVID-19 who are taking NSAIDs or analgesics due to their COVID-19-related symptoms. Therefore, they may not feel any neck pain due to the analgesic effects of these medications. The second group includes the ICU-admitted patients with COVID-19-induced SAT who cannot feel or express pain due to their condition or strong medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Finally, the third group includes patients with true, painless COVID-19-induced SAT.\n\n【12】Since asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly prevalent, it is recommended to order PCR tests for all patients presenting with SAT symptoms. This painless course may be related to reduced lymphocytic-plasmacytic infiltration in the thyroid gland due to lymphopenia present in COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. In general, few patients with SAT develop the signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. However, a sudden onset of tachycardia, the deterioration of previous tachycardia, and the onset of arrhythmias are the typical symptoms of COVID-19-induced SAT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 19\\]</u>. Thyroid function tests in SAT patients with severe COVID-19 have shown thyrotoxicosis with elevated FT4 and reduced TSH and FT3, which corresponds to the simultaneous presence of SAT and nonthyroidal illness syndrome during the course of severe systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The development of thyroid diseases in the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been associated with various mechanisms of thyroid damage, including excessive immune response, the immunodeficiency associated with infection, or direct cellular damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 27\\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits significant tissue tropism, including high affinity to the thyroid tissue. The key factor in SARS-CoV-2 infection is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which enables viral entry. Thyroid cells are rich in ACE-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 23, 24, 28, 29\\]</u>. According to Rotondi et al. the mRNA encoding the ACE-2 receptor is highly expressed in thyroid follicular cells, making them a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. The highest incidence of SAT has been reported in middle-aged women, and the females account for 75–80% of all SAT cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26, 31\\]</u>. However, the symptoms suggestive of SAT are present in 10% and 20% of ICU-admitted patients with COVID-19 and those hospitalized in non-ICU wards due to this disease, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 23\\]</u>. Moreover, some pediatric cases of SAT have been reported recently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32, 33\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Stasiak et al. showed that the susceptibility to SAT and the chance of recurrent SAT could be related to HLA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34, 35\\]</u>. They performed a study on Caucasian population, reporting that the risk of recurrence was significantly higher in patients with both HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>18 : 01 and HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>35 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Also, they demonstrated that even the ultrasound characteristics of SAT thyroid lesions were related to HLA, with HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>18 : 01 being the determining factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. According to their findings, multiple hypoechoic blurred lesions typically observed in SAT were rarely found in patients positive for HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>18 : 01. These patients had different ultrasound patterns, which were mostly observed in patients with only HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>18 : 01, without any haplotype correlated with SAT. Most of these patients had a unilateral and single lesion that was homogenously hypoechoic and had filled the whole affected lobe, mimicking a large thyroid nodule. However, in patients with both HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>18 : 01 and HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>35, the main difference from the typical pattern was related to the shape of SAT lesions, which were patchy or round, imitating actual thyroid nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. It is worth mentioning that we did not perform any HLA testing for our patient.\n\n【15】Regardless of proper diagnosis and treatment, the chance of SAT recurrence is relatively high and varies between studies from a few to over 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34, 36\\]</u>. These controversies are probably due to different study populations (Caucasian vs. Asian). Recurrences of SAT can occur either soon after the treatment completion or after a significant time interval, sometimes many years from the first episode 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Until recently, the cause of SAT recurrences was unknown. The only findings were that excessively fast tapering of corticosteroids was one of the causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. As a matter of fact, the differential diagnosis of SAT is challenging and necessitates ruling out the false negative and false positive SAT cases due to disease mismanagement or any serious undiagnosed conditions, such as covert malignancies. Since hospitalized patients usually receive corticosteroids as the COVID-19 treatment protocol, treating any undiagnosed SAT in these patients does not often result in serious problems. However, the misdiagnosis of hyperthyroidism in the outpatients with symptoms suggestive of painless SAT might be challenging, and any misuse of antithyroid drugs should be avoided. The other important issue is that SAT can be the only sign of COVID-19. So, patients with SAT should be tested for COVID-19 to prevent disease spread.\n\n【16】According to other studies, 24 cases of concomitant or post-COVID-19 subacute thyroiditis were reported until March 26, 2021. If we consider the present study, 18 of these patients were female, while 7 were male. Subacute thyroiditis is a disease which is more common in women than men, but our case was male. The age range of the male patients was 34–58 years, while it was 18–69 years for women. Our patient’s age was in the age range of the mentioned patients.\n\n【17】The duration between COVID-19 infection and the onset of subacute thyroiditis was 1–6 weeks, including one week for 1 case, two weeks for 4 cases (include our case), three weeks for 1 case, four weeks for 13 cases, five weeks for 1 case, and six weeks for 2 cases. Concomitant onset was observed in 4 patients. Our patient’s previous infection with COVID-19 was confirmed by PCR, but in 10 cases, there was no mention of the previous PCR test for COVID-19 confirmation, and just the clinical findings and high-risk occupation and communications of patients were considered. Of these 10, 8 cases had serological tests indicated past infection with COVID-19. Thyroid function tests (TFT) showed thyrotoxicosis in all patients, including our patient, except for one case in which TFT was not available.

Data concerning their adverse effects has been lately describing central nervous system (CNS) demyelination process at escalating basis. Case Presentation. A 23-year-old male with autoimmune uveitis and a family history of multiple sclerosis (MS) developed two neurological attacks, after Adalimumab infusion, simultaneously with several cerebral lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hence the diagnosis of Adalimumab induced MS was suspected. Conclusion. This case is reported to tell physicians to be cautious when using anti-TNF-α in patients with family history of MS and to reconsider the risk of MS in patients with autoimmune diseases.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】TNF-α is a well-known proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokine. It mediates inflammatory cell recruitment to the site of the infection by activating endothelial cells. Elevated levels of this cytokine, however, were detected both locally and systemically in patients with inflammatory disorders like arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Drugs that block the effect of TNF-α have shown beyond dispute role in modulating the activity of many autoimmune diseases. Depending on their mechanism of action, anti-TNF-α drugs are divided into monoclonal antibodies (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Golimumab, and Certolizumab) and soluble TNF-α receptors (Etanercept). Many side effects have been recorded during the relatively short history of utilizing anti-TNF-α in the field of autoimmune diseases such as infectious disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, autoimmune disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>, blood dyscrasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>, pulmonary fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, congestive heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> among other adverse effects such as central and peripheral demyelination of the nervous system and optic neuritis.\n\n【4】CNS demyelination was conducted by several reports suggesting triggering or exacerbating demyelination diseases induced by treatment with anti-TNF-α.\n\n【5】In Table 1 we review the most important studies in medical literature concerning this idea.\n\n【6】Table 1 #### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 23-year-old Arabic gentleman from Syria had a positive family history of MS affecting two of his uncles (maternal and paternal uncles; no blood relationship existed between the parents) and idiopathic epilepsy affecting his sister. His past medical history was positive for chronic autoimmune uveitis since the age of 13. It was then treated with Methotrexate with poor response, and thus it was substituted for combination of Cyclosporine and Azathioprine which achieved a better control. A year ago, Azathioprine was suspended for a while because of the political situation and Adalimumab was initiated. Few days following the second dose of Adalimumab, the patient developed right hemibody anesthesia which lasted two weeks and was successfully treated with intravenous methylprednisolone. Adalimumab was then stopped and both of Azathioprine at a dose of 3 mg/kg and oral prednisolone were initiated. Five months later, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested and revealed multiple periventricular and juxtacortical lesions with high T2 signal intensity along with T2 hypersignal lesion in the spinal cord at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra C4; none of these lesions were contrast enhancing .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a, b, c, and d) Flair MRI slices (axial and coronal slices) show periventricular and juxtacortical high intensity lesions. (e) Axial T2 MRI shows multiple juxtacortical high intensity lesions. (f) Sagittal T2 MRI of the cervical spinal cord shows T2 hyperintense lesion at the level of C4.</u>\n\n【9】Visually evoked potentials (VEP) were also performed and were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal and negative for oligoclonal bands (OCBs).\n\n【10】Eight months following Adalimumab infusion, the patient had right lower limb paresis which was also successfully treated with methylprednisolone, and normal strength was restored within three weeks. Six months after then, the patient was referred by a rheumatologist to a neurology clinic for consultation and followup though there has been no new attack since then.\n\n【11】Neurological examination was normal except for anisocoria with slightly irregular pupils and bilaterally sluggish reaction to light (an abnormality that was explained by chronic uveitis) with normal fundoscopy and visual acuity. Mild right facial and body hemihypoesthesia, absent abdominal reflexes over the right side, generalized hyperreflexia (+3), and mild right lower limb spasticity were also noticed. To find out the relationship between the uveitis and the neurological attacks, the type of uveitis was reassessed and revealed hints of anterior and intermediate uveitis with no signs of active inflammation. An X-ray of sacroiliac joints and chest X-ray were then requested to rule out both subclinical ankylosing spondylitis and sarcoidosis and were both normal. Brain MRI with contrast was repeated and revealed no new lesions comparing with the previous one .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a and b) Axial T2 MRI shows multiple periventricular and juxtacortical high intensity lesions. (c) Coronal flair MRI shows periventricular and juxtacortical high intensity lesions.</u>\n\n【13】The previous laboratory study was reviewed and showed normal ordinary labs including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatic factor (RF), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies C-ANCA and P-ANCA were all negative. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) analysis revealed HLA-B27. CSF analysis showed acellular fluid with immunoglobulin G (IgG) index of 0.53, normal protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and glucose levels. Despite the lack of enhancement, diagnosis of Adalimumab induced MS was suspected in this patient with HLAB-27 associated uveitis depending on Mcdonald’s criteria for space and time distribution and the temporal relationship between the first neurological attack and drug initiation besides the positive family history of MS. Since there were no active lesions on MRI, treatment plan was continued with no modification and regular clinical and radiological followup was suggested.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】This case describes two separate neurological attacks in a young patient with HLA-B27 associated uveitis and a family history of multiple sclerosis. Although neurological attacks meet Mcdonald’s criteria for time and space distribution, many differential diagnoses are plausible for this presentation, MS with associated uveitis, HLA-B27 associated uveitis and a newly diagnosed MS as two separate entities, and systemic vasculitis induced uveitis and cerebral lesions. Infectious causes and lymphoma, however, are improbable due to the prolonged history and negative laboratory investigations.\n\n【16】A certain type of uveitis, uveitis pars planitis, is considered a manifestation of MS that often precedes or, less often, accompanies the first attacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The type of uveitis was reassessed accordingly and revealed both anterior and intermediate uveitis which is, along with the prolonged history of uveitis, less compatible with MS and more compatible with HLA-B27 uveitis with or without seronegative arthritis such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During 10 years of uveitis, the patient had no arthritis, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin lesions, or even lower back pain. Moreover, AXR of the pelvis revealed no sclerotic changes.\n\n【17】Despite its obscurity, a relationship between MS and autoimmune diseases was deduced because of the high prevalence of MS in patients with autoimmune diseases as suggested by many reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18–20\\]</u>. This speculation added to the positive family history of MS renders this patient highly susceptible to MS. Furthermore, the temporal relationship between the first attack and Adalimumab infusion makes Adalimumab induced or provoked MS the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【18】Suspected MS following anti-TNF-α treatment in patients with family history of MS was reported in many cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 18\\]</u> which recommended that anti-TNF-α should be avoided in such patients and advocated requesting cerebral MRI before treatment initiation in patients with high risk of MS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Several mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the paradox of MS activation in spite of amelioration of systemic inflammation following anti-TNF-α infusion such as the presence of blood brain barrier (BBB). This barrier halts the entry of anti-TNF-α drugs to CNS. Meanwhile, these drugs enhance T cell receptor signaling and the functionality of antigen presenting cells and, consequently, they activate CNS demyelination. This is the essence of lack of entry theory. Presence of BBB was also the culprit in sponge theory wherein TNF-α is supposed to be drawn out of joint synovial fluid following TNF-α antagonism whereas BBB prevents this process in CNS. Thus TNF-α gradient develops across BBB and results in upregulation of TNF-α receptor expression in CNS. Moreover, severely destructed BBB in experimental autoimmune encephalopathy mice models besides the high dose used have been supposed to facilitate anti-TNF-α entry to CNS and permit the subsequent amelioration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Other theories hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is a potential regenerator of oligodendrocytes. Hence blocking TNF-α may prevent this natural mechanism and suppress remyelination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Another hypothesis postulated that anti-TNF-α drugs promote interferon γ (INF-γ) expression and this in turn disturbs the balance between INF-β and INF-γ levels which triggers demyelination process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Whether the precise mechanism is uncovering or inducing demyelination is still undetermined.\n\n【20】Although some points argue against MS such as OCBs negativity and the lack of contrast enhancement, MS negative OCBs are a well-established entity that represents 20–30% of MS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Moreover, OCBs could be detected later on during the circumstance of MS. No clear data is available regarding frequency of OCBs negativity in anti-TNF-α induced MS since most of the reports of similar cases did not mention the results of OCBs analysis. The lack of enhancement, however, may be explained by the time window between performing MRI and the clinical attacks; such window would have guaranteed the resolution of enhancement if it existed in addition to treatment with Azathioprine, a drug that has been accepted as a disease modifying treatment of MS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Asymptomatic cerebral lesions highly suggestive of MS are widely described in patients with family history of MS under the title of radiographically isolated syndrome (RIS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 28\\]</u>, but explicit clinical attacks turn RIS into clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or MS. Most of the reported cases depicted several months of using anti-TNF-α agents preceding the development of clinical attacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 16\\]</u>, while in this case development of the first clinical attack took place days following the second dose, a period that suggests a process of uncovering latent MS rather than inducing it. Even though second clinical attack occurred approximately eight months after halting Adalimumab, MRI performed six months later revealed no active disease; consequently no treatment modification was suggested, and if hints of clinical or radiological activity are noticed later on, Rituximab would be the treatment of choice of both uveitis and MS.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】MS is highly expected in patients with family history of MS and, to a lesser degree, in patients with autoimmune diseases, and physician should consider such risks in patients who are eligible for anti-TNF treatment by detailed history, examination, and close followup as well as performing MRI prior to therapy initiation in highly suspected individuals.\n\n【24】#### Abbreviations\n\n| TNF-α: | Tumor necrosis factor α |\n| --- | --- |\n| CNS: | Central nervous system |\n| MS: | Multiple sclerosis |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| VEP: | Visually evoked potentials |\n| CSF: | Cerebrospinal fluid |\n| OCBs: | Oligoclonal bands |\n| ESR: | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate |\n| CRP: | C-reactive protein |\n| ANA: | Antinuclear antibodies |\n| RF: | Rheumatic factor |\n| ANCA: | Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies |\n| HLA: | Human leukocyte antigen |\n| IgG: | Immunoglobulin G |\n| LDH: | Lactate dehydrogenase |\n| IBD: | Inflammatory bowel disease |\n| BBB: | Blood brain barrier |\n| TNFR2: | Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 |\n| INF: | Interferon |\n| RIS: | Radiographically isolated syndrome |\n| CIS: | Clinically isolated syndrome. |\n\n【26】#### Additional Points\n\n【27】Availability of Data and Materials.

Pulmonary hypertension secondary to scurvy is a rare manifestation that historically has not been well studied and is only described in a handful of case reports. Case. Our case is about a 35-year-old female with a history significant for drug and tobacco abuse, obesity, poor diet, anxiety, and major depressive disorder who was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension in the setting of vitamin C deficiency (<0.01 mg/L). Conclusion. We present a case that shows pulmonary hypertension can be associated with scurvy and reversed rapidly with adequate vitamin C supplementation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In the United States and other developed countries, it is often assumed the incidence of vitamin C deficiency or scurvy is negligible due to widespread accessibility to fortified foods and vitamins. However, individuals who live alone and have a history of substance abuse, restrictive diet, or mental illness are much more likely to develop scurvy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Common early manifestations of scurvy include anemia, bone pain, easy bruisability, petechiae, gum disease, perifollicular hemorrhages on lower extremities, and mood alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A rare manifestation is pulmonary hypertension. A literature review from January 2020 found 10 cases written about pulmonary hypertension due to vitamin C deficiency. In all these cases, there was rapid resolution of the patient’s pulmonary hypertension after supplementation with vitamin C 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, there are not any current guidelines or long-term follow-ups (maximum 1 year) to treatments documented. It is thought that vitamin C deficiency leads to pulmonary hypertension secondary to decreased degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and decreased activity of nitrous oxide synthase (NOS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Our case is about a 35-year-old female who was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension in the setting of scurvy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】Our patient was a 35-year-old female with a past medical history significant for obesity, substance abuse, tobacco abuse (22-pack-year history), major depressive disorder, anxiety, and poor diet (primarily cheese steaks, chicken, and pork chops) who was admitted to our hospital with painful lower extremity swelling, shortness of breath, gingival bleeding, decreased oral intake, and ecchymosis which had been progressively getting worse over the past 6 months. The patient’s course prior to admission included failed treatment with corticosteroids for suspected vasculitis/undifferentiated connective tissue disease and multiple transfusions in the setting of persistent anemia. The patient presented with a heart rate at 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/59, respiratory rate at 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed an extremely pale-appearing individual who had poor dental hygiene with mild pooling of blood in the oral cavity, diffuse joint swelling with ecchymosis , perifollicular petechiae with some corkscrew hairs , tenderness in the lower extremities, and decreased breath sounds with mild crackles.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Peripheral ecchymosis which is commonly found as a cutaneous manifestation of scurvy.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Corkscrew hair and perifollicular petechiae which are commonly seen in scurvy.</u>\n\n【8】The patient’s labs were significant for hemoglobin: 6.6 g/dl (ref: 12.0–15.3 g/dl), prothrombin time/internalized normalized ratio (PT-INR): 1.50 (ref: 0.87–1.17), platelets: 152 K/uL (ref: 140–400 K/uL), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP): 2714 pg/ml (ref: 0–299 pg/ml), folate <2.0 ng/ml (ref: >4.5 ng/ml), and thiamine <7 nmol/L (ref: 8–30 nmol/L). Blood cultures came back positive for Streptococcus anginosus in 2/4 bottles, for which she was initially treated with amoxicillin/sulbactam and later transitioned to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for a total of 14 days. In the setting of persistent anemia and acute worsening thrombocytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy was done and showed dyserythropoiesis, nuclear cytoplasmic asynchrony, and erythroid hyperplasia. A peripheral blood smear described increased anisocytosis of the red blood cells, left-shifted neutrophils with immature forms present, and small-to-medium platelets with normal morphology. A ventilation/perfusion scan was done which ruled out pulmonary embolism. Full vasculitis and viral workup was negative. Urine toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines and morphine/codeine.\n\n【9】Given her constellation of symptoms and poor nutrition, scurvy was on the differential and was started on daily vitamin C supplementation. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was ordered in the setting of bacteremia, which was negative to vegetation but was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 86 mmHg, dilated inferior vena cava with a right atrial pressure of 15 mmHg, and severely enlarged right ventricle with flattening of the interventricular septum positive for D-sign . The left ventricle was concentrically hypertrophic with an ejection fraction of 70% and had a left ventricular outflow tract septal obstruction from an enlarged right ventricle. These findings further decreased suspicion for septic cardiomyopathy as TTE findings did not correlate and the patient continued to have symptoms despite antibiotic treatment. Although rare, thoracic medicine suspected the pulmonary hypertension was secondary to scurvy, and it would resolve with vitamin C supplementation as had been described in a few case reports. The decision was made to defer starting diuretic therapy or vasodilators. Ascorbic acid levels returned severely deficient two days after initiation of supplements at <0.1 mg/L, ref: 0.3–2.7 mg/dl. Within a week, the patient reported improvement in her shortness of breath, lower extremity tenderness, and gingival bleeding. She was discharged with vitamin C 500 mg twice daily and a follow-up right heart catheterization with TTE two weeks after initial initiation of supplementation.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 This image was obtained by the transthoracic echocardiogram using a parasternal short-axis view. There is increased pressure/volume in the right ventricle and flattening of the interventricular septum creating a D-shaped right ventricle (known as a D-sign). In our case, this right ventricular strain is secondary to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature.</u>\n\n【11】Repeat TTE was negative for any indications of pulmonary hypertension: the right ventricle size and right atrial pressure (3 mmHg) were normal. Right heart catheterization had a baseline mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 19, wedge pressure of 10, and pulmonary vasculature resistance (PVR) of 1 WU. Postsaline mPAP was 29, wedge pressure was 15, and PVR was 1.7 WU. Findings did not meet criteria for pulmonary hypertension, however did suggest mild noncompliance of the pulmonary vasculature that can be explained by mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【12】The patient was assessed by cardiology two years later with resolution of her shortness of breath and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension noted on examination.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Pulmonary hypertension is a rare symptom of vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) that has not been thoroughly investigated with documentation only in a handful of case reports. In our case, the patient’s severe pulmonary hypertension resolved after 2 weeks of vitamin C supplementation. When comparing our patient’s presentation with previous cases, there were similarities such as dilation of the right ventricle, elevated BNP, and rapid resolution of pulmonary hypertension with vitamin C supplementation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Unlike other cases documented in the past, our case can confirm continued resolution of pulmonary hypertension at least two years after initiation of supplementation.\n\n【15】The exact mechanism of how scurvy leads to pulmonary hypertension is still unclear. One theory is that vitamin C acts as a reducing agent to activate EGLN prolyl hydroxylase which in turn hydroxylates HIFa. Hydroxylated HIFa is then targeted by von Hippel–Lindau protein for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. When vitamin C is low, there are increased levels of HIFa which binds with transcription factor HIFb to upregulate transcription of vasoconstrictive genes such as vasoconstrictor endothelin (EDN1) that increase pulmonary vasoconstriction and smooth muscle proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>. This mechanism is similar to vitamin C’s role as a cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases for collagen synthesis, where a lack of it is attributable to many of scurvy’s common manifestations such as poor wound healing, gingival bleeding, and arthralgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Vitamin C has also been shown to increase nitrous oxide synthase (NOS) activity by degrading asymmetric dimethyl L-arginine (NOS inhibitor), inhibiting arginase (increased L-arginine to be used to make NO), and increasing the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) (essential cofactor of NOS). Therefore, vitamin C deficiency leads to decreased availability of NO and consequently pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased vascular tone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In developed countries, smoking history, long-term alcoholism, low income, obesity, psychiatric illness, old age, and voluntarily restrictive diets are risk factors for scurvy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10\\]</u>. In particular, smokers have increased risk of attaining pulmonary hypertension secondary to scurvy as they have three times less vitamin C than nonsmokers and have higher incidences of hypoxia which also increase the levels of HIF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 11\\]</u>. Our patient had a long-term history of smoking, psychiatric illness, poor diet, and poor oral intake which all contributed to her vitamin C deficiency. The presumed rarity of the disease may also be inaccurate as some studies have shown the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency can be as high as 25% in low-income families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is therefore important to keep in mind these risk factors so that diagnosis and treatment can occur early before irreversible damage occurs.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】In conclusion, we present a case of pulmonary hypertension secondary to vitamin C deficiency that rapidly resolved and continued to be resolved two years later with supplementation. As there are no current guidelines recommending looking for vitamin C deficiency as a culprit for pulmonary hypertension, it is likely that many cases are missed. We believe that all individuals with the risk factors outlined above who are found to have pulmonary hypertension should be screened for vitamin C deficiency.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Previous contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) for follow-up after breast cancer surgery had indicated a soft tissue mass below the right diaphragm, which was considered a benign change. CE-CT performed at the first visit to our department revealed further thickening of the soft tissue mass with extension to the liver surface. In addition, ascites and nodules were observed in the abdominal cavity. Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen revealed peritoneal invasion of atypical epithelioid cells with trabecular and glandular patterns.

A diagnosis of epithelioid mesothelioma was made. The patient received chemotherapy with cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). After six courses of combined chemotherapy, pemetrexed was administered as a single agent.

Introduction\n\n【3】Malignant mesothelioma is a rare, insidious, aggressive tumor that originates from the mesothelial surface of the pleural and peritoneal cavities, the pericardium, or the tunica vaginalis. In the United States, malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) accounts for up to 15% of all cases of mesothelioma, and it is rapidly fatal. MPM is difficult to diagnose because of its nonspecific clinical symptoms and findings. The common symptoms are abdominal pain or a palpable abdominal mass. MPM often develops near the pelvis, rectum, urinary bladder, or uterus. Generally, it is treated with surgical resection or chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Her medical history did not include any apparent episodes of asbestos exposure. Physical examination at the first visit showed normal vital signs, a flat and soft abdomen, and tenderness in the lower abdomen.\n\n【6】Blood tests showed no abnormal values, and tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, and CA 125 were within normal limits. Previous contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) for follow-up after breast cancer surgery had indicated a soft tissue mass below the right diaphragm, which was considered a benign change. CE-CT performed at the first visit to our department revealed further thickening of the soft tissue mass with extension to the liver surface. In addition, ascites and nodules were observed in the abdominal cavity 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed abnormal uptake by the soft tissue mass and nodules in the abdominal cavity. No abnormal uptake was observed in the other organs. On the basis of the FDG-PET findings, malignancy was suspected. A biopsy was performed under transabdominal wall ultrasound guidance, and histopathological examination revealed peritoneal invasion of atypical epithelioid cells with trabecular and glandular patterns. Atypical cells also invaded the skeletal muscles. Considering the skeletal muscle invasion, the atypical cells were suspected to be malignant epithelioid neoplasia. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor cells were positive for AE1/AE2, calretinin, WT-1, D2-40, HEG1, EMA, BAP1, and MTAP and negative for CEA, MOC-31, Ber-Ep4, ER, PgR, TTF-1, claudin 4, and desmin. Based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was diagnosed as an epithelioid mesothelioma 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b)\\-(A) = calretinin, (B) = WT-1, and (C) = D2-40)</u>. Because the FDG-PET findings strongly suggested peritoneal dissemination, radical treatment by surgical resection was considered difficult, and systemic chemotherapy was administered. Chemotherapy with cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was initiated. CT evaluation 12 months after the start of treatment showed no changes in the tumor, and the treatment was continued. After six courses of combined chemotherapy, pemetrexed was administered as a single agent because the total cisplatin dose exceeded 500 mg. At the time of writing this report, she was undergoing over the 30th course of chemotherapy without any significant side effects. CT performed 48 months after the start of chemotherapy showed stable disease with amelioration of the abdominal symptoms observed at the initial examination 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Imaging and immunohistochemistry of the lesion.

Discussion\n\n【9】Peritoneal mesothelioma was first reported by Miller and Wynn in 1908. Among all mesotheliomas, peritoneal lesions are rare; most mesotheliomas occur in the pleura and peritoneum, with 80% involving the pleura and 20% involving the peritoneum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Diffuse MPM, like the one observed in the present case, reportedly accounts for 10%–30% of all mesotheliomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Asbestos exposure is considered a major cause of pleural mesothelioma. Although the frequency of a history of asbestos exposure is lower for peritoneal mesothelioma than for pleural mesothelioma, an association with asbestos exposure has been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. According to some reports on the prognosis of MPM, the 5-year survival rate is 29%–59%, and there are no specific symptoms or clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. MPM is categorized into three pathological subtypes: epithelioid (the most frequent), sarcomatoid, and mixed (biphasic) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Measurement of biomarkers is recommended for the diagnosis of mesothelioma. In addition, the absence of BAP1 and MTAP loss is effective in distinguishing the epithelioid and sarcomatoid types; however, it is not 100% accurate, and peritoneal mesothelioma can also show the absence of MTAP loss. The treatment of mesothelioma includes chemotherapy and surgical resection. In addition, various treatment modalities are being explored, including radiation therapy and HIPEC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. One study suggests the possibility of radical surgical resection after HIPEC, but the rate of achievement is not high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, chemotherapy was chosen because of the possibility of peritoneal dissemination. In general, there is no established chemotherapy regimen for unresectable, advanced-stage peritoneal mesothelioma; regimens used for pleural mesothelioma are used for such cases. Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin, carboplatin, or gemcitabine is recommended, and the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin is widely used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A phase III study of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin for patients with MPM reported a response rate of 41.3% and a median survival time of 12.1 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Jänne et al. reported a response rate and median survival time of 23.3% and 13.1 months, respectively, for the same regimen in patients with peritoneal mesothelioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Targeted therapy, such as gene therapy, is based on the method of administering a thymidine kinase gene conjugate to the Herpes simplex virus and then administering an antiviral agent to kill it. This option could not be explored in the present case because of insufficient tissue mass in the peritoneal biopsy. Moreover, previous studies have evaluated the predicted biomarkers for pemetrexed-treated mesothelioma. High folylpoly-γ\\-glutamate synthetase and low thymidylate synthase levels have been associated with the sensitivity of pemetrexed; however, we did not examine these biomarkers in the present case. Given that comprehensive gene panel tests for advanced solid tumors are covered by insurance in Japan, it is possible to test these biomarkers if there is sufficient tumor volume.\n\n【12】In the present case, the patient was treated with chemotherapy comprising cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), and cisplatin administration was interrupted because irreversible side effects such as peripheral neuropathy and renal failure occurred when the total dose exceeded 500 mg. Single-agent pemetrexed was administered after six courses of combined chemotherapy. For elderly and unfit patients in particular, single-agent pemetrexed (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously every 3 weeks) has been recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Accordingly, maintenance chemotherapy with single-agent pemetrexed was selected for our patient, and she achieved long-term survival (>5 years) with this treatment; at the time of writing this report, she was still receiving chemotherapy without severe adverse events. It is considered that the long-term effect of the treatment led to prolonged survival. In the CALGB 30901 trial, maintenance therapy with pemetrexed following initial pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy did not improve progression-free survival in patients with MPM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Of late, cases of resectable MPM have been receiving combination therapy with cytoreductive surgery, such as total peritoneal resection and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Intraperitoneal administration of cytotoxic agents can improve their therapeutic activity. Determining the effect of systemic or intraperitoneal chemotherapy on tumor progression in these patients is difficult because of the lack of evidence in the medical article; therefore, further prospective studies are warranted. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare malignancy, and it is difficult to conduct large-scale clinical trials of patients with this condition. Since we report only one case, the utility of maintenance therapy with pemetrexed should be examined in a clinical trial. In addition, biomarker research on the long-term effects of this treatment should be conducted in the future.\n\n【13】In conclusion, diffuse MPM is a rare, fatal, and progressive disease. However, our patient achieved long-term survival of more than 5 years with maintenance therapy using single-agent pemetrexed. This may be because pemetrexed has no tolerable dose and is administered only once every three weeks with an infusion time of 30 minutes, ensuring good compliance and reducing patient burden. All these indicate that pemetrexed therapy may help in maintaining long-term tumor shrinkage without severe side effects.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We report two rare cases of biliary obstruction by pseudolithiasis shortly after completing CTRX treatment. Stones and sludge, which had not been detected before CTRX administration, appeared in the gallbladder and common bile duct and led to biliary obstruction and acute cholangitis. The obstructions were successfully treated with endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage and endoscopic sphincterotomy. CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis has been reported mainly in children and adolescents but is also seen in adults with similar incidence rate. Although CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis is usually asymptomatic and disappears spontaneously after discontinuing the drug, some patients develop biliary obstruction. Endoscopic managements should be considered in such cases.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Ceftriaxone (CTRX), a widely used third-generation cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum and a long half-life of 6 to 9 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In some cases, CTRX is known to precipitate with calcium ion in the biliary tract. The precipitation usually disappears after discontinuation of CTRX and is thus called biliary pseudolithiasis. Since the first report in 1986 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, biliary pseudolithiasis caused by CTRX has been reported mainly in children and adolescents but also in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Although the calcified lesions usually disappear spontaneously after discontinuation of CTRX, they sometimes cause acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, or acute pancreatitis, requiring interventions.\n\n【4】We report two cases of biliary obstruction by CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis that required endoscopic managements.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 91-year-old woman with stage 5 chronic kidney disease possibly due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis or chronic glomerulonephritis was admitted to the Department of Nephrology of our hospital because of a 2-week history of dyspnea. Physical examination on admission was not remarkable except for oxygen saturation of 91% on 2 L/min of oxygen and pretibial pitting edema. Laboratory examinations showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 5,300/μL (reference range (RR): 3,300–8,600), C-reactive protein (CRP) 2.17 mg/dL (RR: 0–0.14), blood urea nitrogen 80.3 mg/dL (RR: 8.0–20.0), serum creatinine 5.69 mg/dL (RR: 0.46–0.79), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 24 U/L (RR: 13–30), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 9 U/L (RR: 7–23), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 276 mg/dL (RR: 124–222), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 326 U/L (RR: 103–322), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) 42 U/L (RR: 9–32), total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL (RR: 0.4–1.5), and serum amylase 104 U/L (RR: 44–132). Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed ground-glass appearance of the bilateral lung field and consolidations of the right middle lobe and left lower lobe. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary edema and pneumonia and was treated with 2 g of CTRX intravenously every 24 hours for 10 days along with intravenous furosemide. Three days after ending the administration of CTRX, she complained of right upper abdominal pain. Laboratory data demonstrated worsening of the liver function: AST 232 U/L, ALT 46 U/L, LDH 481 mg/dL, ALP 866 U/L, γ-GTP 167 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, and serum amylase 115 U/L. CT scan revealed small stones and sludge in the gallbladder and common bile duct, which had not been detected in the CT scan on admission 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u>. A diagnosis of grade II cholangitis due to CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis was made, and the patient was referred to the Department of Internal Medicine. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) demonstrated the absence of bile excretion from the ampulla of Vater, indicating bile congestion by obstruction of the common bile duct 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) by inserting a biliary stent resulted in excretion of the bile 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>, and cholangitis resolved after the procedure.

Case 2\n\n【11】An 82-year-old woman visited the hospital because of diarrhea and mild abdominal pain in the umbilical region. She had a medical history of dermatomyositis, interstitial pneumonitis, diabetes mellitus, and chronic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction and a relatively low left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and was receiving 9 mg of prednisolone and 2 mg of tacrolimus. A diagnosis of acute enteritis was made. In addition to fasting and intravenous hydration, she was treated with 2 g of intravenous CTRX every 24 hours for 5 days, and subsequently with oral levofloxacin at 500 mg once daily for 5 days after campylobacter had been cultured from the stool obtained on admission. She recovered fully and was discharged on day 13. Two days after discharge, she complained of severe upper abdominal pain and back pain. Laboratory data showed leukocytosis (WBC count 14,000/μL), elevation of CRP (1.42 mg/dL), mild liver dysfunction (AST 47 U/L, ALT 18 U/L, LDH 235 U/L, ALP 233 U/L, γ-GTP 73 U/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL), and elevations of serum amylase (938 U/L) and lipase (4113 U/L, RR: 12–52). CT scan revealed small stones and sludge in the gallbladder and common bile duct, which had not been detected two weeks earlier . She was diagnosed with grade II acute cholangitis and grade 1 acute pancreatitis. Emergent ERC showed deposition of white sludge on the ampulla of Vater and absence of bile excretion 删除1:<u>(Figure 4(a))</u>. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and ERBD were performed, resulting in excretion of the bile 删除1:<u>(Figure 4(b))</u> and resolution of the abdominal pain. Hydration required for the treatment of acute pancreatitis exacerbated the heart failure, making the treatment of acute pancreatitis difficult.

Discussion\n\n【15】We experienced two cases of common bile duct stones and sludge causing acute cholangitis shortly after completing CTRX treatment, which required endoscopic managements. Acute pancreatitis was also seen in Case 2. In both cases, biliary stones or sludge had not been detected in the CT scan 2 weeks before the onset. In Case 1, the stones and sludge spontaneously disappeared 4 weeks later. The white fine precipitation observed in Case 2 was different from the appearance of ordinary biliary stones consisting mainly of cholesterol or bilirubin. These observations strongly indicated that CTRX induced the biliary stones and sludge. Previous studies demonstrated that intravenously administered CTRX is excreted to the bile as a divalent anion and can precipitate with calcium ion to form calcium-CTRX complex at a dose of 2 g or higher 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5–8\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Cases of pseudolithiasis have been reported mainly in children and adolescents with an incidence of 17–57% after CTRX administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–14\\]</u>. In most cases, biliary pseudolithiasis was detected between 3 and 14 days after initiating CTRX administration and completely resolved within a few weeks after discontinuing CTRX. Biliary symptoms, such as right upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, were reported in 0–20% of these cases. Although the CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis is less well studied in adults, the clinical features including the incidence rate are similar to those for children and adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Interventional procedures are required in some cases of CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis when the stones or sludge induce biliary obstruction, leading to acute cholangitis or acute pancreatitis as in our cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 17–20\\]</u>. Endoscopic procedures, such as EST and/or ERBD, are the treatment of choice in such cases because they are less invasive than surgical procedures. Most of the previous reports performed surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 17–19\\]</u>, and there is only one case report in the English literature which reported endoscopic management for CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Because discontinuation of CTRX usually leads to spontaneous resolution of biliary pseudolithiasis, we believe that cholecystectomy should be considered only when biliary obstruction persists even after discontinuing the drug and endoscopic managements are difficult. This point is supported by a case of an 18-month-old boy with CTRX-induced cholecystitis, where stones in the gallbladder detected during CTRX administration were not found in the gallbladder resected 9 days after discontinuing the drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】CTRX-induced biliary pseudolithiasis is usually asymptomatic and disappears spontaneously after discontinuation of the drug, making the complication easily overlooked especially in adults. However, some patients develop biliary obstruction requiring emergent procedures, and thus caution is necessary during CTRX administration. Once biliary obstruction occurs, endoscopic managements such as EST and ERBD should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Both patients received liposomal amphotericin B then posaconazole combined with aggressive surgical debridement of necrotic tissues with a favorable clinical outcome. Mixed etiology AIFR can influence the outcome; hence, further studies are required upon this new threat.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has increased and become one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. Most of these infections are described in patients with diabetes mellitus, hematologic malignancies, and solid organ transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Bacterial coinfection in SARS-CoV-2, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenza, and fungal coinfection, including Aspergillus or Mucoraceae species have become a serious concern in the management of patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Both of these fungal infections have been well described as complications of COVID-19, especially among critically ill patients in intensive care units 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Herein, we report two cases of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFR) with combined Aspergillus and Mucoraceae species.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【6】The first case was a healthy 31-year-old woman with a five-day history of fever (38.5°C), myalgia, and severe dyspnea (SpO<sub>2</sub> was 85%–room air), who referred to the emergency department. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. High-resolution chest CTs obtained at admission showed multifocal areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacification with peripheral and basal predominance. Supportive oxygen therapy with nasal cannula and treatment with remdesivir at a dose of 200 mg on day one and 100 mg/d for five days with methylprednisolone 80 mg every 12 hours were prescribed. Methylprednisolone continued for two days and then switched to dexamethasone 4 mg/d, which continued for additional four days. The patient’s condition improved over ten days, and the patient was discharged with SpO<sub>2</sub> = 93%, afebrile, and improved cough. Several days after discharge, the patient referred to our hospital with a history of headache, left retro-orbital pain, and nasal discharge and was readmitted. At admission, physical examination showed a hemodynamically and respiratory stable patient. The initial laboratory data were as follows: white blood cells (WBC) 13000/μl, platelet (PLT) 240000/μl, hemoglobin (Hb) 10 gr/dl, creatinine (Cr) 0.7, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 26 mg/dl. On physical examination, the extraoral swelling over the left side of the face and the numbness of the left side of the upper lip was remarkable. Subsequently, the computed tomography of sinuses and lungs was performed . According to the mucosal thickening and accumulation of secretions in paranasal sinuses, the patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery and severe involvement with the necrosis of the left-side lateral nasal wall and left maxillary sinuses were observed. The direct smear of the specimen revealed broad aseptated hyphae and septated hyphae. The sample was cultured with colonies phenotypically identified as Aspergillus flavus and Mucoraceae species. Sequencing of the ribosomal DNA was performed by amplification, and identification of Rhizopus arrhizus (formerly called Rhizopus oryzae) was confirmed . The patient received treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>). After 15 days of liposomal amphotericin B therapy and removal of necrotic tissues, the therapy switched to posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg every 6 hours). No evidence of recurrence was found at her one-month follow-up.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Ostiomeatal complex (OMC) is obstructed leading to mucosal thickening and accumulation of secretions in paranasal sinuses.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Direct smear revealed hyphae with characteristics consistent with Mucorales (a).

Case 2\n\n【11】The second case was a 58-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension who referred to the emergency department due to nasal obstruction with complaints of purulent discharge, left side facial pain with numbness, and swelling of the upper eyelid and the left cheek. The patient was hospitalized three weeks before the admission with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and was treated with remdesivir at a dose of 200 mg on day one followed by 100 mg/d and dexamethasone 8 mg/d for five days. The initial laboratory data were as follows: WBC 7300/μl, PLT 141000/μl, Hb 8.9 gr/dl, Cr 1.4, and CRP 31 mg/dl. SpO<sub>2</sub> was 92% at room. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent, and his blood sugar level and HbA1c were 210 mg/dl and 6%, respectively. Physical examination showed the ptosis of the left eye associated with periorbital edema and numbness of the left cheek. The findings of the sinuses CT scan were opacity in the left maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses . The endoscopy sinus surgery showed necrotic tissues in the left middle turbinate and left maxillary sinus associated with profuse purulent discharge. The histopathological examination of tissue sections revealed a vascular structure (large arrow) involved and filled with both thin and broad (smaller arrow) fungal hyphae . The sample was cultured with colonies phenotypically identified as Aspergillus fumigatus and Mucoraceae species. PCR amplification and sequencing was performed, and the Mucoraceae species was identified as Rhizopus arrhizus (formerly called Rhizopus oryzae) . The patient received treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>). After 17 days of liposomal amphotericin B therapy and removal of all necrotic tissues, the therapy switched to posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg every 6 hours).

Discussion\n\n【17】AIFR is a time-sensitive condition that must be diagnosed and treated promptly to avoid serious complications. The most common etiologic agents of these invasive fungal infections include Mucoraceae species and Aspergillus species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Rhizopus oryzae and Aspergillus flavus are the most common organisms isolated from patients with AIFR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6,7\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Mucormycosis is an angioinvasive opportunistic infection caused by fungi belonging to the Mucorales order and the Mucoraceae family. This invasive fungal infection is recognized as one of the most rapidly progressive lethal forms of fungal infection with a high mortality of 70–100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8,9\\]</u>. Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis is the most commonly reported form of the disease characterized by progressive invasion of the hard palate, paranasal sinuses, orbit, and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This clinical manifestation of mucormycosis is observed mainly in patients with uncontrolled diabetes or having immunosuppressive conditions, such as corticosteroid treatment with immunosuppressive doses, cancer chemotherapy, hematological stem cell transplants, prolonged neutropenia, and solid organ transplants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Aspergillus species are ubiquitous molds found in diverse environments throughout the year. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common and life-threatening fungal pathogen, which is particularly important among immunocompromised hosts. Aspergillus flavus more commonly causes rhinosinusitis. Pulmonary aspergillosis and sinusitis are the most common sites of invasive aspergillosis most frequently observed in the setting of immunosuppression status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 12–14\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Cases of secondary fungal infections, such as aspergillosis and mucormycosis, have been reported since the emergence of COVID-19, demonstrating the importance of COVID-19-associated invasive fungal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Imaging modalities, including CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging, can help to suggest a diagnosis of AIFR, and biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Direct mycological and histological examinations are the gold standard for diagnosis. In mucormycosis and aspergillosis, the hyphae are specific for each fungus; Mucoraceae presents large, broad aseptated hyphae with right-angle branching, and Aspergillus shows septated hyphae that branch at 45° angles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Coinfection with mucormycosis and aspergillosis is a rare entity, and very few cases have been published in the literature. Johnson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> reported a case of combined probable pulmonary aspergillosis and possible mucormycosis in a diabetic male with COVID-19 in the ICU who was treated with liposomal amphotericin B. Zayet et al. reported a case of cerebro-rhino-orbital mucormycosis and aspergillosis coinfection in a patient with diabetes mellitus with complete recovery after antifungal therapy combined with surgical debridement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Anita et al. reported three cases of mucormycosis combined with aspergillosis caused by Rhizopus species and Aspergillus flavus with favorable clinical outcomes. The patients were treated with surgical debridement combined with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B, and two cases received step-down therapy with posaconazole. One of the cases was a 52-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In another report, a 55-year-old diabetic male patient was hospitalized with a three-day history of dyspnea, fever, and generalized malaise. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed. He was started on methylprednisolone (40 mg twice daily), along with general supportive care and management of diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with ptosis and diplopia on day 10 of discharge and rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis caused by mixed proven infections of Rhizopus arrhizus and Aspergillus flavus were confirmed. The patient received amphotericin B and after 17 days of therapy, the patient recovered clinically. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was the main predisposing factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Several mechanisms in COVID-19 predispose the patients to fungal infections. Endothelial damage and immune dysfunction are known complications of COVID-19, which may provide an opportunity for Aspergillus and Mucoraceae species to invade tissues. A decline in cell-mediated immunity has been observed, including leukopenia, lymphopenia, and T-cell dysregulation. COVID-19 associated lymphopenia is attributed to the production of cytokines and a decrease in CD4+T and CD8+T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 23\\]</u>. In addition, the usage of corticosteroids (CSs) in the treatment of COVID-19 may further predispose the patients to these fungal infections, which are attributed to CS-induced hyperglycemia or immunosuppression status caused by high doses of CS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24,25\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Our data indicate that both patients we presented had AIFR caused by proven aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Patient 1 had no other underlying comorbidity, and COVID-19 infection per se was the main risk factor for predisposing the patient to both infections. However, the CS therapy could possibly play a role in this process. In case 2, the combined risk factors, including COVID-19 infection, diabetes mellitus, CS treatment, and its induced hyperglycemia, contributed to invasive fungal infections.\n\n【25】Timely diagnosis of AIFR is critical to enable early initiation of active antifungal therapy. Complete surgical debridement of necrotic tissues, and when feasible, control of the underlying medical condition are the cornerstones of the therapy. Additionally, empiric antifungal therapy should be based on polyene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【26】This paper presents two cases of COVID-19 associated AIFR with mixed fungal etiology of Aspergillus flavus and Rhizopus arrhizus in case 1 and Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus in case 2. These two case reports highlight that combined aspergillosis and mucormycosis can present as complications of COVID-19. Mixed etiology AIFR can also influence the outcome; therefore, further studies are required upon this challenging threat.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Limited joint mobility (LJM) is a rare disease that complicates all types of diabetes and might indicate the high-risk odd for the diabetic patients to develop microvascular complications. We are reporting a 13-year-old female child with chronic uncontrolled type 1DM presenting with full blown clinical picture of bilateral hand LJM associated with significant growth failure yet has no clinical or biochemical evidence of microvascular complications. Literature research studies have emphasized the rarity of this manifestation in pediatric type 1 diabetic patients; however, it is an important clue and warning sign for microvascular complication occurrence in these patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Limited joint mobility (LJM) previously known as cheiroarthropathy or stiff hand syndrome is a progressive flexion deformity which affects mainly hand digits and sometimes associated with thickened waxy and tight overlying skin and characterized clinically by painless limited extension of the proximal metacarpophalangeal joints and/or interphalangeal joints with fixed flexion of the fingers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is the most frequent joint-related disease in adult diabetic patients. Although it is seen in nondiabetic patients, multiple digit involvement is more prevalent in diabetic patients compared with the nondiabetic control group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In diabetes mellitus, its pathology is due to progressive nonenzymatic glycation of the collagen making it resistant to the collagenase enzyme leading to capsular thickening and dermal fibrosis with end result of loss of the connective tissue elasticity and might be complicated by joint deformity, found to be correlated with the duration of poor glycemic control and microvascular complications. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】It was initially thought to be seen in juvenile type 1 diabetic patients with growth failure; however, it is considered an early complication in both types of diabetes and affects all the ages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is prevalent in adult diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy or diabetic foot complications. In one study, all diabetic patients with LJM were found to have clinical evidence of microvascular complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>; that is why, it is important to diagnose it as it might be the earlier warning signal for the presence of one or more of the microvascular complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.\n\n【6】Generally, this disorder might improve by strict glycemic control and physiotherapy.\n\n【7】We are reporting an adolescent female with long standing uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus presenting with the typical history and clinical signs of bilateral hand limited joint mobility disease.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【9】A 14-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM) since the age of 6 months, reported progressive painless stiffness in both hands over two-year duration, progressed into limited movements of all hands’ joints including the wrist and interphalangeal joints associated with tightening of the overlying skin but without evidence of Raynaud phenomenon.\n\n【10】Her diabetes had been always poorly controlled with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ranging between 10 and 12%. Although she is on multiple daily injection insulin regimen with appropriate total daily dose, she has poor compliance to her medication in addition to poor diet control with frequent hospital admissions due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Two years earlier, she had been investigated for delayed-bone-age short stature including growth hormone stimulation test which became sufficient. Despite her poor glycemic control, she had no evidence of nephropathy or retinopathy. The patient had no symptoms of hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, or polyglandular autoimmune disease; furthermore, no history suggestive of Celiac disease and its yearly screening test is within normal limit. The patient had no history of multiple joint pain, swelling, or hotness; no history of limping or morning stiffness; and no history of intermittent fever or weight loss. Family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus in both parents. However, no family history of microvascular complications and no arthropathy disease or rheumatological disorders.\n\n【11】Clinical examination showed 3 SDS short-stature pubertal female with stable vital signs. Hand inspection showed flexure contracture of both hands with thick, tight, waxy skin over the dorsal aspect of metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPJ) and interphalangeal joints (IPJ) with normal nail structure and color. Clinically, there was nontender swelling over both hands with no hotness or dislocated joints. Limited joint mobility was confirmed clinically with the “Prayer sign”  (written consent was signed by parents), manifested as incomplete approximation of all of the palmar surfaces of her both hands’ digits. She also had positive “table top” sign, not able to completely lay her palms flat on the horizontal surface of the flat table, with no clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease of the feet. The patient was clinically euthyroid with no thyromegaly and had no clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency or hypoparathyroidism excluding autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1(APS-1). No clinical stigmata of systemic lupus or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 “Prayer” sign showing the significant involvement of the JML of both hands limiting the palmar digits’ alignment on each other. The shiny tight skin over the digits is also shown.</u>\n\n【13】Retinal examination done by an ophthalmologist did not reveal any retinopathic changes.\n\n【14】Laboratory tests showed a high glycosylated hemoglobin c (HbA1c) level of 12.3%, normal thyroid function tests, and normal microalbumin test with urine albumin/creatinine of 20 mg/g. The patient had normal CBC with normal inflammatory markers.\n\n【15】As for management, the insulin total dose was increased by 15%, and the patient was offered a continuous glucose monitoring device to improve her glycemic control with strict follow-up visits to diabetic nutrition clinic to better manage her dietary intake. She was referred to pediatric orthopedic service for management of her hands’ limitation of movement and started on physiotherapy and occupation therapy to improve her hands’ range of motion and to increase her muscle strength and functional performance.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Our patient is having type 1 DM for more than 13 years, which is well known for its acute and chronic biochemical, pathophysiological, and functional complications; one of them is limited joint mobility LJM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although the differential diagnoses of joint involvement in female children are wide, most of the rheumatological, orthopedic, and systemic diseases were excluded in our patient based on the history, physical examination, and relevant laboratory tests. LJM has declined in frequency over two decades from 1970 till 1990 which was attributed to the better glycemic control offered by the availability of effective insulin therapy regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This child developed this complication after a long duration of diabetes. Diabetic children might have LJM as early as few months of onset of type 1 DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, compared to the late peak prevalence of LJM in 65% of DM generally after 30 years of onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. LJM was considered as a measure of the diabetes control quality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Our patient was having a high level of HbA1c as well as day to day home glucose readings, despite her adjusted insulin dose, indicating its correlation with chronic poor diabetes. Compared to our patient, we reported LJM in a 14-year-old male with chronically uncontrolled diabetes associated with celiac disease, receiving old mixed insulin regimen, yet he did not have evidence of retinopathy nor nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Despite the chronic poor control disease, our patient developed neither retinopathy nor nephropathy. Although literature is not conclusive in the LJM value as preceding the retinopathy and nephropathy, it is recommended to be part of clinical assessment of type 1DM patients as it might worn the presence of microvascular complications sooner. In different studies, they found significant association of LJM and later development of retinopathy and nephropathy in diabetic patients regardless of the duration of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Limitation of hand functionality in our patient manifested as restricted flexion and extension of the hand fingers which is explained by the connective tissue disturbance affecting the palmar aspects of the hands as mentioned in the literature. Our patient had positive findings in the two clinical tests of LJM; “Tabletop” sign with moderate severity and positive “Prayer” sign both tests are considered helpful tools in the clinical assessment. However, the prayer sign is more sensitive compared to the “Tabletop” because it detects the early pathological changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The growth failure is one of the features of poorly chronic diabetic children and adolescents. Our patient was short with poor growth velocity and had normal peak growth hormone level. However, poor glycemic control is affecting the growth hormone response at the tissue level. Oxford study found an association of LJM with growth impairment in chronic poorly controlled diabetic children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Our patient had long stay type 1 DM with persistent high HbA1c level, which was found to be significantly correlated with high serum concentrations of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) which is responsible for skin collagen glycation and consistent with the early appearance of LJM and its correlation with long-term control.\n\n【22】Although LJMS is considered as an irreversible disorder and has no curative therapeutic options, the main stay of treatment is symptomatic medications ranging from simple, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to local corticosteroid injections to relieve the pain and to decrease tendinitis or ameliorate the flexor tendon contractures. Surgical intervention is limited to severe contractures.\n\n【23】Physiotherapy intervention targeting stretching exercises of the palm of the hand and fingers will help to prevent progression of the joint stiffness in these cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. We targeted the patient management for better glycemic control and referred her to physiotherapy for management. Intensive glycemic control, physiotherapy for passive palmar stretching, and occupational therapy have shown to improve the range of movement and hand functionality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Generally, since LJM is an association or complication of chronic uncontrolled diabetes, the best preventive measure is to target well-controlled glycemic range and to involve the family to prepare the appropriate environment for this target starting from the early diagnosis stage.\n\n【25】Over the last two decades, many experimental studies on medications with AGE inhibitory properties targeting AGE cross-links have shown beneficial effects. However, human trials still need to prove the safety of these medications which are not in clinical use yet 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>.\n\n【26】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【27】We presented a child with bilateral hand limited joint mobility limitation as one of the rare type 1 DM complications as an important indicator of the microvascular complications in this age group, which mandates to be examined for during the outpatient visits of diabetic children for early detection and management. Good glycemic control with clear HbA1c and daily glucose range targets are still the mainstay of prevention of such complication and its associations. The available therapeutic options include symptomatic relief and hand’s function preservation through physiotherapy awaiting solid and extensive clinical trials to prove the safety and usefulness of the new AGE inhibitors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Multiple organs may be affected, including the nasal mucosa, skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. The following case highlights a unique manifestation of HHT in a patient with a gastrointestinal hemorrhage and epistaxis, resulting in hyperammonemia and diffuse cerebral edema and herniation. Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication in such patients and initiate ammonia-reducing agents early to avoid this devastating consequence.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), eponymously known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by widespread angiogenesis. HHT has a wide geographic and ethnic distribution. In North America and Europe, the prevalence is estimated to be 1:10,000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In geographically isolated populations, the prevalence of HHT is higher, such as an estimated 1:5000 in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and 1:1330 in the Afro-Caribbean islands of Curaçao and Bonaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, the true prevalence is likely underestimated, given its broad array of phenotypic presentations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】HHT is a clinical diagnosis, which has been codified by the Curaçao Criteria  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The presence of recurrent epistaxis is the most sensitive clinical manifestation of HHT, with average onset of epistaxis at 12 years and nearly 100% of patients affected by age 40. However, visceral lesions, which are the greatest contributor to HHT mortality, are often undetected and asymptomatic. The mortality rate increases with age, with the cumulative death rate at age 50 estimated to be 14% in one study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Thus, early HHT detection, screening, and intervention are essential for improving patient outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. HHT can be diagnosed by looking for specific genotypic mutations. Over 97% of patients with HHT possess mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4, which modulate TGF-β signaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. However, diagnosis is not contingent on the presence of these mutations.\n\n【5】Table 1 Curaçao Criteria for clinical diagnosis of HHT.\n\n【6】HHT’s most life-threatening manifestations arise in the form of visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which may result in high-output heart failure, portal hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic dysfunction are relatively common, and cohort imaging studies have shown that over two-thirds of patients with HHT possess hepatic AVMs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Hepatic AVMs in HHT rarely lead to hyperammonemia and resultant hepatic encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–19\\]</u>. This case illustrates the presentation of the first reported occurrence of subsequent transtentorial herniation as well as management strategies.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【8】A 64-year-old female with HHT presented to the hospital with a 24-hour history of nonbloody diarrhea and new onset hematemesis. Her HHT was diagnosed 40 years prior and had been complicated by refractory epistaxis, recurrent gastric bleeding from gastric ulcers and AVMs, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and hepatic AVMs resulting in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. She had been treated with steroids, danazol, doxycycline, aminocaproic acid, and bevacizumab and had undergone septodermoplasty and posterior nosebleed cauterizations. Most recently, she was receiving thalidomide 50 mg nightly with clinical improvement. She was also prescribed lactulose for her history of hepatic encephalopathy and iron supplementation. She had never smoked and did not drink alcohol.\n\n【9】On arrival to the emergency department, she had large volume hematemesis. She was hypotensive and tachycardic. On examination, she was lethargic but arousable. Her skin and conjunctiva were pale, and she had abdominal distension with generalized tenderness to palpation, along with melena and hematochezia on rectal exam. Her labs on admission were notable for a hemoglobin of 5.0 g/dL, platelet count of 103 k/µL, prothrombin time of 15.4 seconds, fibrinogen of 149 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 38 mg/dL. She had an ammonia level of 120 mmol/L. A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed, and the patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection and transferred to the intensive care unit where she received numerous transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBC), platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and cryoprecipitate. In addition, infusions of pantoprazole, octreotide, norepinephrine, and normal saline were given. Emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed at bedside showed a large volume of blood at the lower third of the esophagus and stomach, along with a few nonbleeding cratered gastric ulcers . Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, demonstrating extensive arteriovenous (AV) shunting from underlying vascular malformations in the liver, though there was no localizable source of bleeding .\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Endoscopy images showing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Although 3% hypertonic saline was started, serial CT scans demonstrated progressive worsening of the cerebral edema with impending transtentorial herniation 删除1:<u>(Figures 4(c) and 4(d))</u>.\n\n【17】Because her ammonia levels did not improve with pharmacologic management, she was started on renal replacement therapy (RRT) for the sole purpose of ammonia clearance, though this proved to have limited success. Eventually, a combination therapy of sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate, and L-arginine dropped her serum ammonia levels to a nadir of 31 µmol/L . Ornithine and phenylalanine amino acid levels were within reference ranges, ruling out an inborn disorder of the urea cycle.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Trend of ammonia level over the course of this patient’s hospital admission.

She required numerous blood products, and her bleeding slowly improved over the course of one week. While her ammonia normalized and serial imaging showed improvement in the cerebral edema, she remained in a persistent vegetative state and was ultimately transitioned to hospice.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】This case highlights the significant neurologic sequelae of uncontrolled gastric hemorrhage in an HHT patient with hepatic AVMs. The majority of HHT cases with hepatic involvement are asymptomatic, although some individuals can develop high-output cardiac failure, biliary ischemia, or portal hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. There are reports published in the literature of patients with HHT and hepatic AVMs who develop portosystemic shunting, hyperammonemia, and subsequent encephalopathy. However, the patients in these cases responded to treatment with lactulose, without reaching the level of acute decompensation and cerebral herniation seen in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 21\\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hyperammonemia-induced transtentorial herniation occurring in HHT.\n\n【22】When blood is digested following gastrointestinal hemorrhage, globin breakdown results in a rise in circulating amino acids and ammonia which are subsequently converted to urea by hepatocytes in the liver via the urea cycle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. However, for patients with impaired hepatic function, the liver is unable to efficiently convert ammonia to urea, which results in a toxic accumulation of ammonia. Ammonia is able to cross the blood-brain barrier where it is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase within cerebral astrocytes. Glutamine accumulation within astrocytes leads to increased osmotic pressure and cerebral edema, putting patients at risk for elevated intracranial pressure and cerebral herniation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Portosystemic encephalopathy due to hyperammonemia is rarely reported in HHT and has been attributed to the presence of hepatic AVMs. There are three categories of hepatic shunting that occur in patients with HHT, including those between the hepatic artery and hepatic vein; hepatic artery and portal vein; and the portal vein and hepatic vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Shunting between the portal vein and hepatic vein is the mechanism by which hepatic encephalopathy is thought to occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In patients with refractory GI bleeding and hepatic AVMs or cirrhosis, determining the optimum therapy to reduce a toxic accumulation of ammonia is paramount in reducing patient morbidity and mortality. Though there are no guidelines for RRT use in hyperammonemia, it appears to be a plausible treatment option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. However, as this case demonstrated, it may not always be efficacious. Another option is to facilitate removal of ammonia via the urea cycle. L-Arginine acts to increase the activity of N\\-acetylglutamate synthetase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-1, key enzymes within the urea cycle, by increasing the availability of L-citrulline and lessening hyperammonemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Sodium benzoate/sodium phenylacetate is a combination medication used in hyperammonemia. Its mechanism involves the conjugation of benzoate with glycine and phenylacetate with glutamine to yield hippuric acid and phenylacetylglutamine, respectively. Because glycine and glutamine contain nitrogen from ammonia, by combining these substances with benzoate and phenylacetate, their end-products can be renally excreted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26, 27\\]</u>. These treatments substantially reduce ammonia levels.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】This case uniquely demonstrates a neurologic catastrophe that may occur in patients with HHT who have hepatic AVMs and GI bleeding but also suggests potential treatment strategies that should be initiated early. Patients with hepatic AVMs may have a predisposition to encephalopathy after experiencing bleeding events, including GI bleeds and epistaxis. As this case illustrates, cerebral herniation can occur regardless of expedient management, but early treatment with amino acid therapy, RRT, rifaximin, and rectal lactulose should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In addition to clinical cues, noninvasive modalities can play an important role in characterization of these masses and therefore their diagnosis and management planning.

Advancements in these imaging modalities have led to tissue characterization and differentiation between different types of pathologies prior to their histological examination. In this case report, we describe the use of multimodality imaging techniques to differentiate between various forms of cardiac masses and how these helped in the diagnosis of the mass from the right ventricle.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A female patient in her 60s with a medical history of hypertension followed up with her primary care physician for an annual physical examination. Upon evaluation, the patient denied any complaints, and a review of the system was negative for any symptoms. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic murmur best heard at the apex. The rest of her examination and vitals were normal. The electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was ordered to evaluate the etiology of the systolic murmur which demonstrated moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and ejection fraction. A mobile, pedunculated mass was seen extending from the undersurface of the tricuspid annulus and traversing the pulmonic valve into the main pulmonary artery with mild right ventricular (RV) dilatation and hypokinesia . A gated computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest confirmed the RV mass with no evidence of pulmonary embolism or extra-cardiac extension . Patient was admitted for further evaluation and underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), which redemonstrated a large mobile and pedunculated mass measuring 8 by 3 cm in the RV protruding into the pulmonary artery (PA) during systole. The trans-gastric views demonstrated the attachment of the mass to the undersurface of the tricuspid annulus adjacent to the anterior tricuspid leaflet via a narrow stalk measuring 1.4 cm and extending 3-4 cm into the main pulmonary artery . The mass appeared lobulated with partial enhancement on injection of commercial echo contrast, thus helping us to exclude a thrombus. On cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), the mass was hypointense on the T1 sequence, had poor uptake on first-pass perfusion, and a heterogeneous uptake was on late gadolinium enhancement, which reflective of a benign tumor like myxoma . Given the large size, likely benign nature, and location of the tumor, the patient underwent surgical resection of the mass. Intraoperatively, the tumor was found to be soft and friable, extending into the PA, requiring dissection of the main PA to ensure complete retrieval of the mass into the right atrium . A partial tricuspid valve (TV) repair with an annuloplasty was also done. She had an uneventful course postoperatively. Patient has remained asymptomatic with no recurrence on follow-up echocardiogram 18 months after surgery.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Transthoracic echocardiogram showing RV mass.

Microscopically, the lesion consisted of bland cells in a basophilic matrix with a few spindle cells. No lipoblast or mitotic activity was noted.

Discussion\n\n【15】Cardiac masses are rare and may include tumors, thrombi, vegetations, or calcific lesions which unlike other organs can have severe hemodynamic consequences due to obstruction, embolism, electrical, or mechanical dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Cardiac myxomas are the most common benign primary cardiac neoplasm seen in adults. The majority arise from the left atrium attached to the interatrial septum with less than 5% ventricular in origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition to clinical cues, noninvasive cardiac imaging plays a major role in identification and diagnosis of cardiac masses. Basic measures such as TTE and TEE can help in the assessment of size, location, and mobility of a mass, and the added feature of 3-dimensional echocardiography can provide more accurate anatomical relationships. The addition of contrast agents can help assess the perfusion of the mass and differentiate between a thrombus (avascular) and a tumor (vascular) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In our patient the partially contrast-enhancing nature of the heterogeneous mass helped differentiate it as a tumor from a thrombus. TEE also helped in delineating anatomical relationships and guiding surgical access planning for retrieval of the mass.\n\n【16】Cardiac MRI with its tissue characterization and ability to provide information about extracardiac structures can help in assessing cardiac masses. First-pass perfusion to assess vascularity (high for vascular structures) and late gadolinium enhancement (absent in thrombus) can help to differentiate tumors from thrombus. T1 and T2 mapping along with other features can also help to differentiate between types of tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Cardiac CT can be used for more precise assessment of anatomical relations including extra-cardiac involvement but may not be required if other noninvasive measures are available. In our patient, heterogeneous late gadolinium enhancement, low first pass perfusion, and partial enhancement on injection of commercial echo contrast helped to exclude thrombus and identify the mass as a likely benign tumor as compared to a highly vascular lesion which has high first pass perfusion.\n\n【17】This case therefore not only describes a rare case of an incidental myxoma from the right ventricle but also shows how multimodality noninvasive imaging can be used to differentiate masses, aid in the management of these patients, and provide excellent correlation with histological diagnosis.\n\n【18】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】The imaging techniques guide in preoperative diagnosis and management of patients with an unidentified cardiac mass. Tissue characterization through multimodality imaging may provide an excellent correlation to the pathological diagnosis of a mass.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Endoscopy revealed that the structure measured 60 × 10 mm in the mucosa and the submucosa and had a heterogenous echo pattern. The esophageal mass was successfully resected by endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection. However, most esophageal lymphangiomas that are larger than 2 cm in diameter reported in the literature can be removed only through open surgery. Thus far, we know of no reported cases of endoscopic resection as a treatment for this case.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Lymphangioma of the esophagus is a benign cystic tumor, which is characterized by the presence of chylous or serous fluid within an irregularly dilated lymphatic channel. To date, it has been a rare clinical entity. Most esophageal lymphangiomas reported in the literature are smaller than 2 cm in diameter and can be removed using endoscopy. The present report describes a patient with lymphangioma of the esophagus. Endoscopy after admission revealed a 60 × 10 mm mass in the esophagus, which was then treated by endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection (EPMR).\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 41-year-old man was admitted to the neighborhood hospital because of dysphagia when eating for the past three months. The gastroscopy showed a submucosal mass in the distal esophagus. He was then transferred to our hospital on August 4, 2011, for further examination and treatment. The personal medical and family histories were unremarkable. There was no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, or weight loss, and the physical examination and standard laboratory tests were within normal limits.\n\n【6】The endoscopy after admission revealed a large, whitish-yellow, translucent mass with a lustrous surface in the mid and distal esophagus located 32 to 38 cm from the incisors 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. The mucosa was normal in appearance upon visualization. A later endoscopic biopsy specimen showed mild to moderate dysplasia of the lesion mucosa. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) demonstrated that there was a honeycomb-like hypoechoic structure measuring 60 × 10 mm located in the submucosa with a heterogeneous echo pattern and revealed that the muscularis propria was intact 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Endoscopic finding.

The esophageal mass was resected by EPMR on August 5, 2011. We used a needle and inserted it into the tumor body for suction, but there was no outflow of liquid. Then, the esophageal mass was removed using snare electrocautery after injecting the base of the mass with a mixed solution of saline and indigo carmine. The specimen was a cellular-like cystic structure, composed of jelly-like material. The superficial layers of the esophageal wall were clean and contained no significant bleeding 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(e)–1(h))</u>. The postendoscopic resection course was uneventful, and the patient was well 8 months after the endoscopic resection. Histology of the resected specimen showed cystically dilated lymphatics in the surface squamous epithelium and the submucosa, focally in the muscularis propria with lymphoid fluid in the lumen, and lymphoid aggregates in the stroma between the vessel walls, consistent with lymphangioma 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(i))</u>. No cysts or stromal tumors were identified. Gastroscopy after eight months showed the original excision wound formed a scar, and rebiopsy confirmed no lesion recurrence. Currently, the patient is still in follow-up.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Lymphangiomas are benign cystic tumors. They are characterized by the presence of chylous or serous fluid within an irregularly dilated lymphatic channel. Lymphangiomas may appear in any organ except the brain, although they commonly develop in the head and neck region, and only 1% are found in the GI tract. Of those that arise in the gut, the majority are found in the colon, followed in order of frequency by the stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The etiology of these tumors is not completely understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. They are thought to be a malformation or sequestration of lymphatic tissue that fails to communicate normally with the lymphatic system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Lymphangioma of the esophagus is a rare clinical entity. It was first reported by Watson-Williams in 1934 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, and Brady and Milligan were the first persons to diagnose it by endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Only 16 cases have been reported in the literature to date. The most common presenting symptoms are dysphagia, heartburn, postprandial vomiting, and epigastric pain. It can also present without any symptoms. Endoscopic Ultrasonography is the most important means of diagnosing. Submucosal tumors with multicystic echo pattern within the third layer or submucosa are considered characteristic of lymphangioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There are generally no difficulties in regard to the pathological diagnosis. Esophageal lymphangioma patients have a good prognosis. Asymptomatic patients do not necessarily need to have the tumor removed, but intervention should be considered when difficulty in swallowing develops or when a mass is suspected to be malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Common treatments include surgical resection, endoscopic resection, and carbon dioxide laser treatment. It was reported that treatment with a subcutaneous injection of interferon-2a resulted in a slight improvement in the dysphagia. Although it has side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>, the tumor size decreased, and good results were achieved because of its antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effect.\n\n【11】No cases of malignant transformation have been described because lymphangioma is a benign tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and gastrointestinal lymphangioma of malignant transformation has rarely been reported. Endoscopic resection was applied to the lesions involving the muscularis mucosa and submucosa. However, when the tumor involves the muscularis propria or if a malignant lesion is suspected, thoracic surgery should be performed. For the patient in the present study, preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated that the tumor was located in the submucosa, and endoscopic resection achieved good results. Thus, the choice of endoscopic ultrasound has an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal lymphangioma.\n\n【12】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【13】Our treatment has demonstrated that it is feasible and safe to enucleate lymphangioma even for large lesions. To the best of our knowledge, the endoscopic resection has the advantages of a short operation time, fewer injuries, and a rapid recovery. We believe that EPMR is a safe and sufficient method of therapy for esophageal lymphangioma lesions less than 5 cm in diameter and those located in the mucosa and submucosa.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) suppresses (NF)-κB, which is an important mediator of inflammation. BTZ is an established therapy against multiple myeloma (MM). Most of the adverse effects associated with bortezomib are mild to moderate and are generally manageable, including gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. BTZ-induced lung injury (BLI), although not appreciated during the introductory time of the medication, has now been highlighted in multiple case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–21\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Underlying mechanism of BLI is unclear but a proposed hypothesis is that BTZ withdrawal leads to rebound activation of (NF)-κB causing inflammatory changes in the lungs. This explains the rapid improvement of BLI with steroid therapy reported in several cases. But, there are a number of cases reported, which did not improve with steroid.

Case Report\n\n【7】A 64-year-old male with chronic low back pain presented to the emergency department with a new onset, severe mid back pain radiating to bilateral shoulders. CT scan, performed to rule out aortic dissection, demonstrated multiple lytic lesions throughout the bony skeleton and a compression fracture at T7 vertebral body with epidural extension of the soft tissue. A bone survey confirmed CT scan findings, and subsequent bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of MM. He received radiation therapy to the thoracic spine and completed 2 cycles of CyBorD regimen (cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> by mouth, BTZ 1.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneous, and dexamethasone 40 mg by mouth each on days 1, 8, 15, and 22). Three days after the completion of the second cycle, he was admitted to hospital with respiratory distress. CT chest  showed new interval appearance of bilateral perihilar ground-glass opacities and peribronchial and interstitial thickening predominantly in the upper lobes not seen in prior scan . There were no other signs or symptoms of pneumonia such as leukocytosis, fever, or cough. After some benefit from oral prednisone, he was discharged with a tapering dose of the same. Unfortunately, the patient was readmitted with worsening respiratory distress 4 days later. A repeat CT scan of the chest showed resolution of previously well-defined areas of perihilar ground-glass opacities but development of hazy areas of ground-glass opacification throughout both lungs with more confluent abnormalities in bilateral lower lobes . The patient was treated with high-dose methylprednisone and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation without any improvement. The family requested do-not-resuscitate and do-not-intubate status.

Methodology\n\n【12】We have reported a case and performed a review of current literature on BLI and statistical analysis of available data. Extensive PubMed search was performed to screen the literature using the search words “bortezomib” and “pulmonary injury,” “pulmonary toxicity,” “lung injury,” “lung toxicity,” “pneumonitis,” “pulmonary side effects,” “lung side effects,” “shortness of breath,” “breathlessness,” “dyspnea,” “ARDS,” or “respiratory failure.” BLI was defined as new onset of respiratory symptoms with new radiological finding without evidence of infection and other causes of respiratory symptoms including cardiac causes and other drug-related adverse effects. Respiratory symptoms included fever, dyspnea, cough, breathlessness, or respiratory failure. Radiological findings included any pulmonary infiltrate, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, ground-glass opacity, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, reticular shadowing, or features of pulmonary hypertension and interstitial pneumonitis. Eligible cases from the literature were included in the review.\n\n【13】#### 4\\. Results\n\n【14】An extensive PubMed search yielded 35 events of BLI, 5 of which occurred with readministration of BTZ after resolution of initial BLI. The mean (standard deviation SD, minimum, maximum) age is 61.14 years (9.93, 31, 78) and 65.71% were male. 14.29% had current or past smoking history, 17.24% had history of lung disease, and 31.43% had prior SCT for MM. 14.29% received steroid just prior to or along with bortezomib. 14.29% were receiving concurrent chemotherapy. The mean total BTZ dose was 4.41 mg (2.75, 1, 9), mean duration from the first dose to the onset of BLI was 20.59 days (16.59, 0.5, 60), and the mean duration from the last dose to onset of BLI was 3.08 days (2.77, 0, 10). 37.14% of BLIs were fatal.\n\n【15】The t\\-test showed no significant difference in mean age, mean number of BTZ doses, and mean duration from the 1<sup>st</sup> dose of BTZ to the onset of BLI between deceased and survivors. But, the difference in mean duration (SD, minimum, maximum) from the last dose of BTZ to the onset of BLI between deceased (1.59 days (SD, 0, 5)) and survivors (3.95 days (SD, 0, 10)) were found to be statistically significant () Table 1. 45.45% deceased had prior SCT compared to 11.11% deceased who had no stem cell transplant (). No significant association could be found between the outcome of BLI and various factors like sex, previous lung diseases, history of smoking, concurrent/prior steroids, and treatment of BLI with steroids Table 2.\n\n【16】Table 1 Comparison of age, total BTZ dose, time from first dose of BTZ, and time from last dose of BTZ between those who survived and those who died ().\n\n【17】Table 2 Outcome based on individual categorical variables: sex, new/relapsed/refractory type, prior SCT, smoking, previous lung injury, steroid just prior to BTZ, and concurrent chemotherapy ().\n\n【18】#### 5\\.

BLI is a serious yet underappreciated adverse effect of BTZ associated with a high mortality rate of 37.14% as suggested by our analysis of reported cases available. Some initial case reports suggested a mortality rate as high as 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In one phase IV clinical study of 666 patients who had received bortezomib published by Narimatsu et al. 3.6% of pulmonary complications and 0.5% of total deaths were attributed to these complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Some studies have shown that genetic predisposition to BLI, especially with Japanese population, and history of prior SCT might be risk factors for BLI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9, 21\\]</u>. Some cases responded very well to steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, while others did not. Our patient responded to steroid to some extent and was discharged. He later presented with worsening pulmonary symptoms and died. It is important to establish the dose and duration of steroid for the patients who respond to therapy. For others who do not respond to steroid, there is a need to identify other mechanisms of BLI, so that appropriate treatment may be directed. Clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion for BLI, as it can be misjudged as other more common respiratory conditions. Appropriate supportive management along with steroids and immediate withdrawal of BTZ should be the primary management strategy.\n\n【20】Our study showed that fatal BLIs were associated with early onset after the last dose of BTZ (with mean 1.59 days vs. 3.95 days among nonfatal BLI) and with history of prior SCT. No significant association could be found between the outcome of BLI and various factors like sex, previous lung diseases, history of smoking, concurrent/prior steroid intake, concurrent steroid as a part of chemotherapy regimens, and steroid administered to treat BLI. Small sample size, retrospective nature of the study, and analysis of composite data from the reported cases in the PubMed are major limitations of the study.\n\n【21】Carfilzomib (CFZ) is an irreversible, second-generation selective proteasome inhibitor that is used to treat relapsed or refractory MM. In July 2012, the FDA granted approval of carfilzomib for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug and who have shown disease progression while on therapy or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. In the ASPIRE study (a phase III trial of CFZ plus lenalidomide (R) and dexamethasone (D) vs. RD only in relapsed MM) and the ENDEAVOR study (a phase III trial of CFZ plus D vs. bortezomib plus D in relapsed MM), there was slightly higher incidence of all-grade dyspnea in the CFZ arm compared to respective controls (29 versus 13 percent) and cough (25 versus 14 percent), but there were no BLI-like noninfectious progressive lung injuries reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. According to FDA-approved manufacturer’s prescribing information, carfilzomib was associated with development of pulmonary hypertension in 2% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Severe pulmonary hypertension (grade ≥ 3) was in less than 1%.\n\n【22】Based on our literature review, only 5 case reports of CFZ-associated noninfectious progressive lung injury have been identified. In one of the reported cases, the patient presented with dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and a dry cough after the second dose of CFZ which got worse with subsequent dose until CFZ was discontinued. A CT chest revealed diffuse bilateral ground-glass micronodular opacities and increased reticular markings. The pulmonary function test showed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect, with severely reduced diffusion capacity and desaturation to 84% on exertion. Symptoms and CT scan finding improved after oral prednisone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. In other case report, the patient developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. After a week, the patient developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and despite aggressive supportive care, the patient died after three weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. The third case report was also about fatal pulmonary hemorrhage after CFZ. The patient had developed acute dyspnea within 2-3 hours of first dose of CFZ, along with infiltrates on chest X-ray. Symptoms resolved after corticosteroid and bronchodilators along with resolution of X-ray finding next day. The patient was subsequently treated five scheduled doses without any problem. After about a month, when second cycle of CFZ was given, the patient again developed acute dyspnea, with no resolution of symptoms. The patient later died of pulmonary hemorrhage despite aggressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Recent case series reported one case of pulmonary hypertension after CFZ and other case of dyspnea with lung disease with pulmonary function test showing significantly decreased unadjusted diffusion capacity of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. With increasing use of CFZ, more information may emerge regarding the CFZ-associated lung injuries in future.\n\n【23】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】BLI is a serious condition with a mortality rate of 37.14%. Early onset of BLI from the last dose of BTZ and prior SCT can be the predictors of mortality. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. Limited data have emerged on the possible association of CFZ with various lung injuries. Clinicians should be mindful of this potentially fatal adverse effect of proteasome inhibitors like BTZ or CFZ.\n\n【25】#### Abbreviations\n\n| BTZ: | Bortezomib |\n| --- | --- |\n| BLI: | BTZ-induced lung injury |\n| SCT: | Stem cell transplant |\n| SD: | Standard deviation. |\n\n【27】#### Disclosure\n\n【28】This case report was accepted as “online only” abstract in ASH Annual Meeting 2014.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Even though it is recognized that every type or size of vessel can be affected in this disease, there is an inability to describe a coherent model that sufficiently explains the predilection of certain patients with BD for manifesting severe large vessel thrombosis. The inconsistent epidemiologic data and the complex genetic background of BD, along with the controversy of multiple international studies regarding the coexistence of thrombophilia in patients with BD and large vessel thrombosis, make us think that a percentage of these patients may actually suffer from a distinct clinical entity. The stimulus for this concept arose from the clinical observation of three male patients who were admitted to our clinic due to extended vena cava thrombosis. On the occasion of those clinically and laboratory resembling cases, we performed a literature review concerning the epidemiology of BD, associated thrombosis, and coexistent thrombophilic factors, in order to present some evidence, which sustains our hypothesis that certain patients with large vessel thrombosis, who share features of BD and coexistent thrombophilia, should actually be further investigated for the possibility of suffering from a distinct nosological entity.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Behçet’s disease (BD), which is also acknowledged as Adamantiades-Behçet’s disease, is classically defined as a chronic multisystemic vasculitis affecting vessels of any type or size and it is mostly characterized by recurrent mucocutaneous and ocular lesions. Over the last few years, the studies conducted on the pathophysiology of BD demonstrated its common characteristics with the group of autoinflammatory diseases. As a result, nowadays, many authors prefer to use an alternative term that defines BD as a chronic, relapsing, and multisystem autoinflammatory disorder of unknown etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Despite the international concern and the copious researches on BD, no pathognomonic laboratory finding or diagnostic test has yet been validated and the diagnosis of the disease remains a clinical decision. Over 15 different sets of criteria for the diagnosis of BD have been proposed but the most commonly used are the criteria of the International Study Group (ISG) which were created in 1990 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and the Japanese criteria that were revised by the Behçet’s Disease Research Committee of Japan in 2003 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】According to the ISG criteria, the diagnosis of BD requires the presence of recurrent oral ulceration plus any two of genital ulceration, typical defined eye lesions, typical defined skin lesions, or a positive pathergy test . In one study of pediatric BD, the average period length between the initial oral ulceration and the second major manifestation was 8.8 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The Japanese criteria are divided into major and minor manifestations and were created in order to avoid overdiagnosis of BD. The disease is classified as complete, incomplete, possible, or specific type, based on the combination of those manifestations . The ISG criteria emphasize the oral aphthosis and a positive pathergy test, but they do not consider other important site-specific manifestations such as the vascular lesions, which in certain cases can be the initial presentation of BD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. On the other hand, the Japanese criteria embody most of the site-specific manifestations, denominating three particular types of BD (neuro-, intestinal-, and vasculo-BD), but the diagnosis of the complete type of BD requires the presence of all the 4 predominant manifestations of BD. Therefore, although both sets of diagnostic criteria provide a useful diagnostic tool for the clinicians, they cannot ensure case ascertainment.\n\n【5】Table 1 Diagnostic criteria of the International Study Group for Behçet’s disease 通用删除7(英):<u>(1990)</u>.\n\n【6】Table 2 Diagnostic criteria of the Behçet’s Disease Research Committee of Japan (2003 revision).\n\n【7】BD presents a significant inhomogeneity in clinical features, in the reported prevalences of the specific types, in gender predominance, and in genetic and immunological findings, vastly depending on which geographic region or ethnicity is studied. Thereafter, the inconsistent presentation of BD raises the question whether this is the result of a multifactorial interaction or if there is a possibility that what we call Behçet’s disease is to be constituted by a group of overlapping separate diseases. In this paper, we initially describe three cases with major vein thrombosis from which the first was diagnosed as complete vasculo-BD, the second was diagnosed as possible vasculo-BD, and the third was diagnosed as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to multifactorial thrombophilia. On the occasion of those three clinically and laboratory resembling cases, we performed a literature review concerning the epidemiology of BD, associated thrombosis, and coexistent thrombophilic factors, in order to support our hypothesis that BD might not represent a unique clinical entity and that in certain patients with large vessel thrombosis, who present some features of BD and coexistent thrombophilic factors, the possibility of suffering from a distinct nosological entity should be further investigated.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Subjects and Methods\n\n【9】Three cases with vena cava thrombosis were studied. Demographic characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, radiologic imaging, laboratory and thrombophilic testing, treatment, and outcome were recorded.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【11】Three adult Caucasian males of Greek origin aged 32, 54, and 20 (patients A, B, and C, resp.) were admitted to our Department of Internal Medicine due to large vessel thrombosis. All of the three patients had free medical history.\n\n【12】##### 3.1. Clinical, Laboratory, and Imaging Assessments\n\n【13】Patient A. A 32-year-old male was admitted to our department with complaints of dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, and persisting low-grade fever starting a month ago. On initial evaluation, the patient had facial edema and distended jugular and upper chest veins. Additionally, tongue, gingival, and scrotal aphthous ulcers were observed. The patient confirmed the presence of recurrent oral aphthosis the last semester, which was painful and self-limited. A nodular episcleritis of the left eye was observed during ocular examination and pathergy test was positive, while no other cutaneous manifestations were observed. Digital subtraction angiography revealed an extended thrombosis of the superior vena cava (SVC) and the right subclavian vein and the creation of a collateral pathway through the azygos vein . Further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (triplex) showed a sizeable (3 cm) pedunculated thrombus, which was oscillating in the right atrium . Laboratory findings were characterized by moderately elevated inflammatory markers and mild normochromic anemia, while the immunological tests identified the HLA-B\\51 haplotype and enhanced C4 complement titer, with negative results for the autoantibodies testing . The patient was assessed for thrombophilic factors and was found to be homozygous carrier for the C677T polymorphism of the 5,10-methylene-tetrahydro-folate reductase (MTHFR) mutation, but serum homocysteine was within the normal range .\n\n【14】Table 3 Laboratory findings of our patients at presentation.\n\n【15】Table 4 Results of the thrombophilia testing in our patients.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Digital subtraction angiography (iv-DSA) of superior vena cava (SVC) in patient A showing the extended SVC and right subclavian vein thrombosis along with the establishment of collateral flow through the azygos vein. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Transesophageal echocardiogram (Triplex) in patient A showing a sizeable (3 cm) pedunculated thrombus, which was oscillating in the right atrium (RA). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【18】Patient B. A 54-year-old male was referred to our department from a vascular surgery clinic due to a recently diagnosed inferior vena cava thrombosis. Patient’s history was remarkable for a 7-month bilateral and gradually ascending deep vein thrombosis of the lower limps; despite the fact that ever since he was diagnosed with the initiatory left popliteal vein thrombosis, he was treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), used at therapeutic dose. Clinically, the patient had painful aphthous ulcers on the lips, gingiva, and oral cavity, characterized by frequent recurrence over the past 2 years. An ocular test was unremarkable; however, the pathergy test was positive although no other cutaneous lesions were observed. The patient had had triplex ultrasound repeated over the last months, which showed the bilateral and scaling course of the thrombosis of the large vessels of the lower limps, the iliac and the femoral veins , and the inferior vena cava. A computed tomography scan with IV contrast confirmed the sonographic findings. Laboratory assessment revealed elevated inflammatory markers and C3 complement titer, mild normochromic anemia, and positive HLA-B\\51 type, while the results of the autoantibodies were all negative . Moreover, the patient was found to be positive in several thrombophilic factors as he was heterozygous carrier of MTHFR C677T and FV-Leiden R506Q mutations with associated severe hyperhomocysteinemia .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Triplexultrasound in patient B showing the thrombosis of the right common femoral vein (CFV).

A 20-year-old male was admitted to our department for a three-week continuous low back and thigh pain, accompanied by local tenderness, warmth and erythema, and a two-week fever. One month before his admission, the patient had been hospitalized in a vascular surgery clinic, where the diagnosis of inferior vena cava thrombosis was made, with an expansion of the thrombus to the ileac and the femoral veins bilaterally. He had been discharged with LMWH, prescribed at therapeutic dose. On examination, he was febrile up to 38.3°C and tenderness was present in iliac fossa and thigh bilaterally and especially left, with no other notable findings. The oral cavity and scrotum were free of any aphthous or herpetiform ulcers and cutaneous manifestations were absent; however, the patient mentioned the occurrence of two episodes of painless, self-limited aphthous ulcers in the last 9 months. An ocular test was unremarkable and the pathergy test was negative. A CT angiography was performed showing unchanged thrombosis of the inferior vena cava, ileac, spermatic, and femoral vein and the creation of a collateral pathway, along with a significant degree of perivascular inflammation . Laboratory exams revealed highly elevated inflammatory markers, slightly enhanced IgA and C4 complement titer, mild normochromic anemia, and prolonged partial thromboplastin time as well as the identification of HLA-B\\51 and B\\27 haplotypes . Screening for autoantibodies was negative. Thrombophilia testing showed a positive low titer lupus anticoagulant (LAC) and a borderline hyperhomocysteinemia, while the patient was also found to be heterozygous carrier of MTHFR C677T and FV-Leiden R506Q mutations .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Computed tomographic angiography in patient C showing the thrombosis of the inferior vena cava along with a significant degree of perivascular inflammation. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【22】##### 3.2. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【23】In all the three cases, no evidence of infection, an underlying malignancy, or any other systemic vasculitis was documented by the clinical, imaging, and laboratory assessments. The main diagnostic findings of the three patients are summarized in Table 5.\n\n【24】Table 5 Synopsis of the three patients’ diagnostic assessment.\n\n【25】Patient A. The occurrence of recurrent oral aphthosis, genital ulceration, and a positive pathergy test established the diagnosis of BD according to the ISG criteria. It is worth noting that his ocular finding (unilateral nodular episcleritis) has been reported as a rare BD finding but it is not included in the eye lesions in the diagnostic sets of criteria for BD.\n\n【26】Patient B. Hisclinical assessment included recurrent oral aphthosis and a positive pathergy test, which could not establish Behçet’s diagnosis according to the ISG criteria, but the implementation of the Japanese criteria of 2003 could not exclude a Behçet’s diagnosis in this case. HLA-B\\51 positivity, acute phase response, and predominantly the deteriorating vascular lesions, even though he was receiving antithrombotic therapy with LMWH at therapeutic dose, supported the diagnosis of a possible type of BD. The main differential diagnosis in this patient was paraneoplastic thrombosis but the failure of the 7-month LMWH therapy in combination with the extended CT scanning and the gastrointestinal endoscopy did not provide evidence of any underlying malignancy. Likewise, it is doubtful whether the coexistence of three thrombophilic factors can itself explain his deteriorating clinical course, considering he was under sufficient antithrombotic therapy.\n\n【27】Patient C. His diagnostic assessment was remarkable for the coexistence of several different thrombophilic factors. A possible diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome was assumed but the reexamination in 6 and 12 weeks later did not detect the lupus anticoagulant. From the clinical assessment, even though he mentioned recurrent oral aphthosis, this manifestation was not observed by any physician and could not be evaluated. His laboratory findings were noticeable for the acute phase response and positivity in HLA-B\\51&B\\27, which, combined with the intense perivascular inflammation in CT angiography, posed the question whether all these findings were the result of the multifactorial thrombophilia and the extended thrombosis alone or if another inflammatory disorder was present. A biopsy of the small saphenous vein was performed and the pathology report described normal findings with no presence of inflammation or clot formation. The patient was also tested for JAK mutations with negative results.\n\n【28】##### 3.3. Treatment and Outcome\n\n【29】Patient A. He was treated with oral immunosuppressants (methylprednisolone plus azathioprine) and anticoagulant agents (LMWH was administered at therapeutic dose for 3 days, followed by acenocoumarol with an INR target of 3–3.5). A successful surgical removal of the right atrium thrombus was performed, along with an SVC and brachiocephalic vein biopsy. The pathology report of those specimens described clot in incipient organization, inflammatory, and reactive lesions, findings which were compatible with vasculitis. He was discharged with a prescription of oral azathioprine, methylprednisolone with tapering dosage, aspirin, acenocoumarol, folic acid, and colchicine only during the occurrence of oral ulcerations. Clinical improvement was obtained in 1 month with a decrease of the inflammatory markers within the normal range. In a period of 6 months, the thromboses partially subsided, with complete resolution of the thrombi and vessel recanalization in 24 months. No signs of a relapse were observed during the 11-year follow-up, apart from the sporadic oral aphthosis.\n\n【30】Patient B. On admission, LMWH was discontinued and he was given acenocoumarol therapy with an INR target of 3–3.5. Soon after the completion of the initial diagnostic procedures, oral immunosuppressants (methylprednisolone plus azathioprine), colchicine, and folic acid per os were added in his medication. One month later, significant clinical improvement was observed with a decrease in the inflammatory markers within normal range. He was discharged with a prescription of oral azathioprine, methylprednisolone with tapering dosage, acenocoumarol, folic acid, and colchicine only during the occurrence of oral ulcerations. CT angiography of the IVC was performed in the 2-month follow-up revealing considerable remission of the thromboses with sufficient blood flow and partial recanalization of the IVC and the iliac veins. Complete clinical remission was observed in the total 6-month follow-up.\n\n【31】Patient C. He was treated with anticoagulant agents, which included LMWH at therapeutic dose followed by oral acenocoumarol with an INR target of 3–3.5. Folic acid was also added to his medication. Patient’s inflammatory markers gradually decreased within normal range, and the fever subsided during his hospitalization without any anti-inflammatory medication. A CT angiography prior to his discharge showed the subsidence of the perivascular inflammation but no improvement of the thrombosis. Patient’s assessment did not confirm any of the hallmark manifestations of BD, and he was discharged with a prescription of oral acenocoumarol. In the total 7-month follow-up, the patient presented distention of the abdominal veins due to the IVC obstruction, while his repeated imaging assessment, which included ultrasonography, computed tomography angiography, and magnetic resonance venography, has not shown sufficient subsidence of the DVT and IVC thrombosis. During the follow-up, examination for lupus anticoagulant was negative and no sign of any underlying malignancy or systemic vasculitis was evidenced from the elaborate clinical, laboratory, and imaging assessment.\n\n【32】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【33】##### 4.1. Epidemiology of Behçet’s Disease\n\n【34】Although there is evidence for a global incidence, BD is more prevalent in the Far East, Middle East, and Eastern Mediterranean basin, following the pattern of the old silk trading routes, whereas it is rarely encountered in Northern Europe, Northern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and America 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The highest prevalence of BD is observed in Turkey with 420 cases per 100,000 population, while reported estimates vary from 13.5–22 cases per 100,000 population in Japan, Korea, China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>, and between 0.12 and 7.5 per 100,000 population in Europe and the US 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. However, the epidemiology cannot be scaled with accuracy, since the worldwide reported prevalences of BD are strongly influenced by the miscellaneous diagnostic sets of criteria that are applied in every country. There is a general estimation that BD occurs roughly equally in both sexes, with a worse prognosis and a more severe course of the disease in men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Nevertheless, there are several reports showing a divergent gender predominance of BD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. In the Middle East, there are reports indicating a male predominance of BD, with male-to-female ratios of 3.8 : 1 in Israel and 5.3 : 1 in Egypt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Quite the opposite, in the United States there is a predominance of the females, with a female-to-male ratio of 5 : 1, whilst in Germany, Japan, and Brazil, the disease is slightly more common in females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. As far as the age of BD onset is concerned, the symptoms typically occur in the late third and early fourth decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Juvenile BD is rather unusual, representing 3% to 7% of all cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【35】The pathogenesis of the disease remains uncertain. It is believed that genetic, autoimmune end environmental factors interact with each other. Historically, the most consistent association is with HLA-B\\51 gene (chromosome 6p21) although the third of BD patients do not possess this gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The geographic distribution of this gene is concomitant to the prevalence of BD in specific latitudes, namely, between 30° and 45° North 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In particular, in countries in the southern hemisphere and in Europe above 45° North the prevalence of HLA-B\\51 in healthy individuals is nil or low (1–10%), in countries in Central Europe its prevalence is intermediate (11–15%), and in countries in the eastern Mediterranean basin and in Middle East its prevalence is high (>15%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Other MHC associations with BD include tumor necrosis factor (TNF), the heat shock protein (HSP) family, and the MHC class I chain gene A (MICA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Moreover, 16 different non-HLA susceptibility loci were identified in whole-genome screening as being associated with the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The environmental factors that have been most implicated in triggering the inception of BD are infectious agents such as Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Streptococcus sanguinis, S. oralis, S. mitis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 23, 25\\]</u>.\n\n【36】The most intriguing feature in the epidemiologic study of BD concerns the regional variation of its clinical expression, especially regarding the neurological, vascular, and intestinal manifestations of BD. In the case of neuro-BD, the reported percentages range from 1.3% to 59% in hospital-based series and 5.3% to 14.3% in three prospective studies from Turkey, Iran, and Iraq 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Similarly, gastrointestinal involvement in BD has been frequently reported in Japan (50–60%), United Kingdom (38–53%), and Taiwan (32%), whereas it is rare in Turkey (3%), Saudi Arabia (4%), and Jordan (5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Lastly, the same disparity is presented in the reported prevalences of vascular BD, which is frequent in Saudi Arabia (34%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> and Turkey (14.3–26%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 30\\]</u> and lower in Iran (8.3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u> and Japan (6%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. However, we must notice that the lack of case definition can partially explain the deviant reported prevalences. For instance, in the case of vascular BD, there is no consensus concerning the lesions that should be included in the clinical vascular characteristics of BD. Therefore, in Japan, patients with superficial thrombophlebitis are excluded from studies that examine the frequency of vascular involvement in BD, since this lesion is categorized as a skin manifestation according to the Japanese criteria.\n\n【37】##### 4.2. Epidemiology of Vasculo-Behçet’s Disease and Coexistent Thrombophilic Factors\n\n【38】The term “vasculo-Behçet,” which is included in the specific types of BD according to the Japanese criteria of 2003, is used in order to identify that subcategory of the patients with BD who have a tendency to develop large vessel lesions, often with an additive and progressive course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. The frequency of the vascular involvement among patients with BD ranges from 7.7 to 38% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The lesions involve mainly the veins (29% of BD cases) and less frequently the arteries (8–16% of BD cases) and include vasculitis, thrombosis, and aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Thrombosis represents the most usual manifestation, whereas the rupture of a pulmonary artery aneurysm consists the leading cause of death in vasculo-BD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the precise worldwide prevalences of large vein thrombosis in BD could not be recorded in this literature review because the majority of the international studies examine the large vessel involvement as a whole and they do not use a common and clear case definition. In contrast, cardiac involvement with clinical implication is rather unusual, since the reported incidence range from 1% to 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. Cardiac manifestations mainly include coronary aneurysms, pericarditis, endocarditis, myocarditis, and predominantly right-sided intracardiac thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【39】The pathophysiology of vascular thrombosis in BD is not well understood. It is generally accepted that the triggering feature in the thrombogenesis process is the vascular inflammation. However, the presence of large vessel thrombosis only in certain patients with BD implies that other additional factors are required for the development of a thrombotic event. La Regina et al. proposed that thrombogenesis in BD can be explained through the concept of Virchow’s triad of venous thrombosis (abnormal blood flow, abnormal vessel wall, and abnormal blood constituents) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Several abnormal blood constituents have been implicated in the thrombogenesis in BD, with an emphasis given in certain procoagulant factors (factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutations, MTHFR polymorphisms, hyperhomocysteinemia, and antiphospholipid antibodies), but the results of the related researches are controversial ; Gül et al. found a positive association between FV Leiden and FII G20210A mutations with venous thrombosis in BD in Turkish patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>, whereas Silingardi et al. did not confirm these results in Italian patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Karakus et al. reported that homozygosity of MTHFR C677T was significantly higher in BD patients than in healthy controls in Turkish patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, but Ricart et al. did not find such an association in patients from eastern Spain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Shahram et al. found significantly higher homocysteine levels in Iranian patients with BD and thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, whereas Leiba et al. found homocysteine levels within normal range among Israeli patients with BD and thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Lastly, no association was found between anticardiolipin antibodies titres and vascular involvement in BD in Turkish patients by Tokay et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, while statistically significant presence of aCL was reported in patients with BD in an Italian study by Hull et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Table 6 Prevalence of the procoagulant factors in the general population, in patients with BD, and in patients with BD and thrombosis.\n\n【42】All these conflicting data get even more perplexing if we further examine the factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin 20210A mutations. FVL is mainly encountered in Caucasians, with an average prevalence of 5%, and increases the risk of venous thrombosis 3- to 8-fold for heterozygous carriers and 50- to 80-fold for homozygous carriers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The Mediterranean region presents the highest prevalence of FVL in the world, while FVL is very rare or absent in non-Caucasian ethnic groups (Africans, South-East Asians, Chinese, Japanese, American Indians, Greenland Eskimos, and Aboriginals of Australia) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Likewise, FII 20210A mutation is met only in Caucasians with an average prevalence of 2-3% and increases the risk of venous thrombosis 3-fold 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The highest prevalence of FII 20210A is encountered in the Southern Europe, in the Mediterranean region and in the Middle East 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 37\\]</u>.\n\n【43】These epidemiologic data point out that the highest prevalences of both these inherited procoagulant factors are quite proportional to the highest epidemiologic prevalences of vasculo-BD, posing the question whether it is a coincidental coexistence or if there is a genetic association. Trying to answer this question, we examined random studies from literature review concerning the association between BD, FVL, and FII 20210A mutations. As we have noticed previously, FVL and FII 20210A are absent in Japan but prevalent in Turkey ( % and 0.7–8.0%, resp.) and in Lebanon ( % and 1.3–3.6%, resp.) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37, 38\\]</u>. Assuming that the reports of Gül et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u> indicate that FVL and FII 20210A mutations are genetically associated with BD and act synergistically with the tenderness of BD for thrombotic events, one could say that this is one reason that explains why the prevalence of vascular BD is lower in Japan ( %) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u> and higher in Turkey ( –26%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 30\\]</u> and in Lebanon ( .8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Consequently, we should expect that this correlation applies in Italy and in Spain as well, where FVL and FII 20210A mutations are also frequently encountered; nevertheless, the studies from Silingardi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and Espinosa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u> did not find such a positive association between those thrombophilic mutations and BD in Italian and Spanish patients, respectively.\n\n【44】##### 4.3. Epicrisis\n\n【45】The main argumentations for the inconsistency of clinical, laboratory, and genetic findings in BD are the multifactorial interaction in the pathogenesis of the disease and the lack of case ascertainment, which in many patients result in an inappropriate diagnosis of a possible or an incomplete type of BD. Therefore, the worldwide studies may present a discrepancy in their results, on account of the fact that the experimental groups embody several subjects who actually do not suffer from BD. But then, in all these patients that present only certain features of BD, which is the nature of their actual disease? In a recently published paper, which was brought to our knowledge while writing this paper, Yazici et al. pose a similar questioning about the heterogeneity of BD and reach the conclusion that BD may actually represent more than one condition, underlining three more crucial parameters of BD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. The first is that a Mendelian inheritance pattern does not seem to exist among the adult patients, whereas an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern has been suggested for the pediatric patients. The second is that a differing response of different clinical manifestations is encountered to one same drug. The third and most essential parameter is that two discrete symptom clusters can be recognized in BD at the present time, the acne and arthritis cluster and the vascular cluster, in which, the dural sinus thrombosis of neuro-BD and the superficial vein thrombosis, the deep vein thrombosis, and the pulmonary artery involvement of vasculo-BD all seem to be clustered in BD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.\n\n【46】In the aforementioned three male patients, clinical presentation was dominated from the extended vena cava thrombosis. Their laboratory assessment revealed elevated inflammation markers, HLA-B\\51 positivity, and several coexisting thrombophilic factors. Their thrombophilia was not enough to interpret their deteriorating large vessel thrombosis considering the failure of the anticoagulant therapy to prevent the expansion of the thrombosis. The exclusion of infectious and malignant causes suggested the possibility of an underlying autoimmune or autoinflammatory mechanism as a contributory factor in the lasting thrombogenesis process. Despite the absence of typical for BD ocular manifestations, the diagnostic assessment showed that this factor was BD in patient A and most probably in patient B as well, taking into consideration his direct response to the use of immunosuppressant agents. In patient C the lack of definite oral ulceration and a negative pathergy test or other clinical manifestations led us in a diagnostic stalemate.\n\n【47】The inconsistent and frequently contradictory features of BD, especially regarding vasculo-BD and coexistent thrombophilic factors that were presented previously, demonstrate the significant heterogeneity of this disease, leading us to the hypothesis that a lot of patients who are diagnosed as suffering from BD might not have the same disease but different overlapping clinical entities. We further assume that patients who present large vessel thrombosis, coexistent thrombophilic factors, and some BD features, for instance oral aphthosis and HLA-B\\51 positivity, may actually suffer from a distinct nosological entity . In this clinical entity, the complex interaction among genetic loci could be explained with the phenomenon of epistasis. Epistasis, which is usually found in the human major histocompatibility complex genes, is a genetic term that was invented from William Bateson, who observed that, in some dihybrid crosses, not all possible phenotypic classes were observed and/or that some gene combinations resulted in novel phenotypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. The concept of synergistic epistasis could theoretically answer the question why certain patients with BD have a specific tendency for large vessel thrombosis. Besides, the existence of such a distinct nosological entity, which shares some features of the complex spectrum of BD, could explain why certain only international studies confirm a significant association between BD and specific thrombophilic factors, as well as why the frequency of vascular thrombosis in BD is lower in Japan, where some factors such as V Leiden and II G20210A mutations are absent.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | Our hypothesis of a distinct nosological entity evolves patients who present some features of the complex spectrum of BD and various thrombophilic factors. The synergistic epistasis in this pathologic pathway results in large vessel thrombosis of those patients. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【49】Nevertheless, there is a range of limitations to this medical hypothesis that need to be acknowledged. The three cases presented in this paper comprise a negligible sample in order to reach definite conclusions. Furthermore, the relatively short duration of follow-up in patients B and C (less than a year) must be taken into consideration, since we cannot rule out the possibility that another known cause of thrombosis might be clinically evidenced in the forthcoming period. Besides, apart from the malignancies and the established immunological causes of thrombosis (systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, and BD), current evidence suggests that many other defined autoimmune disorders and immune-mediated diseases are closely associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. Finally, even if the hypothesis of this paper was verifiable, it still seems that this theoretical model of venous thrombosis could not explain every single case of large vessel thrombosis in BD, given that in certain international studies it is demonstrated that thrombosis in BD can occur in spite of the absence of—at least all identified—thrombophilic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 14, 40\\]</u>.\n\n【50】Consequently, it is unquestionable that our hypothesis for the potential existence of a distinct nosological entity, which entails a genetic linkage between thrombophilia and a novel inflammatory condition that shares certain features of BD, cannot be documented only by the aforementioned cases and the analysis of the preexisting literature. Further studies are required, in order to determine if there is indeed a subgroup of patients with large vessel thrombosis, coexistent thrombophilia, and poor response to the anticoagulant therapy and at the same time they do present certain other common clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of BD. Moreover, the thrombotic phenomenon in these distinct overlapping clinical entities may emphasize the necessity of studying the coagulation physiology in combination with the immune response as it is studied in basic sciences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Recently, the term immunothrombosis has been suggested in order to describe a physiological form of thrombosis that supports innate immune defence in microvessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. The use of the term immunothrombosis could be suitable in order to describe thrombotic phenomena with immunological background in large vessels if any correlation is evidenced.\n\n【51】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【52】Epidemiologic data and varied genetic background suggest that BD might not constitute a single disease. Moreover, in a number of patients with large vessel thrombosis, coexistent thrombophilia, acute phase response, lack of malignancy or other known causes of thrombosis, and failure of the antithrombotic therapy alone to treat or at least prevent the expansion of the thrombosis, it seems that another inflammatory disorder is required in order to trigger the thrombogenesis process and therefore the basis for their treatment is immunosuppressant agents. In these cases that share various common features with BD, it is uncertain if the dilemma of the proper treatment, anticoagulant, and/or immunosuppressive treatment can be answered through the heterogeneous spectrum of BD. Distinguishing such patients as suffering from a distinct nosological entity is a hypothesis that can be proved only with further studies. On the contrary, if our hypothesis is incorrect and these patients do represent cases of BD with coincidental coexistent thrombophilia, taking into consideration the proneness of BD to thrombotic events and the highest concomitant epidemiologic prevalences of vasculo-BD and specific inherited procoagulant factors, we propose that all patients with BD who manifest thrombotic events should be assessed for thrombophilia testing, especially those living in Southern Europe, in the Mediterranean basin, and in the Middle East, so that their optimal management can be appropriately weighed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is an aggressive Epstein–Barr virus-associated T cell lymphoma. Clinical syndromes of AITL are not confined to fever and lymphadenopathy, and patients may initially present with polyclonal plasma cell proliferation, which may obscure the underlying disease of AITL, delaying diagnosis. Case Presentation. Here, we report two AITL patients with excessive plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and ascites even mimicking plasma cell leukemia. Both of them had poor endings. Conclusions. Our report emphasizes the complexity of the clinical manifestations of AITL, which aims to increase the alertness of physicians and improve the rate of early diagnosis. Integrated diagnostic approaches such as histopathology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular biology are essential for accurate diagnosis and precise therapy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is an Epstein–Barr virus-associated neoplasm of CD4+ T follicular helper cells (TFH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Patients usually present with B syndrome, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and immune-related syndrome/signs. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and various autoimmune manifestations are distinct features of AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Histologically, the architecture of lymph node is partial or complete effacement with proliferation of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and high endothelial venules (HEVs). Small to medium-sized neoplastic lymphocytes are present in a polymorphous inflammatory background containing histiocytes, eosinophils, reactive lymphocytes, and immunoblasts. The immunoblasts consist of early stage plasma cell (PC), lymphocytes with plasmacytoid features, and large plasmacytoid cells with blast-like nucleusi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that the neoplastic T cells express most pan-T cell antigens (e.g. CD3, CD2, and CD5), and at least 2-3 TFH-associated antigens consist of CD4, ICOS, CXCL13, CD279/PD1, CD10, BCL6, and CCR5 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The absence of surface CD3 and the coexpression of CD4/CD10 represent the typical phenotypic aberrancy of AITL by flow cytometry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. Recurrent mutations in RHOA<sup>G17V</sup> (Ras homology family member A), TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2), DNMT3A (DNA methyl transferase 3 alpha), and IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, mitochondrial) are genetic features of AITL, followed by mutations of some T cell receptor- (TCR-) related genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. IDH2<sup>R172</sup> mutations are relatively specific to AITL with an incidence of 20–30%, especially co-occurring with chromosome (Chr5) gain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. IDH2 mutant cells in AITL may be sensitive to alkylating agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Cytogenetically, gain of Chr5, Chr3, and Chr21 is often observed in AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Reactive polyclonal plasmacytosis occurs in various situations, such as viral infection (EBV, parvovirus B19, and hepatitis), autoimmune diseases, and serum sickness. Excessive plasmacytosis in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) associated with hypergammaglobulinemia in AITL have been reported in the past few years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–21\\]</u>. Early diagnosis can be very challenging. Here, we present two male patients with excessive polyclonal PC proliferation in BM, PB, and ascites. Both of them had poor endings. The purpose of this article is to highlight the complexity of the clinical features of AITL to enable physicians recognize the disease at an early stage. Integrated diagnostic approaches such as histopathology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular biology are essential for accurate diagnosis and precise therapy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Clinical Cases\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 69-year-old man with a medical history of atrial fibrillation was admitted to our hospital due to fever for one month. Laboratory tests showed white blood cells (WBC) 14.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, hemoglobin (Hb) 113 g/L, platelet (PLT) count 85.6 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, and fibrinogen 0.96 g/L. Serum globulin increased to 72.9 g/L. Polyclonal high gamma globulin was observed in serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) (IgG 70.3 g/L, IgA 16.10 g/L, and IgM 3.32 g/L). Chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed generalized lymphadenopathy, significantly enlarged left and right atriums, pulmonary hypertension, and splenomegaly. The 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram monitor showed atrial fibrillation and ST-T changes. Atrial fibrillation was not treated regularly; diltiazem hydrochloride and enoxaparin sodium were suggested by a cardiovascular physician. Concerning the lower fibrinogen and PLT count of the patient, heparin was not given for anticoagulation.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) BM aspirates suggesting plasma cell proliferation (Wright’s stain) (×1000).

Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in BM showed polyclonal PC proliferation with a proportion of ∼45.9% 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(j))</u>. MFC and TCR/IgH receptor gene rearrangement tests were negative in BM and PB.\n\n【10】After BM and lymph node (LN) biopsies were obtained, the patient received symptomatic treatment and fever was controlled. Plasma exchange could temporarily decrease levels of globulin. One week later, he complained of drowsiness and inability to lift his upper limbs, and thereafter, he gradually developed lethargy and progressive decline in blood oxygen saturation. Cervical LN biopsy suggested angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that tumor cells express CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD43, and PD1, and they were negative for CD20, CD10, and BCL6. CD21, CD23, and CD35 showed irregular FDCs proliferation 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(e)–1(i))</u>. Rare small lymphoid cells were positive for EBV (by EBER in situ hybridization). The results of this patient’s examination are shown in Figure 1. The diagnosis of AITL was established, and the patient received low-dose COP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 400 mg, vindesine sulfate 2 mg, and dexamethasone 15 mg). However, severe respiratory distress emerged on the third day of chemotherapy, and the patient eventually died of respiratory and circulatory failure.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【12】A 53-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of fever and cytopenia for 2 months. He went to a local hospital initially. Laboratory tests showed Hb 83 g/L, PLT count 53 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, and serum globulin 68.8 g/L. The T-SPOT test was positive. Ultrasound examination revealed right pleural effusion, abdominal effusion, and generalized lymphadenopathy. No acid-fast bacilli or malignant tumor cells were found in ascites. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of left cervical LN was negative. He received a diagnostic antituberculosis therapy, which suspended in the fifth day due to sudden high fever, and pleural effusion was increased. Thereafter, he went to the tuberculosis specialist hospital, and no acid-fast bacilli were found in the pleural and ascites effusion. Finally, two months later, after clinical symptoms appear, he was referred to our hospital. Laboratory tests showed WBC 6.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, Hb 53 g/L, and PLT count 42 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Serum globulin was more than 100 g/L. SPEP and IFE demonstrated polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (IgA 14.7 g/L, IgG 89.4 g/L, IgM 6.73 g/L, and IgG4 4.96 g/L) and Coomb’s test was positive. Human immunodeﬁciency virus, sera cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B serology, and hepatitis C serology were negative. Plasma EBV DNA was 1.19 × 10<sup>3</sup> copies/ml, and seven days later, it was quantified by qRT-PCR as 3.768 × 10<sup>6</sup> copies/2.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells, EBV-infected B cells. Symptomatic treatment of anti-infection, red blood cell transfusion, and plasma exchange was failed to prevent disease progression.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Bone marrow aspirate suggesting Rouleaux formation and plasma cell proliferation (Wrights stain) (×1000).

The results of this patient’s examination are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. A diagnosis of AITL was established, and the patient received a cycle of R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). Serum globulin was decreased to 84.8 g/L on the fourth day of chemotherapy. However, polyserous effusions and serum globulin levels had not been improved. The blood coagulation disorder is worse than before, and the performance of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) appears. Ultimately, the patient abandoned treatment and discharged.\n\n【15】Table 1 Ancillary examination results of BM, ascites, and LN.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Clinical procedures of AITL are diverse and aggressive. BM, spleen, skin, and liver are the most common extranodal involvement sites. Effusion/edema/ascites occurs in 25–53% of patients and are usually nonneoplastic. BM involvement can be seen in 28–60% patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. MFC seems to be more sensitive to detect involvement than morphology in BM. The neoplastic T cells ranged 0.1–20% of total cells examined by MFC (median, 0.6%) in morphology-negative patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The reason may be that AITL often have a rich background of reactive cells, resulting in a low proportion of tumor cells. However, BM aspirate only counts 200 nucleated cells, which may cause a decrease in sensitivity. It is worth noting that flow cytometry still has diagnostic pitfalls in the diagnosis of T-NHL. On the one hand, due to the polymorphism of the phenotype of T lymphocytes, reactive T lymphocytes may have changes in the expression intensity of pan-T antigens. But the clonality of T cells cannot be identified like B lymphocytes using restricted expression of light chains. The detection of T cell receptor β\\-chain constant region 1 (TRBC 1) may be helpful, and its polyclonal expression can play a role in exclusion, but the monoclonal expression of TRBC1 does not confirm that it must be an abnormal clone. On the other hand, in the following situations, the tissue samples are contaminated by formaldehyde or apoptosis too fast, and the cells lose their viability; there are not enough channels to detect pan-T markers, such as four-color flow cytometry; there are not enough cells for analysis, such as fine-needle aspiration samples, or the proportion of abnormal cells is extremely low; or the abnormal T cells only had changes in expression intensity instead of loss of pan-T antigens expression; or the analysts does not have enough experience; all of these circumstances can lead to negative results. As to AITL, according to our preliminary experiences, apart from the above reasons, abnormal T lymphocytes do not express T cell receptor αβ in nearly ∼57% (51/90) cases. It is impossible to use TRBC1 to judge the monoclonality of suspicious T cells. In addition, AITL has a subtype of sCD3+CD4+CD7-phenotype, the pan-T markers only loss CD7, the expression intensity of CD3 is isointensity, or slightly diminished compared with normal T cells. There are a small amount of sCD3+CD4+CD7-cells in the normal bone marrow, and the proportion of this group of cells may increase under reactive conditions; this kind of AITL is prone to be missed. The addition of more markers of follicular helper T lymphocytes can be helpful to increase positive rate. At last, the bone marrow invasion of AITL is not 100%, so the negative detection in the bone marrow cannot rule out the diagnosis. In patients without BM involvement, trilineage cytopenias and polyclonal plasmacytosis can be observed as secondary features. In our report, patients presented with hypergammaglobulinemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and one patient had polyserous cavity effusions. BM and ascites examinations were performed prior to the diagnosis of AITL. BM aspirate revealed significantly Rouleaux formation with excessive plasmacytosis, mimicking plasma cell leukemia. Paradoxically, PC and immune globulin were both polyclonal. There was no evidence of BM involvement in both of them. Large B cells without surface and cytoplasm light chain expressed were observed in ascites of the second patients by MFC, resembling diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The negative of IgH receptor gene arrangement was nonsupport. With the experience obtained from the first patient, we suggested the probability of AITL of the second one, and rebiopsy was recommended.\n\n【18】LN biopsy is indispensable but not always available. Integrated diagnostic approaches including MFC and molecular genetics examinations are essential for accurate diagnosis. As to the second patient, histopathology suggested AITL by reexamination of LN, and neoplastic T cells detected by MFC and the clonal of TCR gene rearrangement verified the diagnosis. But the immunophenotyping of tumor cells by MFC in LN were CD2+, CD7−, sCD3+, CD4+, and CD10−, not the typical sCD3−/CD4+ or CD10+ immunophenotyping. It probably cannot distinguish AITL from other peripheral T cell lymphoma. But the usage of MFC can quickly exclude reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, T cell rich large B cell lymphoma, and plasma cell diseases, which are difficult to differentiate by pathology. The NGS test detected the recurrent mutations of TET2 and IDH2<sup>R172k</sup>, which further verified the diagnosis, and may be potential therapeutic targets.\n\n【19】AITL have a dismal prognosis with a five-year overall survival (OS) of 32–41% and a seven-year OS of 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. Older age (>60 years old), elevated WBC and IgA levels, thrombocytopenia, high international prognostic index and prognostic index for PTCL-U scores, and number of extranodal involvement sites >1 were adverse factors for OS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 25, 26\\]</u>. Patients with AITL with polyserous effusions seem to have poor endings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 28\\]</u>. Plasma cell hyperplasia seems to have no prognostic significance in AITL patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. We reviewed the clinical history, diagnosis, and treatment process to speculate the possible causes of poor endings. The first patient had a history of atrial fibrillation without regular treatment. Excessively elevated PC may lead to blood stickiness, which may increase the burden on the heart and further induce atrial fibrillation. The treatment to prevent thrombosis formation was unavailable because of lower fibrinogen and PLT count. The manifestations of unable to lift limbs, somnolence, and the sudden decline in blood oxygen saturation lead to the hypothesis of cerebral thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Cerebral infarction may be the direct cause of death. We speculate that the underlying cardiocerebrovascular diseases may make prognosis worse in patients with AITL and excessive plasma proliferation, consistent with Kelsey Sokol’s report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The second patient presented with severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and polyserous cavity effusion at onset, excessive polyclonal PC emerged in BM, PB, and ascites without neoplasm T cells infiltration. The T-SPOT test was positive; he was initially misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. The delayed diagnosis time superadded multiple adverse prognosis indicators that lead to poor conditions of the patient.\n\n【20】The relationship between excessive proliferation of PC and AITL has not been expounded comprehensively. TFH is helpful for differentiation of B cells to PC or memory B cells in lymphoid tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. In the AITL-NGO mouse model, AITL tumor cells were proved to act as TFH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. PC proliferation was accompanied by extensive secretion of IL-6, and the secretion of immune globulin can be completely stopped by adding anti-IL-6 and anti-CD126 (IL-6 receptor) monoclonal antibodies, which manifested that IL-6 is necessary for PC proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. The ultimate differentiation of EBV-infected B cells into PC was related to EBV replication, which is suppressed by a strong T cell immune response in EBV-seropositive healthy people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. EBV-positive B cells can be detected in 66–86% patients of AITL, on account of immunosuppression due to AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Tumor T cells, cytokines, and EBV infection may potentially cause polyclonal plasma cell expansion. In our second patient, EBV copies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was increased to millions, IL-6 levels elevated in sera, and these results were consistent with the past literatures. Whether PC component be a reflection of earlier disease or not should be further explored.\n\n【21】In conclusion, the clinical manifestations of AITL patients are diverse. AITL should be highly suspected in patients presenting with exuberant polyclonal PCs in extranodal sites, combined with syndromes of generalized lymphadenopathy, high EBV copies, and presence of autoimmune antibodies. Integrated diagnostic approaches are essential for accurate diagnosis and precise therapy. Cardiocerebrovascular diseases may be an adverse factor for patients with AITL and significant plasmacytosis, which need to be verified in the future by more samples. The efficacy of traditional treatment in patients with AITL and excessive PC proliferation is less-known and deserves more attention.\n\n【22】#### Abbreviations\n\n| AITL: | Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma |\n| --- | --- |\n| TFH: | T follicular helper |\n| BM: | Bone marrow |\n| PB: | Peripheral blood |\n| MFC: | Multiparameter flow cytometry |\n| EBV: | Epstein–Barr virus |\n| WBC: | White blood cells |\n| Hb: | Hemoglobin |\n| PLT: | Platelet |\n| CT: | Chest computerized tomography |\n| ECG: | Electrocardiogram |\n| FNA: | Fine-needle aspiration |\n| LN: | Lymph node. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by a triad of benign skin tumors (fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, acrochordons) together with an increased risk of developing malignant renal tumors and pulmonary disease such as pneumothoraces and multiple lung cysts. The morbidity and mortality of the affected patients is determined by the presence of the kidney tumors, which tend to be multifocal and bilateral, as observed in other hereditary kidney cancer syndromes like von Hippel-Lindau disease, familial leiomyomatosis, and hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma. Herein, a patient with BHDS, presenting with synchronous bilateral multiple kidney tumors, is reported. The report describes the management of kidney tumors with two-stage open nephron-sparing surgery in which the nonvascular clamping technique was utilized.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited genodermatosis caused as a result of the mutations in the FLCN gene encoding the protein “folliculin,” a new protein which hypothetically functions as a tumor suppressor gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. The affected patients develop cutaneous follicular tumors (multiple fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons) over the face, neck, and upper trunk and are susceptible to develop renal neoplasms and pulmonary disease (spontaneous pneumothoraces, multiple lung cysts).\n\n【4】Kidney tumors in these patients tend to be multifocal and bilateral, as observed in other hereditary cancer syndromes such as von Hippel-Lindau disease, familial leiomyomatosis, and hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Kidney tumors in BHDS are commonly and characteristically reported as “hybrid oncocytic renal cell carcinoma,” which contain areas of oncocytomas as well as areas of renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe, or others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7\\]</u>. Kidney tumors are the major determinants of morbidity and mortality in patients with BHDS; hence the overall renal functions have to be preserved as much as possible while completely removing the tumors within oncological principles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore, this syndrome may represent as an outstanding indication for open-staged nephron-sparing surgery (NSS), in the era of everyday growing laparoscopic/robot-assisted surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【5】We herein report a patient with BHDS, presenting with typical urological, dermatological, and radiological findings .

Case Report\n\n【15】A 56-year-old woman presented with bilateral multiple kidney tumors, diagnosed radiologically during her evaluation for hematuria.\n\n【16】Computed tomography revealed 4 tumors, diameters ranging between 1 and 3 cm in the left kidney, and 4 tumors, diameters ranging between 1 and 5 cm in the right kidney . Radiologically, most of the tumors had malignant characteristics due to their hypervascularity and radiopaque enhancement.\n\n【17】Her chest X-Ray and CT scan of thorax revealed multiple, randomly distributed air-filled small cysts . Intervening lung parenchyma appeared normal. Coronal images, reconstructed with “minimum intensity projection” technique, showed small cysts; most of them clustered in the right upper lobe. No pneumothorax was identified.\n\n【18】On dermatological examination, she had multiple, asymptomatic, white, 1–3 mm sized, dome-shaped, firm papules over the face, neck, scalp, upper trunk, and back, and multiple skin colored, soft, pedunculated papules on the axillae that were clinically consistent with BHDS . Her dermatological history revealed that her facial papules were present since her early twenties and continued to increase in number.\n\n【19】The clinical diagnosis of the patient was consistent with BHDS.\n\n【20】The patient was scheduled first for a staged approach starting from the right side. Preoperative serum analyses were within normal ranges (serum creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL, BUN: 13 mg/dL, Hb: 13.3 gr/dL), and the patient was healthy otherwise.\n\n【21】Nephron-sparing surgeries were performed using standard intercostals (between 11th-12th ribs) flank incision on each side. The technique consisted of adequate exposure of the kidney. Gerota’s fascia was opened; perinephric fatty tissue was dissected off. Ureter and the vascular pedicle were exposed and marked with vessel loops. After documenting all tumors on the kidney, tumors were “enucleoresected” with the kidney under perfusion, first cauterizing the capsule surrounding the tumor and then by removing the tumor with the help of scissors and brain dissector. First the smaller tumors were enucleated, in order to diminish the risk of bleeding. Frozen sections from tumor beds were done for all tumors. Bleeding from the tumor bed was controlled with 3/0 polyglactin (Vicryl) interrupted sutures and parenchyma was adapted with 2/0 polyglactin (Vicryl) sutures over a surgical bolster. Renal vessels were neither clamped nor compressed during these manipulations.\n\n【22】A total of 4 tumors were enucleated from the right kidney. Operation time was 105 minutes. Time spent during tumor enucleations and renographies was 45 minutes. Estimated blood loss was 100 mL. Postoperative course was uneventful, with a postoperative serum creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL and serum Hb of 11.9 gr/dL. The patient was discharged 4 days after left NSS.\n\n【23】The left kidney was treated 6 weeks after the first stage. Using the same, open, no-ischemia NSS technique, a total of 4 tumors were enucleated from the left kidney. Operation time of the left side was 120 minutes. Time spent during tumor enucleations and renographies was 55 minutes. Estimated blood loss was 150 mL. Postoperative course was also uneventful on the right side and the patient was discharged 4 days after surgery.\n\n【24】On macroscopic examination , the excised tumors of the right kidney measured 3.7 cm, 1.8 cm, 1.7 cm, and 1.2 cm in maximal diameter, respectively. The cut sections of each tumor appeared light brown and glistening. No necrosis or hemorrhage was noted. Excised tumors of the left kidney measured 2.7 cm, 2.1 cm, 1.8 cm, and 0.5 cm in maximal diameter, respectively. Cut sections of each tumor were the same with those of right kidney. All of the tumors appeared sharply circumscribed.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Macroscopic view of one of the tumors removed. The cut section appears light brown and glistering.

The H&E sections demonstrated histological features of both oncocytoma and conventional variant of renal cell carcinoma (clear cell RCC). Within these hybrid oncocytic tumors were areas classic for oncocytoma (large cells, ill-defined cell borders, finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm throughout, and large nuclei with homogeneous basophilic chromatin) and other areas consistent with clear cell RCC (well-defined cell borders, clear cytoplasm, round nuclei with centrally located inconspicuous nucleoli). Fuhrman nuclear grade was II in clear cell RCC component. Mitotic features were sparse; no atypical forms were identified.

Discussion\n\n【31】Partial nephrectomy, or “NSS,” has become the standard procedure for management of small renal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. However, there is a debate going on regarding the technique of applying renal ischemia during NSS to avoid renal damage in the treated kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Current literature supports safe ischemia times, within 20 minutes of warm ischemia and up to 2 hours of cold ischemia, to minimize renal ischemic damage. Thus, if ischemia is required, the tumor should be removed within 20 minutes of warm ischemia, regardless of surgical approach, either open or laparoscopic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【32】However, most of the data regarding our current knowledge on this subject is based on large case series, which are composed of “single” small renal masses, and patients with hereditary kidney cancer, such as von Hippel-Lindau disease, familial leiomyomatosis, and hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma usually presenting with bilateral multiple tumors, constitute challenges 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11\\]</u>. Taking into consideration that these patients develop renal tumors at younger ages and that their kidney pathologies are the major determinants of their prognosis, a great care has to be given in their management.\n\n【33】The incidence of multifocality of RCC ranges between 6 and 25% in published series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u> The dilemma of the management of ipsilateral multiple tumors has recently been investigated by Lin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. They compared the operative findings, renal functional outcomes, and intermediate-term cancer-specific survival of patients undergoing either laparoscopic partial nephrectomy or laparoscopic cryoablation and report similar results. However, the number of tumors they treated ranged between 2 and 3 per kidney, and the majority of tumors were <4 cm in size. Furthermore they report a median warm ischemia time of 36 minutes (range: 12–48), although they underline that the postoperative renal function was preserved in all patients in the intermediate term. Interestingly, they managed 2 patients in their series under cold ischemia only without vascular clamping but had to clamp the hilum because of a bleeding during tumor removal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【34】In the present patient, a total of 8 kidney tumors were removed with open NSS from two kidneys and the total surgical manipulation time just for tumor removals and renographies was 45 minutes per kidney, without vascular clamping. This time period is clearly higher than the universally accepted limits under warm ischemia. So even in highly experienced hands, using either open or robot assisted/laparoscopic approach, vascular clamping would increase the risk of renal function loss.\n\n【35】Recently, increasing number of papers are getting published regarding the safety of partial nephrectomy without renal hilar occlusion in selected cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Robot-assisted surgical techniques did clearly supply manipulative advantages, especially during reconstruction, when compared to pure laparoscopic techniques. However, multiple renal tumor removal for multifocal renal cancer, without renal hilar clamping, has not been reported with robot-assisted surgery yet.\n\n【36】In conclusion, we present the case that the nonvascular clamping open NSS, when used in patients with hereditary kidney cancer syndromes such as BHDS, minimizes the risk of renal function loss.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) also known as Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, which results in vascular dysplasia affecting mainly visceral and mucocutaneous organs. Case Presentation. A 65-year-old woman with a 12-year history of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis presented with shortness of breath, easy fatigability, and bilateral lower limb edema. Her family history was significant for definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in first-degree relatives. During the previous 15 days, she has experienced three episodes of recurrent nasal bleeding. She has a background of chronic mitral regurgitation. Physical examination revealed telangiectases in her tongue, lower lip, and hand in addition to signs of congestive heart failure. The patient met 3\\\\4 Curacao criteria and had a definite HHT. Her laboratory workup revealed a hemoglobin count of 5.4 g/dl. Echocardiography revealed a left systolic ejection fraction of 51% with left atrial dilatation and severe mitral regurgitation. Chest X-ray showed features of cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. The abdominal ultrasonography showed enlarged liver size with homogenous texture and congested hepatic veins without features of hepatic AVMs. She was treated with intravenous frusemide, iron supplement, tranexamic acid, blood transfusion, and nasal packing. Conclusions. HTT usually passes unnoticed in Sudan. The rarity of HHT, difficulties in affording diagnostic imaging studies, and low clinical suspicion among doctors are important contributing factors. Anemia resulting from recurrent epistaxis might have an influential role in precipitating acute heart failure in those with chronic rheumatic valvular disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare genetic disorder, which has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The estimated prevalence is 1/5000–1/8000 of population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is characterized by diffuse telangiectases (e.g. ruby-coloured papules that blanch with pressure), recurrent epistaxis, and widespread arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Males and females are equally affected.\n\n【4】The diagnosis is based on the presence of three out of four criteria, called Curaçao criteria, which include recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, small systemic telangiectasia (due to AVMs), visceral involvement, and a strong family history of HHT .\n\n【5】Table 1 The Curacao diagnostic criteria for HHT.\n\n【6】Although the symptoms usually vary according to age, epistaxis is usually the commonest clinical feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【7】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of HHT in Sudan. The rarity of the disease, difficulties in affording the diagnostic imagining and genetic testing, and low clinical suspicion among doctors, all of which pose a challenge in the diagnosis and management of HHT, particularly in resources- limited hospitals.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case presentation\n\n【9】A 65-year-old Sudanese woman came to a university hospital, Sudan, complaining of shortness of breath (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3), easy fatigability, and bilateral lower limb edema. The patient had no history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension. During the previous 15 days, she has experienced three episodes of recurrent nasal bleeding, which were not related to any particular activity, posture, or seasonal variation. There was no bleeding from other orifices. For many years, episodes of nasal bleeding occurred frequently, and the patient received medical advice at their rural hospital. During those episodes, the patient underwent anterior nasal packing, transfused, and then discharged on iron supplements. The patient then came to a university hospital for more advanced evaluation. During the patient workup, the patient experienced an episode of epistaxis for which she underwent anterior nasal packing to control the epistaxis and received tranexamic acid 500 mg tabs TDS, topical tranexamic acid, and packed cells for transfusion. The workup revealed that the patient is a known case of chronic mitral regurgitation, and she was planned for mitral valve replacement, which was not performed due to financial challenges.\n\n【10】The family history was significant for definite HHT in the form of recurrent spontaneous nose bleeding and the same small erythematous lesions (telangiectases) in her grandmother, her son, and her daughter.\n\n【11】Physical examination revealed that the patient looked ill, pale, and not jaundiced. JVP was raised. Her BP was 110/60, pulse rate was 88 BPM, and it was not collapsing. The oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. Mouth examination revealed multiple small erythematous lesions, which blanch on pressure (telangiectases) on her tongue  and one lesion on her lower lip . Hand examination revealed one telangiectasia at the palmar aspect of her right hand . Her cardiovascular examination revealed a pan systolic murmur at the apical area, which radiated to the axilla, and bilateral fine basal crepitations. The liver was tender and palpable 8 cm below the right costal margin without audible bruit, and there is bilateral lower limb edema.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The tongue showing multiple small telangiectasias.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Small telangiectasia at the left border of the lower lip.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Telangiectasias at the palmar aspect of the distal phalanx of the middle finger and the distal phalanx of the little finger.</u>\n\n【15】The laboratory investigations at admission revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia (hemoglobin 5.4 g/dl). Other laboratory investigations are described in Table 2.\n\n【16】Table 2 It describes the results of the blood investigations obtained for the patient.\n\n【17】ECG was noncontributory apart from sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray revealed upper lobe diversion, congested hilar shadows and patchy consolidation in lower lobes (features of pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly) . Echocardiography showed a left systolic ejection fraction of 51% with left atrial dilatation and severe mitral regurgitation. The abdominal ultrasonography (US) displayed enlarged liver size (19 cm) with homogenous texture and congested hepatic veins. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations were not detected on ultrasonography .\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Chest X-ray posterior/anterior view revealed upper lobe diversion and congested hilar shadows and patchy consolidation in lower lobes (features of pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly).</u>\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Abdominal US showing the liver enlarged in size (19 cm) with homogenous texture and congested hepatic veins.</u>\n\n【20】Diagnostic challenges: CT pulmonary angiography was not done due to financial challenges. Contrast echocardiography is an alternative. It was intended to screen the patient for the presence of pulmonary AVMs. Screening can be performed with contrast echocardiography and then a CT-scan in case of a right-to-left shunt. The most feared complication of a pulmonary AVM, cq a right-to-left shunt, is brain abscess, due to paradoxical septical emboli, which are normally trapped in the pulmonary capillaries, but can pass through the pulmonary AVM. As long as the presence of a right-to-left shunt is not excluded in HHT patients, prophylactic antibiotics should be prescribed before any nonsterile procedures, to prevent brain abscess.\n\n【21】Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen was also not done due to financial challenges. It was meant to detect hepatic AVMs and to exclude high-output heart failure. However, clinically, there were no features of hyperdynamic circulation in the patient (e.g. collapsing pulse).\n\n【22】The diagnosis was definite HHT as she fulfilled three items of the Curacao criteria (spontaneous, recurrent nose bleeding, family history in a first-degree relative, and multiple telangiectases at characteristic sites such as tongue, lips, and hands). Anemia, which was attributed to recurrent epistaxis and nutritional factors, is thought to play an influential role in precipitating the heart failure in this patient with chronic rheumatic mitral regurgitation.\n\n【23】The patient was treated with intravenous frusemide, iron supplement, tranexamic acid, blood transfusion, and nasal packing. She was discharged on day 7 on lisinopril tablets and iron supplements in addition to counselling about home-preventive measures of epistaxis.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVM) of the internal organs and mucocutaneous telangiectasias. These AVMs lack the intervening capillaries resulting in direct connections between arteries and veins. They can involve the skin, mucous membranes, brain, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and/or liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The most common clinical features are recurrent spontaneous nosebleeds which present in 50% of patients with HHT at the age of ten, with incidence increasing with age.\n\n【26】HHT was first described in 1864 in a man with a vascular malformation and recurrent epistaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In 1996, Rendu first noticed the correlation between hereditary epistaxis and telangiectasia in a 52-year-old man 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Osler in 1901 and Weber in 1907 then identified the association between hemorrhagic lesions in the skin and mucous membranes and its familial inheritance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. The name ‘hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia’ described by Hanes in 1909 defines the characteristics of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Mutation in genes, including ACVRL1, ENG, and SMAD4 genes, are responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The ENG mutation can lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, while type 2 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is caused by mutations in the ACVRL1 gene. Juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome is caused by a mutation in the SMAD4 gene. It has been proposed that certain mutated HHT genes are associated with specific clinical features, for example, ACVRL1 mutation was found to be associated more with liver AVMs, spinal AVMs, epistaxis, and pulmonary hypertension. ENG mutations were seen to be associated more with pulmonary and brain AVMs, and MADH4 mutations were observed to be associated with juvenile colonic polyposis.\n\n【28】The diagnosis of HHT depends on diagnostic criteria called Curacao criteria . Our patient was diagnosed as definite HHT as she fulfilled three items of the Curacao criteria (spontaneous, recurrent nose bleeding, family history in a first-degree relative, and multiple telangiectasias at characteristic sites such as tongue, lips, and hands).\n\n【29】In patients with HHT, heart failure usually occurs due to hepatic arterial-venous malformation, which causes high-output heart failure. In our patient, anemia, which was attributed to recurrent epistaxis and nutritional factors, is thought to play an influential role in precipitating the heart failure in this patient with chronic rheumatic mitral regurgitation. Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of HHT; chronic blood loss from nasal mucosa or intestinal tract can result in depletion of iron storage, which in turn can lead to microcytic or normocytic anemia.\n\n【30】As per ESC Guidelines HF 2016, in the initial assessment of a patient with newly diagnosed heart failure, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are the recommended diagnostic tests. The treatment is recommended when ferritin is <100 µg/L, or ferritin is between 100 and 299 µg/L and TSAT <20%.\n\n【31】There is no curative treatment for HHT; treatment is symptomatic which focuses on the predominant clinical feature and its severity. The first step in the management of epistaxis is patient counselling about the use of home-preventive measures such as nasal humidification, saline sprays, or ointment to avoid dryness of nasal mucosa and to decrease the risk of nasal trauma in the form of nasal picking and nasal blowing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Other options included nasal packing, photocoagulation, intravascular embolization, and surgery. These methods have a high rate of recurrence with limited efficacy, and they are not available in many resources- limited hospitals. Drugs such as bevacizumab (an antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) are widely used in the treatment of high-output heart cardiac failure in HHT with adequate safety and efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Tamoxifen (antiestrogen medication) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and thalidomide (an antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory agent) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> had been also investigated in the treatment of HHT.\n\n【32】According to ESC, treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the treatment of the underlying cause such as anemia; diuretics are recommended in congested patients with HFpEF to alleviate symptoms and signs.\n\n【33】Patients with HHT have a lower life expectancy than the general population; the prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms. The most common cause of death in HHT is heart failure and sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【34】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【35】In conclusion, cases of HHT may have been passed unnoticed due to rarity of the disease that leads to low clinical suspicion among doctors. Other contributing factors include variation in clinical presentations of the disease, difficulties in affording the diagnostic imaging studies, and the imaging studies might not be available in many resourses-limited hospitals. Anemia resulting from the recurrent epistaxis might have an influential role in precipitating acute heart failure in those with chronic rheumatic valvular disease.\n\n【36】#### Abbreviations\n\n| HHT: | Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia |\n| --- | --- |\n| OWRD: | Osler-Weber-Rendu disease |\n| AVMs: | Arteriovenous malformations |\n| NYHA: | New York Heart Association |\n| BNP: | Brain natriuretic peptide |\n| HFpEF: | Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction |\n| ACVRL1: | Activin A receptor-like type 1 |\n| ENG: | Endoglin |\n| TSAT: | Transferrin saturation. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrated gastric ulcer scars accompanied by marked deformity, without pathologic evidence of malignancy. WE due to peptic ulcer disease in previous reports was substantially associated with thiamine deficiency due to recurrent vomiting or surgical procedures. In our case, however, there was no history of vomiting or gastrointestinal surgery. Besides, we thoroughly ruled out other known clinical settings related to WE. There is the possibility that peptic ulcer disease itself provoked thiamine deficiency due to malabsorption.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by nystagmus and ophthalmoplegia, ataxia of gait, and mental confusion. It results from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency and is observed mainly in alcoholics. Here, we describe a case of non-alcoholic WE in peptic ulcer disease. WE due to peptic ulcer disease in previous reports was substantially associated with thiamine deficiency due to recurrent vomiting or surgical procedures; the mechanisms of thiamine deficiency after surgical procedures include the occurrence of recurrent vomiting, poor compliance with an adequate dietary intake, and the reduced area of the gastrointestinal mucosa for absorbing thiamine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In our case, however, there was no history of vomiting or gastrointestinal surgery. We consider that peptic ulcer disease itself provoked thiamine deficiency due to malabsorption.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with subacute progression of diplopia, gait disturbance, and mental status change. He began to notice slight diplopia three months before admission, but he could work as a carpenter until several weeks before admission. According to his family members, he ate a balanced diet regularly and had not consumed alcohol in recent years. His past medical history was hemorrhagic gastric ulcer managed without surgery two years earlier, and then intake of lansoprazole was started. There was no history of vomiting lately. His family history was unremarkable. On admission, he exhibited mental sluggishness, disorientation, and anterograde amnesia. Neurological examination showed ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and ataxia. Blood tests demonstrated a low thiamine concentration (12.7 ng/mL; normal range 21.3–81.9 ng/mL). Results of other blood tests, including vitamins B2, B6, B12, folic acid, nicotinic acid, complete blood count, kidney and thyroid function, magnesium concentration, CEA, CA19-9, and IgG anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody, were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed symmetrical high-intensity lesions in the medial thalami, hypothalami, periaqueductal grey matter, and the floor of the fourth ventricle on T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images . Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was unremarkable. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrated gastric ulcer scars accompanied by marked deformity . The duodenum and other parts of the gut were normal.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | MRI-FLAIR images of the brain showed symmetrical high-intensity lesions  in the floor of the fourth ventricle (a), periaqueductal grey matter (b), hypothalami (b), and medial thalami (c). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Marked deformity and shortening of the gastric angle (arrowhead) and lesser curvature (arrow), and insufficient distention of the pyloric antrum on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (a) and gastric fluoroscopy (b). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】Intravenous thiamine (up to 1500 mg per day) was immediately administered for suspected WE on admission, and his consciousness, ocular manifestation and gait disturbance were markedly improved. However, disorientation and anterograde amnesia remained, and over the next several weeks he developed confabulation suggesting Korsakoff’s syndrome. Multiple and repetitive biopsies of the gastric mucosa over the next two years showed chronic gastritis without evidence of malignancy.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】The present patient was diagnosed as having WE based on the low serum thiamine concentration, response of neurological signs to parenteral thiamine administration, and typical brain MRI findings. Clinical settings related to WE described in previous reports were thoroughly ruled out: chronic alcohol abuse and malnutrition; history of gastrointestinal surgical procedures; unbalanced nutrition including staple diet of polished rice; recurrent vomiting or chronic diarrhea; cancer; systemic diseases such as renal disease, hyperthyroidism, and chronic infectious febrile diseases; magnesium depletion; the use of drugs causing WE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In general, thiamine is known to be absorbed in the duodenum. However, SLC19A2, one of the high-affinity thiamine transporters, was reported to show greater expression in the stomach more than in the duodenum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This finding suggests that the stomach plays a more important role in thiamine absorption than previously thought. Thus, we consider that thiamine deficiency in this patient was due to thiamine malabsorption in the stomach involved with severe gastric mucosal lesions.\n\n【12】Patients with peptic ulcer disease often receive a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs have been recognized to induce hypomagnesemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, which can provoke WE by suboptimum thiamine phosphorylation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although the use of PPIs should receive attention as a cause of WE, we do not consider in this respect that the PPI therapy was related to WE in our patient because the serum magnesium level was normal. Meanwhile, the mechanism of thiamine absorption in gastrointestinal lumen involves hydrogen cations, and the regular use of antacids may interfere with the absorption of thiamine though there has been no direct evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Accordingly, we cannot completely deny the possibility that the long-term PPI use induced thiamine deficiency in this patient.\n\n【13】Since not every individual with a similar degree of thiamine deficiency develops WE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, genetic factors may also be likely to contribute disease expression in our patient. Some studies have shown that variations in genes coding for transketolase and the high-affinity thiamine transporters are implicated in the pathophysiology of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–11\\]</u>. In WKS, several genetic defects might combine with environmental factors to produce clinical manifestations when thiamine storage declines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【14】WE due to peptic ulcer disease in previous reports was substantially associated with thiamine deficiency due to recurrent vomiting or surgical procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. This case is different in that respect, and there is the possibility that peptic ulcer disease itself provoked thiamine deficiency due to malabsorption. Indeed, it is unclear why only this case developed WE despite the large number of patients with peptic ulcer disease. However, clinicians should keep in mind that WE can occur as a rare complication of peptic ulcer disease because WE is a serious and preventable disease. We wish to emphasize that occasional measurement of blood thiamine levels is desirable in patients with severe gastric mucosal lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Patients usually lack atherogenic risk factors and most commonly present with intermittent claudication in the early stages. In the later stages of undiagnosed PAES, acute ischaemia can occur as a result of complete arterial occlusion or embolism. Hence, early diagnosis and surgical release of the entrapment is crucial for good operative outcome and to prevent limb loss.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The anatomical basis of popliteal entrapment was first described by Stuart in 1879 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and the term “popliteal artery entrapment syndrome” was introduced by Love and Whelan in 1965 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

PAES is mostly found in young sportsmen or soldiers with well-developed muscles and has even been described in military personnel who operate armored vehicles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Typical patients are young and, therefore, lack the risk factors that would predispose them to atherosclerosis. The lack of such risk factors is the main reason for diagnostic delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The following case report outlines an unusual presentation of unilateral popliteal artery entrapment syndrome and delves into the importance of early diagnosis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 24-year-old fit-and-healthy ex-army officer presented with a two-day history of a cold, numb, and painful left lower leg; he had been doing vigorous exercises two days prior to admission. Over the past few months, the patient had experienced similar worsening leg pain after running long distances. Apart from smoking (5 pack years), the patient had no other significant cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed a regular heart rate of 60 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg. There was no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm. Examination of the right leg was unremarkable. On the left side, there were normal palpable femoral and popliteal pulses, but no palpable distal pulses. The left foot also appeared paler; however, motor and sensory functions were intact.\n\n【7】An angiogram revealed a thrombotic occlusion of the proximal half of the popliteal artery and a small embolus in the mid-peroneal artery . Intraarterial thrombolysis (Alteplase) was commenced. A 24-hour followup angiogram showed a reduction in the size of the thrombus; however, there was still a stricture at the midpopliteal artery with an irregularity of the wall. The stricture was accentuated with the foot in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. At 48 hours, the angiogram demonstrated that the thrombus had largely resolved; however, the stricture was still present. The site of stenosis was angioplastied which resulted in a marked improvement in blood flow.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Angiogram of the left leg before thrombolysis, showing complete occlusion of the popliteal artery. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】An MRI scan was subsequently performed and showed the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle going between the popliteal artery and vein where it inserted in a more lateral position . Having excluded bilateral disease on the MRI, the patient underwent surgery-division of the medial head of gastrocnemius with autogenous saphenous vein interposition graft. A postoperative duplex scan showed that the vein graft was patent with pulsatile signals.

Discussion\n\n【12】Various classifications of PAES exist in the literature. The most commonly used one was proposed by Whelan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and divides this condition into five types .

Physical signs are usually absent at rest, until complications develop. In young persons, symptoms are limited to intermittent claudication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and this is due to the intermittent compression of the artery during plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. Chronic extrinsic arterial compression leads to vascular microtrauma, early arteriosclerosis, and subsequent thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Thrombus formation, in the later stages of PAES, may cause complete obstruction of the popliteal artery leading to acute limb-threatening ischaemia; this is commonly seen in patients who have not developed sufficient collateral circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Hence, this condition needs to be included in the list of diagnoses in young patients who present with symptoms of peripheral vascular disease.\n\n【16】Angiography is the classical screening and diagnostic tool in PAES 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It can demonstrate compression of the popliteal artery with the ankle plantar flexed. Gourgiotis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> pointed out that an irregularity of the wall of the popliteal artery (in an otherwise normal arterial tree) should also raise suspicion of PAES. Transverse T1-weighted MR imaging is useful to evaluate the aberrant muscular anatomy of the popliteal fossa and also to demonstrate the deviation of the popliteal artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The most common and successful treatment option is muscle division to release the entrapment. If there is significant delay in diagnosis, the popliteal artery may become occluded, stenotic, or aneurysmal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In such complicated cases, division of the anomalous musculotendinous structure and vascular reconstruction is generally required.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】PAES is a rare but potentially limb-threatening condition affecting predominantly young male adults. This syndrome is difficult to diagnose and, therefore, poses a diagnostic pitfall. Awareness of this entity is a prerequisite for correct and prompt diagnosis. Careful history and physical examination is of utmost importance. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute popliteal artery occlusion or claudication in young patients with no cardiovascular risk factors. Early surgical intervention to release the popliteal artery is the treatment of choice and is important for good operative outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This is partly due to the lack of established criteria for the diagnosis of this resistance. However, some clinical aspects may suggest that the diagnosis does not necessarily have to be positive insulin receptor antibodies as such patients could respond to immunosuppressive treatment. Methods. We describe a case and have performed a literature review on PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar bibliographic databases to identify all case reports. All available studies from January 1975 through December 2020 were included. Data collected were tabulated, and outcomes were analyzed cumulatively. Results. Thirty-one cases of TBIRS associated with SLE have been described. These patients presented with catabolic symptoms and hyperglycemia in most cases, with an average time from the onset of symptoms of four months. In addition to that clinical characteristics related to SLE were variable, along with certain common characteristics such as acanthosis in 60% of patients. Almost all the patients had antibodies against insulin receptors. The insulin doses required by the patients ranged from 450 to 25,000 U daily. Remission was achieved in 80% of the patients with a two-year follow-up. Most patients associated with late-onset SLE, like our patient, achieved metabolic control after immunosuppressive treatment. Conclusion. High insulin resistance in patients with de novo diabetes mellitus (DM) without obesity should be considered as a possible clinical manifestation of an autoimmune disease such as SLE, with a good metabolic response to the immunosuppressive management established.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

The patient was referred to a fourth-level hospital based on a malignant neoplasm suspicion: weight loss of 20–30 kg in the last two to three months (her weight at the time of evaluation was 100 kg) and absence of metabolic control. The patient mentioned occasional Raynaud’s phenomenon. Periocular and perioral acanthosis nigricans , and a left supraclavicular mobile lymphadenopathy of 1 cm diameter, with no inflammatory changes, were observed in physical examination. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. During in-patient stance, glucometer registry was between 350–400 mg/dL, despite receiving glargine insulin 138 U/day and glulisine insulin 44 U three times a day.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Periocular, perioral, cervical, and mandibular acanthosis.</u>\n\n【11】In Table 1, the main laboratory findings are registered, including lymphopenia and positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) that associated with Raynaud’s phenomenon, suggested a late-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosis. However, as a malignant neoplasm was suspected, a cervical lymph node biopsy and a bone marrow biopsy were performed, which were unremarkable. The rest of the endocrine and imaging tests were normal.\n\n【12】Table 1 Laboratory results during patient’s hospital stay.\n\n【13】Due to the high insulin requirements, an insulin drip was started and titrated, with the highest dose up to 43 U/kg/day with capillary blood glucometer around 200 mg/dL. An insulin resistance syndrome mediated by autoimmunity was suspected based on the clinical presentation–in this case, late-onset SLE. Therefore, management with methylprednisolone 250 mg/day for three days and a prednisolone taper starting at 50 mg/day was initiated. Insulin dose was successfully reduced to less than 2 U/kg/day and a bridge with subcutaneous insulin was performed until insulin drip was suspended . Nonetheless, the patient presented catheter-associated bacteremia, which delayed rituximab initiation. Rituximab therapy was finally started, achieving excellent clinical and metabolic results because at discharge, she only required linagliptin for glycemic control without the need for insulin or another hypoglycemic agent. The patient remained on maintenance immunosuppression with prednisolone 5 mg and chloroquine 250 mg daily. Unfortunately, after discharge, she did not return to our institution for reasons related to her health insurance.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Blood glucose plot. Improvement after IV methylprednisolone pulse and oral prednisolone therapy.</u>\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Type B insulin resistance syndrome (TBIRS) is an extremely rare entity, with unknown prevalence. Only 116 cases have been described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. The first time this disease was described was in 1975 when six patients presented with overt insulin resistance with acanthosis nigricans and high insulin requirements due to a serum-circulating factor which affected insulin binding to its receptor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. These patients required up to 100 times more insulin. Extreme requirements from 700 up to 177,500 insulin units per day were registered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Some authors like Willard et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, suggest that the biochemical triad of extremely high levels of fasting insulin, hyperadiponectinemia, and hypotriglyceridemia in patients with acanthosis nigricans and underlying autoimmune disease may be considered as a clinical definition of TBIRS. In addition, other characteristics may lead to TBIRS suspicions, such as slim patients with insulin requirements higher than 3 U/kg/day and persistent hyperglycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Three mechanisms have been described for hyperglycemia in this disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>: autoantibodies competing for the insulin receptor binding site, the binding of such autoantibodies leading to receptor degradation, and the agonist/antagonist action of these autoantibodies with a biphasic response (hypo and hyperglycemia).\n\n【19】The biggest TBIRS cohort was obtained in the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In this cohort, 24 patients were followed for 28 years, finding that TBIRS is more frequent in African American women, with an underlying autoimmune disease, and an age between 20 and 68 years, although teenager cases have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In these patients, only three of them developed hypoglycemia, and SLE was observed in up to 46% of patients. Most had a BMI less than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and in those with a BMI lower than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, one third presented with hypoglycemia and two thirds with hyperglycemia, reflecting an insulin resistance profile different to those with obesity. Perioral and periocular acanthosis nigricans were observed in up to 88% of patients; other patients presented with a deeper voice and lower extremity wasting due to overweight. In the autoimmune laboratory, ANA was observed in 83% of patients and hypocomplementemia (C3 predominantly) in 21%. 25% had spontaneous remission and patients treated with glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis, cyclosporine, and azathioprine had a variable response time from five months up to 54 months.\n\n【20】In a recent systematic review 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, 115 TBIRS cases were reported. Most were women (76.5%) with a mean age of 42 years. 50% had normal weight and acanthosis nigricans, 45% had hyperglycemia, 42.9% had hypoglycemia at any time of the disease course, and diabetic ketoacidosis was observed in only 11.8%. SLE was the main etiology in 33%, as the NIH cohort. In some patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma, TBIRS was the initial manifestation as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. In relation to laboratory findings, mean HbA1c was 10.8% (5.1–18.7), fasting serum insulin of 1309 μg/dl (0.1–10.584), C peptide of 13.9 ng/mL (0.1–63.0), and triglycerides of 72.8 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(36–155)</u>; autoimmunity laboratory was remarkable for ANA, present in 60%, hypocomplementemia in 20%, and anti-insulin antibodies were ordered in only 36.1% with half being positive.\n\n【21】Out of 115 patients, 83 (70%) achieved disease remission and 20.5% with spontaneous remission. In the first phase, prednisolone was used in 40% of patients (dose of 50–60 mg), cyclophosphamide in 20%, rituximab in 10%, and plasmapheresis in 8–10%. During this phase, remission was achieved in 40% of patients. The mean daily insulin dose was 1747 U/day (54–57.600), which led to admission for intravenous drip titration. Time-to-remission had a mean of four months (0.25–54). No statistically significant relationship could be established between negative anti-insulin antibodies and disease remission. The mortality in this systematic review was 15.38%; one out of four patients died due to intractable hypoglycemia.\n\n【22】Thirty-one SLE-associated TBIRS cases have been described , these patients had hypoglycemia (35%) or catabolic symptoms and hyperglycemia (66%) as the initial symptoms. The time of symptom onset was from one up to 15 months. The most common ANA pattern was speckled (32%). No single SLE sign or symptom was predominant, as the clinical presentation was variable among all patients. Acanthosis nigricans was present in 60% of patients. Predominant antibodies were anti-insulin receptors (97%). 37.5% TBIRS were associated with late-onset SLE. Insulin doses required were between 450–25,000 U/day. Remission was achieved in 80% of patients with a follow-up of two years. 10% of patients did not respond to the therapy, with persistent hypoglycemia. Most late-onset SLE-associated TBIRS required additional immunosuppressant therapy to achieve remission and metabolic control (other than steroids). Nonetheless, in our patient glycemic control was achieved after glucocorticoid therapy. An interesting finding in our patient was that in addition to anti-insulin antibodies, normal C peptide, and fasting insulin, clinical signs of insulin resistance and high insulin requirements, hypotriglyceridemia was observed, which is suggested as another variable to consider for the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Table 2 SLE-associated TBIRS patients’ description.\n\n【24】Table 3 SLE-associated TBIRS patients’ characteristics.\n\n【25】The treatment includes two main goals: glycemic control, and immunosuppression when it is required. No single protocol is established, and no clinical trial has been performed in this population. The treatment has certain details which must be considered, such as mean insulin requirement which was up to 5600 U/day in the NIH cohort; some patients required up to 30,000 U/day. Concentrated insulin products may improve insulin administration when higher doses are required. U-500 insulin is five times more concentrated than U-100 insulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>; therefore, it is considered the cornerstone of therapy in patients with insulin resistance; unfortunately, it is not available in Colombia. In a nine-study meta-analysis, patients with different types of U-100 and U-500 insulin were included: patients treated with U-500 insulin had a higher weight gain of 4.4 kg, but no difference was observed in hypoglycemias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. To administer such high insulin doses safely, the patient must be admitted and an intravenous insulin drip must be started. Treatment schemes have been established by academic medical centers and the main therapeutic goal is normal fasting glucose to achieve metabolic control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35, 36\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Immunosuppression is directed to resolve the underlying autoimmune process. Multiple treatment schemes have been used as was observed in the systematic review by Martins et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. NIH proposed a standardized treatment regime with a combination of rituximab, monthly pulse steroid therapy (dexamethasone 40 mg/day for four days), and cyclophosphamide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. This scheme was used in a 45-year-old patient with 20 kg unexplained weight loss, disseminated acanthosis nigricans, blood glucose higher than 500 mg/dL, anti-insulin receptor antibodies, and lack of metabolic control despite 600 daily insulin units and no improvement with prednisolone, azathioprine, or plasmapheresis. The patient finally improved after rituximab 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> divided into two doses two weeks apart, associated with oral cyclophosphamide 100 mg/day and dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days. Fasting glucose improved down to 80–100 mg/dL, HbA1c was reduced from 11.8% to 6.5%, and perioral, periocular, and periauricular acanthosis nigricans improved as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.\n\n【27】#### 5\\.

We herein describe an 81-year-old woman who developed acute-onset excruciating thigh pain and weakness in her lower extremities after spinal surgery. We diagnosed acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy by a nerve conduction study, which showed findings of demyelination without cerebrospinal fluid analysis because of a spinal prosthesis. Although anti-GM1 and anti-GalNAc-GD1a antibodies were positive, the patient was clinically diagnosed with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (a subtype of GBS), not acute motor axonal neuropathy. She recovered well with immunoglobulin therapy. A literature review of 18 cases revealed that unexplained weakness, areflexia, and numbness of the extremities after spinal surgery, a shorter time from spinal surgery to symptom onset to general GBS, abnormal nerve conduction study results, normal spinal imaging findings, and the development of atypical symptoms such as cranial and autonomic nerve syndrome and respiratory failure are useful for diagnosing GBS when cerebrospinal fluid examination cannot be performed after spinal surgery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmune inflammatory polyneuropathy that affects the peripheral nervous system and is usually triggered by infectious disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The incidence of GBS in the general population of the United States is reportedly 1-2 per 100,000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The postsurgical incidence of GBS is 4.1 per 100,000 patients, and the incidence after spinal surgery is 1 per 2,000 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The onset of complications after spinal surgery ranges from 4% to 19% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, and the overall incidence of neurologic complications is <1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The mortality rate of GBS within 1 year after diagnosis is reportedly 4.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, and the rate of requiring mechanical ventilation is 38% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The early symptoms of GBS mimic an acute spinal cord compression disorder or nerve root compression syndrome, and GBS can thus be difficult to differentiate from complications after spinal surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is essential for diagnosing GBS; however, postoperative spinal changes often make CSF collection and analysis difficult.\n\n【5】Although GBS is a rare complication after spinal surgery, its correct diagnosis is crucial because it will prevent a reoperation based on a misdiagnosis of recurrent spinal problems. We herein describe a case of GBS that mimicked spinal cord injury after spinal surgery. Although the characteristics of GBS after spinal surgery have been previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, the strategies for differentiating postoperative complications and GBS have not been well summarized. We reviewed previous reports to clarify these diagnostic challenges.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】An 81-year-old Japanese woman with a history of cervical canal stenosis and bilateral knee osteoarthritis visited our outpatient orthopedics department with the chief complaint of claudication and pain in the back of the thigh. These symptoms had been present for 1 year and had worsened 3 months before her visit. She had developed no recent infections nor received any vaccinations in the previous few months, and she had no surgical history. Muscle strength testing according to the Medical Research Council scale demonstrated grade 5/5 muscle strength in the bilateral upper and lower extremities, but her bilateral extensor digitorum longus and brevis strength was 4/5. Her bilateral patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes were brisk. On sensory examination, she showed hyperesthesia in the bilateral distal part of lower legs on light touch testing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed severe lumbar spinal stenosis at L1–5 and spondylolisthesis at L4/5 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. She was diagnosed with spondylolisthesis with lumbar spinal stenosis. An L1–5 laminectomy and L4/5 posterolateral fusion were performed under general anesthesia without surgical complications. Her claudication improved, and she was able to ambulate with a walker. She developed no acute complications for 8 days after the surgery.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Imaging findings. (a) Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating severe lumbar spine stenosis at L1–5 and spondylolisthesis at L4/5. (b), (c) No percutaneous pedicle screw deviation or compression observed in the spinal canal. (d) Cervical MRI revealing spinal canal stenosis extending to C4–6 and disc herniation at the C3/4 level. (e) Lumbar MRI showing bilateral foraminal narrowing at the L4/5 level after laminectomy for L4 anterior spondylolysis, but no apparent implant deviation.</u>\n\n【9】Nine days after the surgery, she developed only one episode of transient soft stool without fever, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Eleven days after the surgery, she reported acute onset of excruciating bilateral thigh pain. She subsequently developed difficulty walking because of ascending weakness of her bilateral lower extremities. The tingling in her bilateral lower extremities was exacerbated. On physical examination, she was conscious and afebrile, and her surgical wound was healing well. All cranial nerves were intact, and she had no difficulty swallowing or breathing. Muscle strength testing showed grade 4/5 in the upper distal extremities and 3/5 in the lower distal and proximal extremities, with no muscle atrophy. On sensory examination, the hyperesthesia in the bilateral distal parts of her lower legs was exacerbated on light touch testing. The bilateral tendon reflexes of the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and brachioradialis were normal, but the bilateral patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes were absent. Pathological reflexes, including those in the upper and lower extremities, were negative. She was unable to stand or walk. Routine blood tests, including a complete blood count, glucose, electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes, were within normal limits. Serum anti-GM1-IgG and anti-GalNAc-GD1a-IgG antibodies were positive, with optical density values (control <0.1) of 0.157 and 0.135, respectively.\n\n【10】Spinal computed tomography showed no evidence of spinal cord compression 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(b) and 1(c))</u>. Brain MRI showed no abnormalities. MRI of the whole spine showed moderate disc herniation at the C3/4 level without significant cord or nerve root compression or an epidural hematoma or abscess 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(d) and 1(e))</u>. An acute polyradiculoneuropathy was suspected based on rapidly progressive ascending weakness, sensory disturbance, and areflexia of the lower extremities without implant-related complications. We therefore consulted a neurologist, and a nerve conduction study (NCS) was performed 21 days after surgery. Table 1 and Figure 2 show the results of the NCS. The median and tibial motor nerves showed findings of demyelination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, such as prolonged terminal latencies, reduction in the compound muscle action potential, a slowed conduction velocity, and temporal dispersion. The ulnar motor nerve showed a decrease in amplitude. The F wave was absent in the bilateral median, ulnar, and tibial motor nerves. The sensory examination showed an abnormal median and normal sural sensory response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Because we did not perform needle electromyography, therefore, we could not evaluate fibrillation potentials. In addition, we did not identify visible fasciculation in any involved muscles or any new central nerve disorders using neuroimaging studies. A CSF examination was difficult to perform because the patient had recently undergone lumbar spinal surgery. Given the acute onset of her symptoms, normal spinal imaging findings, and significant evidence of demyelination on the NCS, she was diagnosed with GBS.\n\n【11】Table 1 Electrophysiological findings 21 and 38 days after spinal surgery.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Nerve conduction study results. At 21 days after surgery, the median and tibial motor nerves showed findings of demyelination, such as prolonged terminal latencies, reduction in the compound muscle action potential, a slowed conduction velocity, and temporal dispersion. The ulnar motor nerve showed a decrease in amplitude. The sensory examination showed an abnormal median and normal sural sensory response. The F wave was absent in the bilateral median, ulnar, and tibial motor nerves (data not shown). At 38 days after surgery, the median and ulnar motor nerve compound muscle action potentials had residual prolonged terminal latencies but improved amplitudes. The tibial nerve showed temporal dispersion on both day 21 and day 28 with no improvement. The median and ulnar sensory nerves abnormalities were exacerbated, but the sural nerve remained normal.</u>\n\n【13】Treatment was started 9 days after the appearance of symptoms. Immunoglobulin therapy was started at a dose of 0.4 g/kg for 5 days. After 1 month of follow-up, her upper and lower extremity weakness resolved, and motor examination showed grade 5/5 in the upper extremities and 4/5 in the lower extremities. She had residual tingling in both lower extremities. An NCS performed 38 days after surgery showed that the median and ulnar motor nerve compound muscle action potentials had residual prolonged terminal latencies but improved amplitudes. There was no improvement in the tibial nerve with temporal dispersion on day 21 and day 38. The median and ulnar sensory nerve abnormalities were exacerbated, but the sural nerve remained normal . She needed a cane to walk, but muscle strength testing according to the Medical Research Council scale showed that her extremity muscle strength had improved to grade 5/5. She was able to ambulate with a cane and was subsequently transferred to a rehabilitation hospital.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Literature Review\n\n【15】To understand the clinical characteristics of our case, we reviewed case reports of GBS after spinal surgery. A search of the PubMed database was performed using the terms “Guillain–Barré syndrome” AND “spinal surgery OR spine surgery” for all articles published until May 2021. We identified 14 published reports involving 18 patients with GBS after spinal surgery  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–24\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Table 2 Characteristics of previous patients diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome after spinal surgery.\n\n【17】Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of previously described patients diagnosed with GBS after spinal surgery. Their average age was 56.8 years (range, 33–73 years), and the male/female ratio was 11/7 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–24\\]</u>. The vertebral regions affected by the surgery were the lumbar region in eight (44.4%) patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17, 20–24\\]</u>, the cervical region in four (22.2%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15,18\\]</u>, the thoracolumbar region in three (16.7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 14, 18\\]</u>, the thoracic region in one (5.6%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, the thoracosacral region in one (5.6%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, and the lumbosacral region in one (5.6%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The average duration of time from spinal surgery to the onset of GBS symptoms was 7.4 days (range, 1 hour to 22 days), with two patients having a duration of ≤3 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>, and the duration of time from onset of GBS symptoms to diagnosis was 7.2 days (range, 1–19 days). Ten (55.6%) patients had motor weakness at the nadir in the lower limbs only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 15, 17–20, 22–24\\]</u>, and eight (44.4%) had motor weakness in the upper and lower limbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14, 16–18, 21\\]</u>. Seven (38.9%) patients had sensory deficits at the nadir in the lower limbs only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 16, 17, 20, 22–24\\]</u>, five (27.8%) in the upper and lower limbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13, 15, 17, 19\\]</u>, and one (11.1%) in the upper limbs only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Eleven (61.1%) patients showed areflexia or hyporeflexia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–17, 20–23\\]</u>. Three (16.7%) patients reported pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 22, 24\\]</u>. Nine (50.0%) patients had cranial nerve symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24\\]</u>, which included facial paralysis, dysphagia, decreased gag reflex, and impaired vocalization. Five (27.8%) patients had autonomic nerve symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15, 19, 23\\]</u>, which included fever, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, urinary retention, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation. Nine (50.0%) patients needed mechanical ventilator support by intubation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 13, 14, 17–20\\]</u>, one patient could not be weaned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>, and the rest received temporary support. Seven (38.9%) patients needed a reoperation to determine the cause of postoperative complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15, 17, 18\\]</u>. CSF examinations were performed in 10 (55.6%) patients, 6 of 12 (50.0%) patients who underwent lumbar surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 16, 17, 21, 23\\]</u>, and 4 of 5 (80.0%) patients who underwent nonlumbar surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 15, 18\\]</u>). Fifteen (88.2%) patients underwent an NCS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–20,22–24\\]</u>. Antiganglioside antibodies were detected in two patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 17\\]</u>, but the prior infection status was unknown. Seventeen patients underwent intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–24\\]</u>, three patients received concomitant plasma exchange (PE) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 17\\]</u>, and two patients received concomitant high-dose corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 23\\]</u>. One patient received high-dose corticosteroids only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. No deaths occurred. The motor impairment was improved in many patients; however, some had residual sensory disturbances.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Clinicians should be aware of progressive muscle weakness, areflexia, or numbness after a spinal operation as potential signs of GBS. The clinical features that are helpful for the diagnose of GBS after spinal surgery can be summarized from previous literature as follows: shorter time from spinal surgery to symptom onset to general GBS, abnormal NCS results, normal spinal imaging, and the development of atypical symptoms such as cranial and autonomic nerve syndrome and respiratory failure. We consider that even when CSF testing is not available, an NCS is preferable to CSF analysis in the diagnosis of GBS and is clinically useful. Furthermore, rapid initiation of treatment with IVIg and/or PE is useful for improving the prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. GBS after spinal surgery presents a unique diagnostic challenge, and we devised a flowchart  based on previous literature.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Strategies for diagnosis and treatment of Guillain–Barré syndrome after spinal surgery.</u>\n\n【21】The mechanism of GBS development most likely involves a recent preceding upper or lower respiratory tract infection or gastrointestinal illness followed by an immunological response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The mechanism by which GBS develops after surgery is considered to involve an interaction between the anesthetic agents and peripheral nerve myelin or local trauma to roots; this may initiate a cascade of immunologic events that result in demyelinating neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Staff et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> reported an inflammatory change in nerve biopsy samples from patients with nontraumatic postoperative neuropathy within 30 days after surgery. Surgery alters the balance of the immune system and causes transient immunosuppression, which can trigger the onset of GBS and promote subclinical infection that can also predispose a patient to GBS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28, 29\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Serum anti-GM1 and anti-GalNAc-GD1a antibodies, which were detected in our case, are reportedly associated with acute motor axonal neuropathy in electrophysiological studies due to preinfection by Campylobacter jejuni 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30, 31\\]</u>. Ogawa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u> reported that the presence of anti-GM1/GalNAc-GD1a antibodies was correlated with pure motor GBS characterized by antecedent respiratory infection, fewer cranial nerve deficits, and conduction blocks at intermediate sites of motor nerves. We did not perform serological testing for C. jejuni because our patient had only one episode of soft stool, had not ingested any components that could cause infectious enteritis, and was not considered to have Campylobacter enteritis. Therefore, the relationship between the antiganglioside antibodies and the patient’s symptoms was unclear.\n\n【23】Most reported cases of postoperative GBS occurred within 1–3 weeks, with a maximum of 6 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our literature review indicated that the onset of GBS symptoms after spinal surgery tended to be earlier than that after nonspinal surgery, although it was later than the occurrence of other complications such as iatrogenic spinal cord injury or postoperative herniation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. However, Wakerley and Yuki 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u> reported that the onset of GBS within 2 days after surgery would be triggered not by the surgery but by preoperative triggers and subsequent immune mechanisms (e.g. infection, vaccines, and trauma). Xu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> reported that a patient developed GBS 2 days after surgery and had received an influenza vaccine 10 days before surgery. The duration of postoperative symptom onset and a careful preoperative history can help to reveal the cause.\n\n【24】An NCS is the most useful examination for GBS after spinal surgery because an NCS is less likely to be affected by the postoperative state than is a CSF analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. An NCS in patients with GBS typically shows a multifocal demyelinating process, including conduction block or temporal dispersion in motor nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Abnormal median and normal sural sensory responses are highly suggestive of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) subtypes of GBS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Our patient exhibited these findings, which were useful for diagnosing the underlying cause of her muscle weakness. Uncini and Kuwabara proposed the characteristics of “nodopathy” as rapidly reversible nerve conduction block due to paranodal myelin detachment and nodal sodium channel disruption, the absence of excessive temporal dispersion associated with remyelination, and eventual complement-mediated axonal degeneration depending on the severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. In the present case, the findings of temporal dispersion of the tibial nerve at day 38 (after the symptoms had improved) and no evidence of conduction block support the diagnosis of AIDP rather than nodopathy. Anti-GM1 antibodies have been reported to be associated with acute motor axonal neuropathy, but our literature review revealed an association between acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> and AIDP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Our literature review also showed that AMSAN has recently been associated with spinal surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 15, 22\\]</u>. AMSAN is rare and usually presents with severe symptoms over a short period, and patients often experience prolonged and incomplete recovery compared with other forms of GBS. The maximum incidence of electrophysiological abnormalities is reportedly 4–12 weeks after the onset of neurological symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>; therefore, the worsening of ulnar nerve sensory deficits in this case is presumed to be a clinical process. Because the NCS findings are not confirmed until 5 days after the onset of symptoms, a repeated NCS can help diagnose GBS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The absence of abnormal findings in spinal imaging is also useful for diagnosing GBS. The differential diagnoses of complications after spinal surgery often include spinal cord or root nerve injury during positioning, hemorrhage, recurrent disc herniation, infection, displacement of an implant, vascular insults (spinal cord ischemia/injury), or pharmacological toxicity, with a reported complication rate of 4–19% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4,5\\]</u>. In our review, reoperation was performed in seven (38.9%) patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22\\]</u>. Space-occupying lesions, such as an extradural hematoma or displaced operative implant, can be improved after a reoperation; however, complications might be worsened by an inappropriate operation when the origin of impairment is unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. When neurological deficits are observed after spinal surgery, GBS should be considered as a differential diagnosis when no abnormalities are present in the spine.\n\n【26】Although the finding of albuminocytologic dissociation in a CSF examination is helpful for the diagnosis of GBS, CSF examination is often difficult to perform after spinal surgery because of spinal changes, spinal hardware, wounds, or postoperative contamination. In this literature review, the rate of CSF examination after lumbar surgery was lower than that after cervical and thoracic vertebral surgery. The protein levels in CSF may be normal in early GBS, but they are elevated in 90% of patients by the end of the second week of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Albuminocytologic dissociation also occurs with compression of the spinal cord 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. This review suggests that the onset of postspinal surgery GBS is earlier than that of general GBS and that CSF testing may be performed early in the disease course. Therefore, normal or elevated CSF protein levels cannot be used to rule out or confirm a diagnosis of GBS. However, the absence of pleocytosis in CSF helps to differentiate GBS from other infectious, inflammatory, and malignant diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. If possible, CSF examination should be performed not only for the diagnosis of GBS but also for other differential diagnoses.\n\n【27】Our review of the literature also revealed cranial nerve involvement, autonomic dysfunction, and respiratory disorders as clinical features of GBS after spinal surgery. In this review, cranial nerve involvement was found in 50% of cases and was more common in GBS after spinal surgery than in general GBS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Umer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u> reported that if facial, bulbar, and neck weakness progresses within 5 days, impending respiratory failure can be expected. Autonomic dysfunction such as cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, hypotension, diarrhea, and ileus might occur in patients with GBS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>, and the presence of these signs can trigger clinicians’ recognition of GBS. In this review, gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common; in particular, diarrhea must be differentiated from infectious enteritis. This review also showed that mechanical ventilator management was needed in 50% of cases and was more frequent than in patients with general GBS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Clinicians should consider the appearance of cranial neurological, autonomic, and respiratory symptoms after spinal surgery.\n\n【28】Prompt administration of IVIg or PE is essential for neurologic recovery in patients with GBS. These treatments should ideally be started as soon as possible; a milder benefit has been shown with treatment that is started up to 4 weeks after symptom onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. Eight randomized controlled trials of the efficacy of corticosteroids for GBS showed no benefit, and treatment with oral corticosteroids was even shown to have a negative effect on outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. In this review, only one patient required persistent ventilator management and did not improve; although the remaining patients improved, some had sequelae of weakness, numbness, facial paralysis, and dysphagia. Because no clear treatment strategy for GBS after spinal surgery has been reported, we herein propose a diagnostic flowchart for this disease .\n\n【29】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【30】GBS after spinal surgery is a rare neurologic complication that presents unique diagnostic challenges. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment will prevent GBS from progressing to a life-threatening status. When patients exhibit unexplained weakness, areflexia, and numbness of the extremities 1–3 weeks after spinal surgery, the absence of abnormal findings in spinal imaging should be confirmed first. In patients without postoperative spinal changes, an NCS has priority regardless of whether CSF testing is available.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In the case of delayed facial palsy, the alarming symptom occurs several days or even weeks after uneventful surgery. The mechanism of the neural dysfunction is not readily defined. Surgical stress, intraoperative trauma, or laceration of the chorda tympani nerve with a resultant retrograde facial nerve edema can all be provoking etiological factors. A dehiscent bony facial canal or a multiple microporotic fallopian canal (microtrauma or laser effect) can also contribute to the development of this rare phenomenon. The most popular theory related to the explanation of delayed facial palsy at present is the reactivation of dormant viruses. Both the thermal effect of the laser and the elevation of the tympanomeatal flap can reactivate viruses resting inside the ganglion geniculi, facial nerve, or facial nuclei. The authors report the case histories of a 55-year-old female, and a 45-year-old male who presented with a delayed facial palsy following laser stapedotomy. The clinical characteristics, the therapeutic options, and the possibility of prevention are discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Delayed facial palsy occurring some days or weeks following uneventful stapedectomy or stapedotomy is a rare symptom with a favorable prognosis. The phenomenon was first described in 1973 by Althaus and House 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, who observed 5 cases (0.2%) among 2307 stapedectomy cases in their department. Overall, fewer than 40 cases have been reported in the literature. Shea performed 14,449 stapedectomies during four decades of ear surgery and encountered delayed facial paralysis in 11 cases (0.07%) within that period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Ng and Maceri reported the first 2 cases in the literature following laser stapedotomy in 1999 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Facial nerve palsy may occur either immediately or after some delay following stapes surgery. Immediate palsy may be due to local anesthetics and may regress within a few hours. Intraoperative severe surgical trauma or transection of the facial nerve can also cause complete facial paralysis immediately. Bonkowsky et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> observed delayed facial palsy that developed only 48–72 days after surgery, whereas in other literature reports the paralysis began even 5–16 days postoperatively, with complete recovery being achieved within 11–70 days in the vast majority of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】To date, out of 149 surgeries, 2 cases (0,01%) of delayed facial paralysis have occurred among the KTP laser stapedotomies performed at our department since 2006. Both patients recovered fully. The clinical characteristics, the therapeutic options, and the possibility of prevention are discussed below.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report 1\n\n【7】A 52-year-old female presented at our department with a bilateral progressive hearing loss in January 2010. Microotoscopic examination showed a normal eardrum and tympanic cavity, and audiometry revealed a conductive hearing loss on both sides; on the right, the average air-bone gap (ABG) was a mean of 34 dB on 0.5-1-2-3 kHz, while on the left side the mean ABG was 32 dB. The Carhart notch was present on both sides, and the mean bone conduction threshold was 5 dB on 0.5-1-2-3 kHz. The stapedial reflex was absent on both sides, while the multiple-frequency tympanogram indicated a resonance frequency of 1000 Hz on the left and of 1100 Hz resonance on the right side.\n\n【8】Explorative tympanotomy performed because of the suspicion of stapes fixation revealed that the stapes were indeed fixed. KTP laser stapedotomy was carried out on the left side as described earlier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, whereby the stapes superstructure was removed, and a self-crimping heat memory Nitinol piston was implanted to reconstruct the ossicular chain. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 3 following surgery. On postoperative day 8, the patient developed parageusia and pain around the right ear after awakening. House-Brackmann grade II facial palsy later developed on the operated side . No signs of either acute external otitis or acute otitis media were detected, and the blood tests demonstrated normal parameters. Following admission, the patient received 60 mg of methylprednisolone daily (Medrol, Pfizer), which was gradually tapered off in 3 weeks. Acyclovir (Zovirax, Sanofi Aventis) was administered orally for 2 weeks.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Eight days following stapedotomy, House-Brackmann grade II facial palsy is observed on the right side: teeth showing (a) and lip rounding (b).</u>\n\n【10】The patient gradually recovered, the facial nerve function improved, and the ear pain and the parageusia had regressed by postoperative day 36 . The audiometric evaluation revealed an ABG < 10 dB on 0.5-1-2-3 kHz, while the mean bone conduction threshold had improved by 5 dB relative to the preoperative results.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Thirty-six days following stapes surgery: the facial nerve function is intact, teeth showing (a) and lip rounding (b).</u>\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Case Report 2\n\n【13】A 45-year-old male developed a progressive bilateral hearing loss in January 2011. His ability to understand speech understanding gradually deteriorated. Examinations in April 2011 suggested stapes fixation, but he refused explorative tympanotomy. At the following visit during the summer of 2013, the microotoscopic examination indicated a normal eardrum on both sides. Audiometry revealed a mixed hearing loss bilaterally; on the right side, the bone conduction threshold was a mean of 20 dB, and the air conduction threshold was a mean of 55 dB (35 dB ABG) on 0.5-1-2-3 kHz, while on the left side the bone conduction threshold was a mean of 25 dB and the air conduction threshold was a mean of 45 dB (20 dB ABG). The Carhart notch was present on both sides (2 kHz). The stapedial reflex was absent bilaterally, while the multiple-frequency tympanogram revealed a resonance frequency of 1250 Hz on the left and of 1750 Hz on the right side.\n\n【14】In September 2013, the patient underwent an uneventful KTP laser stapedotomy on the right side, while the ossicular chain was reconstructed with a self-crimping heat memory NiTiBOND piston. On postoperative day 13, he suffered House-Brackmann grade III facial palsy on the right side while shaving . The symptom was accompanied by a slight pain in the right ear. No signs of either acute external otitis or acute otitis media were detected, and the blood tests showed normal parameters. By postoperative day 42, the patient had recovered completely  following Medrol and Acyclovir therapy administered in the same manner as described in case 1, and the audiometric evaluation revealed a mean of 5 dB ABG on 0.5-1-2-3 kHz, while the mean bone conduction threshold had improved by 5 dB.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Thirteen days following stapedotomy, House-Brackmann grade III facial palsy is observed on the right side: teeth showing (a) and lip rounding (b).</u>\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Forty-two days following stapes surgery, the facial nerve function is intact: teeth showing (a) and lip rounding (b).</u>\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Delayed facial palsy occurring a few days or weeks following uneventful stapes surgery is an alarming symptom but generally with a favorable prognosis. There is some disagreement among authors as to the explanation of this phenomenon.\n\n【19】Zohar and Laurian hypothesized that such a Bell palsy-like condition may be provoked by surgical stress, assuming that this was reinforced by the fact that patients presenting with facial palsy generally exhibited trigeminal sensory deficits on the same side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Surgical trauma to a dehiscent facial canal in the tympanic cavity may also lead to edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and consequential paralysis of the facial nerve. Paulsen presented a case where reexploration was indicated due to facial nerve palsy that developed within 24 hours postoperatively; extensive edema in a dehiscent facial canal was reported to have dislocated the implanted prosthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Kaplan observed that microscopic dehiscence may occur in the medial part of the facial canal near the oval window, while the bony coverage of the canal is apparently intact. During surgery, tearing of the chorda tympani may lead to retrograde edema, and the heat effect of the laser can additionally provoke edema formation according to the macroscopic dehiscences in cases of laser-assisted stapes surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the past decade however the experience of Gerlinger et al. was somewhat different: they often found that the facial nerve was dehiscent, or laser vaporization of a cholesteatoma sac was requisite near the oval window 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【21】In the event of a dehiscent nerve canal, immediate facial palsy is indicative of neurotmesis or axonotmesis following either laser-assisted operations or cold technical manipulations. The favorable prognosis of delayed palsies has demonstrated the presence of neurapraxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Recent publications suggest that the most reasonable explanation for delayed palsy is the reactivation of dormant viral infections (varicella zoster, herpes simplex 1-2, or Epstein-Barr). Herpes zoster or herpes simplex virus can undergo reactivation for either local or systemic reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This explanation seems to be confirmed by the occasional occurrence of facial nerve palsy following acoustic neuroma operations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Surgical stress may provoke herpes simplex reactivation in dermatomes remote from the surgical site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Spine surgeons have reported the reactivation of herpes virus in the surrounding dermatomes following surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Viral reactivation may also follow local trauma of the skin branches of the facial nerve subsequent to the elevation of the tympanomeatal flap in any type of ear surgery (tympanoplasty, meatoplasty, etc.). Shea Jr. and Ge reported elevated virus-specific anti-IgG and IgM levels in a patient with delayed facial nerve palsy following stapedectomy, which appears to support the virus theory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Sugita et al. recentlyidentified herpes simplex virus particles in the geniculate ganglion, the facial nerve, and the nuclei of the facial nerve in a novel mouse model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Facial nerve palsy was caused by the inoculation of these viruses through either the posterior part of the auricle or the anterior third of the tongue of the mice via the sensory branches of the facial nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Gadolinium-contrast MRI demonstrated significantly higher enhancement in the distal part of the internal ear canal, the labyrinth, the tympanic part and the geniculate ganglion in patients with Bell’s palsy, as compared with the control group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>. Cohen et al. reported corresponding contrast-enhanced MRI results in 2 patients with delayed facial nerve palsy following stapes surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Our cases occurred after laser-assisted stapedotomy. Fewer than 40 reports can be found that involve conventional or laser-assisted stapes surgery. The facial nerve canal in patients was apparently intact, and the surgical technique was standard. The laser equipment settings were as usual 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The history of the patients did not reveal frequent herpes infections. The lesson learned from our cases is that, besides an appropriate knowledge of laser physics, it is indispensable to apply cooling intraoperatively and to prefer cold instrumentation where a laser is not necessary (e.g. cutting the stapedial tendon). It appears essential to take into account the effect of scattering from the bare bony surface during laser vaporization and coagulation which may result in undesired heating of the facial nerve canal.\n\n【25】Despite the generally favorable prognosis of such cases, we do not rule out the administration of steroid and antiviral medication in the light of the theory of virus reactivation as the explanation of delayed facial nerve palsy. The need for surgical decompression of the facial nerve almost never arises. In cases of complete facial nerve palsy, repeated electroneurography should be considered. Contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended.\n\n【26】The question remains open as to whether or not to administer antiviral treatment preoperatively to a patient with a history of frequent herpes infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【27】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【28】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>Delayed facial palsy may occur several days or weeks following uneventful stapedectomy, stapedotomy, or tympanoplasty. The prognosis is favorable in almost all cases.通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>Present knowledge suggests that the most reasonable etiology is viral reactivation (herpes zoster, herpes simplex, or Epstein-Barr).通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>In the event of a delayed palsy, acute infection must be ruled out.通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>Gadolinium-contrast MRI is recommended (to confirm tumor formation and higher enhancement in the fundus of the internal ear canal, the labyrinth, and the tympanic part).通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>The lowest possible energy density should be applied, the use of high output should be avoided, and the heat energy generated during laser stapedotomy should be as low as possible.通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>A defocused laser beam may scatter from the bare bony surface and may reach the occasionally osteoporotic facial canal.通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>Gelfoam saturated with cold saline may be beneficial if applied to the facial canal, the round, and the oval window (heat absorption and minimal scattering).通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u>The administration of antiviral medication and steroid may be advantageous following the development of delayed facial palsy.通用删除7(英):<u>(9)</u>Prophylactic antiviral treatment may be considered preoperatively if the patient presents with a history of frequent herpes simplex infections.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is currently not routine practice to assess the functional response to these agents. However, concern over functional hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel has led to widespread uptake of prasugrel and ticagrelor as the default P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor after stent implantation in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Here we report, for the first time, 3 cases in which patients who have had ST exhibit hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Stent thrombosis (ST) is a major complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), occurring in 2.0–2.9% of patients within 22 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although uncommon, ST is associated with significant mortality of up to 45% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Dual antiplatelet therapy (APT) with aspirin and P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor has become the default strategy in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation to reduce the risk of ST. However, a cohort of patients may have an inadequate functional response to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u> and are more likely to sustain ischaemic events including ST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】There is particular concern about clopidogrel in this regard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. The established link between functional hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel and ischaemic events, including ST, in patients receiving coronary stents has triggered the development of more potent and faster-acting P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors. Two large randomised trials have demonstrated reduction in ischaemic endpoints for prasugrel and ticagrelor when compared to clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing PCI, albeit at the price of increased bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. In response to these data and earlier studies demonstrating quicker onset and more potent and more homogeneous responses of healthy volunteers and stable patients to prasugrel and ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel, many PCI centres in the UK have switched from clopidogrel to either prasugrel or ticagrelor as their default. Interestingly the incidence of prasugrel hyporesponsiveness is estimated to be 25% using flow cytometric analysis of intraplatelet vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation in ACS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In the CREST registry, out of 6 patients who were found to be hyporesponsive to prasugrel, only 3 responded adequately to ticagrelor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】We present for the first time 3 cases who had experienced definite ST after drug eluting stent (DES) implantation who demonstrated functional hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, using a previously well validated test, short thromboelastography (sTEG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–15\\]</u>. sTEG uses a novel parameter, percentage clotting inhibition (%CI) in the AA or ADP channel for clotting inhibition by aspirin or P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, respectively. The formula for %CI by aspirin is and for %CI by P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors is 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Threshold %CI of <50 in the AA channel and <30 in the ADP channel was used to define hyporesponsiveness to aspirin and P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, respectively.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】Patient 1 is a 74-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previous anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with a single drug eluting stent (DES) in the circumflex artery. He presented with proximal stent occlusion 2043 days after his index PCI while on aspirin 75 mg once daily. He was successfully treated with plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) and bare metal stent (BMS) insertion. Subsequently he underwent platelet function testing using sTEG. Initially our patient was started on aspirin 150 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. Forty-two days later, the assay revealed an adequate response to aspirin (%CI 71) but suboptimal response to clopidogrel (%CI 17). Therefore, prasugrel 5 mg daily was commenced as patient was borderline for age group with no initial loading. Once more the reading showed inadequate response to prasugrel 5 mg daily (%CI −7) after 63 days of treatment and the dose was uptitrated to 10 mg daily. Subsequent test, 105 days later, revealed suboptimal response again (%CI 9). As a result, the patient was commenced on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily without initial loading and retested after 85 days of treatment. Similarly, his reading revealed hyporesponse (%CI 1) . Due to development of dyspnoea while on ticagrelor, the patient was finally left on prasugrel 10 mg daily for life. After this episode, he was treated with cardiac resynchronisation therapy and defibrillation due to severe ischaemic cardiomyopathy but is currently alive, having suffered no further ST or other ischaemic events.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Short thromboelastography traces showing adequate response to aspirin 150 mg daily and hyporesponse to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors in first patient.

He represented with anterior STEMI due to ST 795 days after his index admission while on aspirin 75 mg daily. He was treated with intravascular ultrasound guided POBA. Platelet function testing using sTEG demonstrated an inadequate response to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor inhibitors. Initial response to aspirin 75 mg daily appeared adequate (%CI 61); however response to clopidogrel 75 mg daily was suboptimal (%CI 21) after 36 days of treatment. As a result, the patient was commenced on prasugrel 10 mg daily with no initial loading. Testing, after 70 days of treatment, again revealed hyporesponsiveness (%CI 17). Finally, ticagrelor 90 mg bd was introduced, with no initial loading, with similar effect (%CI −21) after 263 days of treatment . Ultimately, he was maintained on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for life and has suffered no further ST or ischaemic events to date.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Short thromboelastography traces showing adequate response to aspirin 75 mg daily and hyporesponse to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors in second patient.

He represented 671 days later with ST while on aspirin 150 mg daily. Both vessels required treatment due to acute thrombotic occlusion and four further DES were implanted. He was proven to have adequate response to aspirin 150 mg daily (%CI 82) but suboptimal response to thienopyridines. Clopidogrel 75 mg with inadequate response (%CI 8) after 19 days of treatment was replaced by prasugrel 10 mg daily with no initial loading, with again suboptimal response (%CI 9) after 56 days of usage. Finally, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily was commenced without initial loading but similarly was proven to have inadequate response (%CI 24) after 21 days of treatment. As response to ticagrelor was better than to prasugrel, the decision was made for him to remain on ticagrelor for 12 months. Patient 3 has suffered no further ischaemic events to our knowledge.\n\n【12】The %CIn(ADP) for each of our patients are demonstrated as in Figure 3.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Variability in % clotting inhibition following medication adjustments in patients found to be hyporesponsive at initial and successive short TEG tests following stent thrombosis. Horizontal dotted line signifies a sufficient response.</u>\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Our case series demonstrates three cases of patients with acute stent thrombosis who were found to be hyporesponsive to all three commonly available P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a series of such cases has been described. Two previously published case reports have illustrated patients with dual thienopyridine resistance to clopidogrel and prasugrel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. In both cases, the patient was subsequently shown to have an adequate response to the ticagrelor. Orban et al. suggested that the response to ticagrelor may be due to its properties as an active drug, compared with prasugrel and clopidogrel which are prodrugs requiring hepatic cytochrome bioactivation prior to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Based upon both early studies reporting superior potency, speed of onset and consistency of responses to prasugrel and ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in both volunteers and stable patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>, and subsequent large scale randomised trials, in many PCI centres, prasugrel and ticagrelor have become the default P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> agent. The assumption from some interventionalists is that prasugrel and ticagrelor are not associated with functional hyporesponsiveness (also known as “resistance”). However, recent data suggest that functional resistance does indeed occur in association with these agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Our case series describe for the first time the concept of functional resistance to all three commonly available P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors. These data were obtained using short TEG, a well described and validated modification of TEG platelet mapping assay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–13\\]</u>. Our group has previously described the reproducibility of sTEG and has demonstrated the value of comparing the ADP-induced clotting response to that achieved using kaolin stimulation. This method has the advantage that there is a built-in reference, both numerical and visual, of the strength of the clot in response to ADP compared to the maximum clot strength achieved by kaolin.

Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy was performed, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed Ki-67 and p53 mutations to be negative in this case. Signet ring gastric cancer has long been thought to confer a worse prognosis than other forms of gastric cancer; however, our case did not progress to advanced gastric cancer for 15 months.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Signet ring cell gastric cancer (SRGC) is a histologic diagnosis based on microscopic characteristics as described by the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. SRGC cells are characterized by abundant intracytoplasmic mucins, ample and clear cytoplasm, and eccentrically located nuclei compressed by intracytoplasmic mucins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The clinicopathological characteristics of SRGC are known to differ from other types of gastric cancer. Some reports have suggested a higher rate of formation of multiple gastric cancers if the primary lesion is SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In general, SRGC is believed to behave more aggressively and have a worse prognosis than other forms of gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>; however, recent studies from Asia have demonstrated that when adjusted for stage, this might not be the case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Early SRGC does not demonstrate more frequent lymph node (LN) metastases than other types of gastric cancer; improved survival has been reported for early stages of SRGC compared with other types of gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, but relatively worse survival in later stages of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Once early SRGC evolves into advanced gastric cancer, the diffusely infiltrating characteristics of SRGC may involve the entire stomach, resulting in what is known as linitis plastica, which is associated with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thus, the idea that signet ring cell histology conveys a worse prognosis might not always be correct.\n\n【5】Here, we report a rare case of SRGC in a male patient whose flat pale mucosal lesion was endoscopically unchanged 15 months after the initial endoscopic examination, when he was diagnosed with intramucosal SRGC.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 58-year-old man who had suffered from appetite loss underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) during a medical check-up in October 2011. A flat, pale, mucosal lesion (5 mm in diameter; Figure 1(a)) on the posterior wall of the distal gastric body was observed. Chromoendoscopy with indigo-carmine dye added to acetic acid did not show any staining indicating gastric neoplasia, so we planned to repeat EGD 1 year later. The herbal medicine rikkunshito was administered for 4 weeks, and the patient’s appetite gradually improved. The next EGD to which the patient consented, taken in January 2013, revealed the flat, pale, mucosal lesion to be the same size as it had been in October 2011 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>; it was not enhanced by indigo-carmine dye staining added to acetic acid 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. Additionally, image-enhanced EGD using the narrow-band light method did not reveal any findings of significance (data not shown). At this time, we took a biopsy to pathologically diagnose and characterize this gastric lesion, which allowed diagnosis of SRGC 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(d))</u>. The endoscopic diagnosis was Type 0-IIb in accordance with the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma (JCGC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, which is a manual that describes the classification of cancer according to its stage and histology, classifies its curability via surgery and the extent of lymphadenectomy, and evaluates responses to chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Computed tomography (CT) showed fluffing surrounding the gastric body and no distinct regional LN or distant metastases . The fluffing indicated inflammatory changes suspected to be serosal invasion from the gastric tumor. Laboratory results were within normal limits and the serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal. We diagnosed this lesion as clinical(c) T1(M), cN0, cM0, and cStage IA according to the JCGC. The CT finding of inflammatory changes surrounding the gastric body suggested a risk of serosal invasion, so laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy was performed rather than endoscopic resection. The regional lymph nodes (LN stations 1, 3, 4d, 5, 6, 7, 8a, 9, and 12a) were resected. The surgical specimen revealed signet ring cells alone, limited to the mucosa without lymphovascular involvement or ulcerative findings 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a)\\-3(b))</u>. The lesion was 5 mm in diameter, and the resection margin was free of tumor cells. Portions of the resected regional LNs did not include metastatic cancer cells. Thus, this lesion was diagnosed as pathological (p)T1(M), ly0, v0, pN0, pM0, R0, and pStage IA according to the JCGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis showed that tumor cells were negative for both Ki-67 删除1:<u>(Figure 4(a))</u> and p53 删除1:<u>(Figure 4(b))</u>. Eleven months after surgery, the patient was in good condition and disease-free without any signs of tumor recurrence based on the latest follow-up EGD and CT examinations.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Endoscopic examination before treatment.

Discussion\n\n【13】Early SRGC tends to be superficial and large, so it is usually diagnosed earlier than gastric cancer of other histological types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. At the first endoscopy (October 2011), we could detect a small, flat, pale mucosa in the stomach. Chromoendoscopy with indigo-carmine dye added to acetic acid improves the detection rates of early gastric cancer and precancerous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In this case, indigo-carmine dye added to acetic acid staining did not show any signs indicating gastric neoplasia, so we did not take any biopsies in the initial EGD. Therefore, it is unknown whether signet ring cells had been histologically localized in this gastric lesion in the initial EGD. The next endoscopic images taken in January 2013 showed that the lesion was unaltered in size and shape; satellite lesions were not seen, and biopsy was carried out at this time. Unexpectedly, the biopsy revealed SRGC histology. It is unknown whether SRGC usually arises from a preexisting precancerous lesion or as a so-called de novo carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Conventional endoscopy and chromoendoscopy did not show any alterations in size or shape of this gastric lesion for 15 months between the first and second examinations, and this tumor showed only signet ring cells without accompanying adenoma or other types of cancer cells. Thus, there was a low possibility that a preexistent precancerous lesion had turned into SRGC in the intramucosal layer between the first and second examinations; therefore, it is likely that signet ring cells might have been localized in this gastric lesion in the initial EGD.\n\n【14】In general, Ki-67 and p53 are highly expressed in SRGC cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Ki-67 is an antigen that corresponds to a nuclear nonhistone protein expressed by cells in the proliferative phases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Ki-67 labeling is relatively low in normal gastric epithelium (<15%), while Ki-67 labeling of primary SRGC is high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. p53 is a nuclear protein thought to be involved in the control of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and maintenance of genomic stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The immunohistochemical demonstration of p53 highly suggests a p53 gene mutation and malignant potential of tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. While normal epithelium never expresses p53, p53 is highly expressed in SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The expression levels of Ki-67 and p53 in early SRGCs are still unknown. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Ki-67 and p53 mutations to be negative in this case, which might be the reason why it had not progressed to advanced gastric cancer for 15 months.\n\n【15】Recently, endoscopic submucosal dissection has been carefully applied in early SRGCs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, there are no specific guidelines for the endoscopic treatment of SRGCs. The differences in outcomes between early- and late-stage SRGC described above could reflect the aggressive resection strategies. Furthermore, it must be emphasized that forming satellite lesions is another characteristic of SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, for which extending endoscopic resection criteria is inappropriate. On the other hand, because there have been some reports that early SRGC carries a lower rate of LN metastasis, which is specifically related to recurrence of gastric cancer including SRGC, and better prognosis compared with advanced SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, it is possible that endoscopic resection can be performed on patients with small SRGC limited to the mucosa and with no LN metastasis or satellite lesions. CT indicated that there was a risk of serosal invasion of the gastric body, so we judged that laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy, rather than endoscopic resection, was the most suitable treatment option to resect this gastric tumor completely. If serosal invasion had not been suspected, it might have been appropriate to treat this case with endoscopic resection such as endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection. The surveillance of LN metastasis in addition to other organs and the residual stomach for primary SRGC is particularly important after endoscopic resection or surgery. Moreover, both endoscopic follow-up and biopsy are necessary to find SRGCs at early stages before diffuse infiltration can occur.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The laboratory analysis showed moderate hypoosmolar hyponatremia (Na: 132 mmol/L, osmolality: 239 mOsm/L), normal sodium excretion (<20 mmol/L), and a high urinary osmolality (415 mOsm/L). Later, she deteriorated with seizures and deeper hyponatremia (Na: 113 mmol/L) and so was moved to the critical care unit. At first, no obvious aetiology was found, the patient was euvolemic, as she was well hydrated and lacked concerning findings of heart failure, renal disease, or liver cirrhosis. A syndrome of inappropriate diuresis (SIAD) was proposed, and corrective measures were started immediately to reduce her hyponatremia, including restriction of fluid intake. The administration of intravenous hypertonic saline solution permitted normal neurological status to be restored and corrected the sodium concentration but induced reversible acute renal failure. Further investigation revealed that the patient had ingested 8 g ibuprofen two days before admission. After other aetiologies were ruled out, drug-induced SIAD due to ibuprofen was the most likely diagnosis for this patient. SIAD-associated hyponatremia and acute renal failure are rare side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly in young people. Therefore, this case may represent a unique case of NSAID-induced SIAD and highlight the need to obtain thorough medication histories and exclude all other potential causes in hyponatremic patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The syndrome of inappropriate diuresis (SIAD) is the most common disorder of sodium and water balance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and must be distinguished from several other types of hyponatremia because each requires different management. The most common causes are increased hypothalamic production of ADH, due to neuropsychiatric disorders, drugs, pulmonary diseases, HIV infection, or ectopic production of ADH which occurs in carcinoma, lymphosarcoma, or leukaemia.\n\n【4】Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug used to treat moderate pain and/or fever. The recommended dose varies with body mass and indication. A dose of 400 mg to 1200 mg per day (i.e. 17 to 36 mg/kg) is considered the maximum amount for over-the-counter use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite a very wide use, ibuprofen is rarely associated with severe toxicity. Drugs as NSAIDs cause SIAD by enhancing the action of ADH at the renal tubule level. However, the proportion of drug-induced SIAD resulting from NSAID is less than 0.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. An idiopathic form of the syndrome has been reported, but poorly documented. Also, 5% of SIAD is thought to be idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and is a discrete category of SIAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Maybe a proportion of these are actually ibuprofen induced. In the USA, from 1988 to 1990, 50 614 intoxications with NSAIDs were described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, predominantly with ibuprofen. 131 patients (0.26%) had major outcomes with 10 deaths (drug overdose). In Great Britain in 2003, enquiries about the management of patients possibly suffering from ibuprofen overdose account for over 5% of the total enquiries received by the London Centre of the UK National Poisons Information Service. In each of the 1033 cases, there were complicating factors related to other drugs and/or other diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Regarding the cases described in the literature, elderly and comorbid patients develop drug-induced SIAD more than young people. We report a rare case of a 30-year-old healthy and euvolemic woman who developed severe hyponatremia and acute renal failure after absorption of 152 mg/kg ibuprofen. After a thorough investigation and exclusion of more common causes, SAID was thought to be drug induced.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 30-year-old woman was admitted to the infectious diseases unit for fever and nausea (without vomiting) evolving over 5 days and resistant to analgesic and antipyretic drugs (acetaminophen). She was not anorexic, had no significant past medical history, under no medication, and she denied any medical or toxic ingestions. Temperature was 37°C, pulse rate was 100 b/min, and blood pressure was 150/70 mmHg. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormality, and EKG and chest X-ray were normal. Laboratory analysis only showed a mild biological inflammation (c-reactive protein: 8 mg/L) and a moderate hyponatremia (132 mmol/L). The results for the remaining biological tests were in the normal range (potassium: 3.8 mmol/L, chlorine: 96 mmol/L, urea: 2.8 mmol/L, and creatinine: 55 mmol/L). Urinalysis showed no abnormality and additional urine toxicological testing exclude drugs abuse. The next day, she complained of nausea, headache, and diffuse pain evocative of meningism.\n\n【7】The cerebrospinal fluid was acellular without biochemical abnormality. A brain MRI excluded an intracranial bleed or other focal abnormality, whereas an EEG showed signs of encephalopathy. Biochemistry tests were within normal limits, except serum sodium levels (113 mmol/L) and osmolality (239 mOsm/L). Natriuresis and urinary osmolality were preserved (137 mmol/L and 415 mOsm/L, resp.). On day 2, despite normal saline perfusion (2 litres in 24 hours) and presumptive antiinfective treatments (amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and aciclovir), the patient convulsed and was transferred to intensive care unit. Her natremia fell to 105 mmol/L on day 3 (osmolality: 231 mOsml/L). Cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels were normal (random cortisol and ACTH stimulation test); aldosterone levels were 3 times higher than normal and vasopressin (ADH) was within normal limits (2.39 pg/mL). Fluid restriction was undertaken and sodium levels reached 124 mmol/L in 24 hours. While neurological disorders were improving, acute renal failure occurred (creatinine levels rose from 36 to 259 μmol/L, BUN rose to 6.9 mmol/L), so fluid restriction was stopped. On day 6, the patient was apyretic and renal function was restored with natremia reaching 132 mmol/L. Several aetiologies were ruled out (viral, bacterial, and toxic, including heavy metals), and there was no evidence of psychogenic polydypsia (nursing staff did not report any excessive drinking). She had no known cause of antidiuresis. There was no argument for hypervolemia (congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis), hypovolemia (haemorrhage, gastroenteritis, or diuretic abuse), renal failure, or adrenal failure. Thyroid function tests and chest radiography gave normal results. Neuropsychiatry disorders were excluded, as well as pulmonary diseases (tuberculosis or lung abscess), HIV infection, meningitis, encephalitis, and ectopic production of ADH (carcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease …). Further investigations led to the discovery that the patient had ingested more than 20 tablets of ibuprofen 400 mg (representing 152 mg/kg) for back pain in the two days before admission to hospital. The outcome was favourable and the patient left hospital 12 days later.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Hyponatremia is a common disorder, usually more prevalent in older adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. SIAD is the most common form of normovolaemic or dilutional hyponatremia. The diagnosis of SIAD is based on five criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>: hypotonic hyponatremia (natremia < 135 mmol/L), persistent urinary sodium excretion (>30 mmol/L), plasmatic osmolality < 280 mOsmol/L, urine osmolality in excess of plasma osmolality, absence of oedema, or volume depletion, and normal renal, adrenal, or thyroid function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Clinical features are nonspecific, mainly neurological, and can threaten life. The severity of symptoms is related to both the absolute serum sodium concentration and its rapid decrease, particularly if greater than 0.5 mmol/L/h, which most likely explains the seizure activity in our patient. The management of SIAD patients may include efficient treatment of the primitive disease and removal of excess total body water. Fluid restriction remains the safe mainstay of hyponatremia management, as applied to our patient. Unfortunately, a convulsive episode associated with severe hyponatremia (113 mmol/L) occurred, requiring its rapid correction, as recommended by most guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Inappropriate antidiuresis is usually due to the administration or endogeneous production of ADH, causing renal water reabsorption and resulting in hyponatremia with increasing extracellular fluid volume. Endogenous production can be either eutopic or ectopic, induced by a wide variety of diseases (cancers, neurological disorders, and lung diseases), drugs, or injuries . Whereas some drugs are implied in ADH stimulation (carbamazepine and vincristine), other drugs (NSAIDs and chlorpropamide) enhance its action at the renal tubule level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> or play a role in prostaglandin inhibition (such as ibuprofen). For the reported patient, we ruled out many causes of SIAD after analysis of her history, physical examination, and initial medical record. Ibuprofen-induced SIAD was the most likely diagnosis despite her young age. NSAIDs can adversely affect the kidney because they can induce sodium retention and antagonize the action of diuretics, impair free-water clearance, and cause hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Similar cases have been described in the past, but the patients suffered from chronic diseases such as advanced chronic renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, von Willebrand’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>, or were extremely old (>80 y) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Table 1 Most common causes of SIADH.\n\n【12】Whereas over-the-counter antipyretics and/or analgesics are relatively safe for adults, cyclooxygenase inhibitors may induce a wide variety of side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, which usually concern elderly patients or are found in critical situations such as hypovolemia or anesthesia. Except for newborns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>, acute renal failure is rarely described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>, but the low report of cases is probably underestimated since renal failure is often moderate and diuresis preserved. The Naranjo criteria classify the probability that an adverse event is related to drug therapy based on a list of weighted questions, which examine factors such as the temporal association of drug administration and event occurrence, alternative causes for the event, drug levels, dose-response relationships, and previous patient experience with the medication. In our case report, the score was five, so the adverse drug reaction was classified as probable. But the Naranjo criteria do not take into account drug-drug interactions. Moreover, other causes as back pain, an undiagnosed viral infection, are also plausible explanations of what happened.\n\n【13】This case stresses the importance in asking about history specifically pertaining to analgesics as commonly patients may not be open about the use of these medications because they are over-the-counter, easily accessible and viewed to be benign ingestions by the general public.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】This clinical case stresses the importance that clinicians should give to recognising NSAIDs as a potential cause for patients who present with SIAD, even where there are no risk factors such as extreme age or renal failure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of a tumor size reduction of a ruptured pheochromocytoma after transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). A 60-year-old Japanese woman was referred to the emergency department of another hospital with a sudden onset of left lateral pain. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed adrenal hemorrhage with a 5.7 cm adrenal mass, and she was transferred to our hospital for treatment. Considering that she had marked hypertension (193/115 mmHg), we made a provisional diagnosis of left lateral pain due to a ruptured pheochromocytoma. She underwent TAE, and the hemorrhage was successfully controlled. She was started on oral doxazosin for hypertension. The dose of doxazosin was increased to the extent that orthostatic hypotension did not develop, and blood pressure was well controlled. After discharge, the tumor size gradually decreased to approximately 1.0 cm within six months. Six months after TAE, elective laparoscopic surgery was performed, and the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. We observed a decrease in the size of the ruptured pheochromocytoma after TAE. To reduce the risk of laparoscopic adrenal surgery, it may be useful to monitor the size of a ruptured pheochromocytoma after TAE before deciding the surgery time.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pheochromocytoma is a relatively rare catecholamine-producing neuroendocrine tumor that presents with various clinical symptoms such as hypertension, headache, palpitations, and sweating. Pheochromocytoma is reported to account for 0.2% of all hypertension cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The spontaneous rupture of adrenal tumors is a very rare condition; however, pheochromocytoma is the most common tumor that develops spontaneous adrenal hemorrhage with associated masses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In the case of a ruptured pheochromocytoma, emergent surgery is associated with a high mortality rate; however, previously reported cases have shown that elective surgery after appropriate management may lead to good outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In the current study, we report an extremely rare case of a spontaneous rupture of an adrenal pheochromocytoma in which transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was applied for hemostasis, and elective laparoscopic resection was performed after tumor shrinkage.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 60-year-old Japanese woman with no medical history was admitted to the emergency department of another hospital with a chief complaint of severe left lateral pain. She had no family history of endocrine disease including pheochromocytoma. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a left 5.7 cm adrenal mass with a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage , and the patient was transferred to our hospital for multidisciplinary treatment.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Computed tomography findings on admission. Contrast-enhanced coronal abdominal computed tomography showed a left 5.7 cm adrenal mass (red dots) and a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage.</u>\n\n【7】She was 149 cm tall and weighed 49 kg. On presentation, her vital signs and physical findings were as follows: body temperature of 37.3°C, pulse rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 193/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18/min, and Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. These findings strongly suggested that her pain was caused by a ruptured pheochromocytoma. Laboratory tests revealed that her white blood count was 28180/μL, hemoglobin was 11.2 g/dL, and hepatic enzymes were normal. However, her creatinine (Cre) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were 1.03 mg/dL and 43 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, which indicated decreased renal function. After arriving at our hospital, her blood pressure suddenly dropped to 62/44 mmHg. Ongoing hemorrhage was suspected because of sudden hypotension. Under a presumptive diagnosis of active bleeding from a ruptured left adrenal tumor suspected of pheochromocytoma, we decided to perform TAE to prevent the further deterioration of hemodynamics. Angiography was performed using a right femoral approach and showed that the tumor blood flow was supplied from a branch of the left adrenal artery. Thereafter, TAE was selectively performed for the left inferior adrenal artery by using gelatin sponge particles and coiling. No further tumor vascularity was demonstrated by subsequent contrast injection. Her hemodynamics stabilized after TAE, and systolic blood pressure ranged from 150–170 mmHg. After admission, she was treated with intravenous nicardipine and oral doxazosin. Intravenous phentolamine was not administered to this patient because phentolamine was not available in our hospital.\n\n【8】On the second day of admission, hormonal assays were performed and showed markedly elevated levels of plasma metanephrine at 952 pg/mL (reference range <130 pg/mL), plasma normetanephrine at 3150 pg/mL (reference range <506 pg/mL), urinary metanephrine at 6.64 μg/mg Cr (reference range <0.2 μg/mg Cr), and urinary normetanephrine at 7.22 μg/mg Cr (reference range <0.3 μg/mg Cr). On the third day of admission, abdominal computed tomography was performed and showed a significant resolution of the retroperitoneal hematoma. She was discharged on day 11 after TAE without any symptoms. At discharge, the systolic blood pressure was improved to 130 mmHg or less by oral doxazosin 4 mg/day alone. On the day after discharge, an iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan was performed, and results showed only a significant left adrenal uptake.\n\n【9】She was followed up at an outpatient clinic, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging confirmed that the tumor size had spontaneously and gradually decreased. The tumor sizes were 3.1, 2.8, and 1.3 cm one month, three months, and five months after discharge, respectively . Tumor shrinkage prompted us to resect the tumor laparoscopically . Six months after TAE, laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was successfully performed with proper preoperative treatment by 7 mg/day of doxazosin. Pathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of an adrenal pheochromocytoma . The gross appearance of the resected tumor was 13 mm × 12 mm × 11 mm in size and was yellow and tan in color. Pathological examination revealed coagulative necrosis in the tumor, and the cytoplasm of the tumor cells was immunohistochemically positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and S100. The Ki67 labeling index was <1%. A score of five was obtained from the grading system for adrenal pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (histological pattern; large and irregular cell nest, one point; cellularity, high, two points; vascular or capsular invasion; presence, one point; and catecholamine type and noradrenaline type, one point) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

Urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine levels also showed a significant decrease. At the half-year follow-up, her postoperative course was uneventful without any recurrence of pheochromocytoma, and levels of plasma metanephrine and normetanephrine remained within normal ranges.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】In this case report, we described an extremely rare case of a spontaneous rupture of an adrenal pheochromocytoma in which TAE was applied for hemostasis, and elective laparoscopic resection was performed after tumor shrinkage.\n\n【16】Pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-secreting tumor of chromaffin cells. The major classic symptoms of pheochromocytoma are headache, palpitation, and diaphoresis with severe hypertension. However, some patients with pheochromocytoma are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>; in such cases, tumor rupture may be the initial manifestations of pheochromocytoma. Tumor rupture is an extremely rare complication of pheochromocytoma; however, it affects the circulation system profoundly and can be potentially lethal. The mortality rate of a ruptured pheochromocytoma is reported to be 34% in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Although the mechanism of rupture is unclear, high intracapsular pressure may cause the necrosis of a pheochromocytoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Elective surgery for a ruptured pheochromocytoma following pharmacological therapy has a low mortality rate. However, emergent surgery for a ruptured pheochromocytoma is associated with a high mortality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. TAE has recently been reported as a suitable option for a ruptured pheochromocytoma to achieve hemodynamic stabilization and permit elective surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. We successfully controlled the hemorrhage due to a ruptured pheochromocytoma after TAE. However, among the past cases of a ruptured pheochromocytoma, one case resulted in death even after TAE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In that case, TAE was performed 12 hours after the suspected of a ruptured pheochromocytoma, following the gradual decrease in blood pressure. Therefore, it is presumed that early treatment decision is required when diagnosing a ruptured pheochromocytoma.\n\n【17】In our case, the tumor size decreased after TAE. Upon admission to the hospital, the tumor size was 5.7 cm; however, consecutive radiological examinations demonstrated marked tumor shrinkage, and pathological examinations revealed a significant decrease to approximately 1.0 cm. This is the first report to demonstrate tumor shrinkage after TAE for a ruptured pheochromocytoma. The exact mechanisms of tumor shrinkage remain to be elucidated; however, starvation of blood supply by TAE and/or progressive necrosis due to spontaneous rupture may become a critical factor for the tumor shrinkage.\n\n【18】In this case, the preoperative large size of pheochromocytoma was considered to be a risk factor for intra- and postoperative complications. Bai et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> showed that the radiographic large size of pheochromocytoma was an independent risk factor for postoperative cardiovascular morbidity and a cut-off value of the tumor size was 6.05 cm. Kwon et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> also reported that the large size of pheochromocytoma was a risk factor for intraoperative hypertensive attack and a cut-off value of the tumor size was 4.25 cm and Liu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> showed that pheochromocytoma with tumor diameter greater than 5.00 cm was at risk of intraoperative massive blood loss. In this case, we worked closely with urologists to determine the surgery after confirming the sufficient shrinkage of the tumor and hematoma and the decrease in catecholamine levels. As a result, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was safely performed after tumor shrinkage. Elective surgery could be performed three months after discharge, based on the tumor size, the levels of catecholamines, and blood pressure; however, the corona virus 2019 pandemic forced to perform elective surgery at our hospital later than originally planned.\n\n【19】In our case, pathological findings suggested an intermediate risk of tumor metastasis but displayed no signs of recurrence during more than half a year of the postoperative follow-up period. Given that a recurrence of pheochromocytoma may occur even decades after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, further follow-ups will be mandatory for a long time in our case.\n\n【20】We reported a rare case in which significant tumor shrinkage was demonstrated after TAE for a ruptured pheochromocytoma. The tumor size monitoring may contribute to be a crucial determinant of timing of elective surgery in pheochromocytoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Cytokine production by tumor cells was suspected; both serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (117 pg/mL; normal: <57.5 pg/mL) and interleukin-6 (83.5 pg/mL; normal: <2.41 pg/mL) levels were high. Immunohistochemical examination of biopsy specimens showed positive staining with antigranulocyte colony-stimulating factor and anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibodies. Diagnosis of a tumor that produced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-6 was established. The patient was administered best supportive therapy since she was not eligible for surgical treatment because of her poor respiratory function.

Introduction\n\n【3】Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a cytokine associated with granulocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In recent years, it has been determined that leukocytosis in malignant tumors is caused by G-CSF production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Malignant tumors that produce G-CSF are designated as G-CSF-producing tumors that are found in various organs including lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, and gallbladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a known promoter of G-CSF and causes fever and elevated C-reactive protein levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Malignant tumors that produced IL-6 are designated as IL-6-producing tumors. Here we present a case of lung squamous cell carcinoma that produced both G-CSF and IL-6.\n\n【4】#### 2\\.

She had a history of smoking 15 cigarettes per day for 55 years but no history of alcohol consumption. On initial clinical examination, her weight was of 50.8 kg, height was 158 cm, body mass index was 20.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and BSA was 150 m<sup>2</sup>. Mild anemia was revealed in the palpebral conjunctiva. No abnormal murmur could be heard on auscultation although dry rales were heard in both lungs.\n\n【8】Laboratory test results demonstrated a markedly elevated white blood cell count (266 × 10<sup>2</sup>/μL; normal: 39–94 × 10<sup>2</sup>/μL) with 81% neutrophils, mild anemia (red blood cell count: 322 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; normal: 367–479 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; hemoglobin: 9.8 mg/dL; normal: 11.5–14.9 mg/dL), elevated platelet count (56.9 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; normal: 13–33 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL), mild renal dysfunction (serum creatinine: 0.96 mg/dL; normal: 0.47–0.79 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen: 23.4 mg/dL; normal: 7–20 mg/dL), mild hyponatremia (133 mEq/mL; normal: 137–146 mEq/mL), mild hypercalcium (11.4 mg/mL; normal: 8.4–10 mg/dL), and markedly elevated C-reactive protein level (14.0 mg/dL; normal: 0–0.3 mg/dL). The tumor marker squamous cell carcinoma antigen was also elevated (5.5 ng/mL; normal: 0–1.5 ng/mL).\n\n【9】Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed interstitial shadows in both lungs.

Therefore, the cooccurrence of a respiratory tract infection was suspected. The administration of antibiotics was initiated (sulbactam/ampicillin at 3.0 g/day for 6 days, and, subsequently, pazufloxacin at 1000 mg/day for 4 days).

After administering nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (loxoprofen sodium hydrate at 180 mg/day), her temperature returned to normal.\n\n【12】The cause of fever and elevated inflammatory reaction levels was suspected as cytokine production by tumor cells. Therefore, serum G-CSF and IL-6 levels were measured, which showed that both serum G-CSF (117 pg/mL; normal: <57.5 pg/mL) and IL-6 (83.5 pg/mL; normal: <2.41 pg/mL) levels were high. Immunohistochemical examination of biopsy specimens showed positive staining with anti-G-CSF monoclonal and anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a) and 3(b))</u>.

Chemotherapy was recommended, but she declined. Therefore, she was administered best supportive therapy. She was discharged 19 days after her admission, after which she visited our institution regularly. However, she was transferred by ambulance because of dyspnea, and she died of hypoxemia due to interstitial pneumonia exacerbation two months after diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Colony-stimulating factor (CSF) is one that promotes colony formation by leukocytes and other cells. G-CSF promotes granulocyte colony formation and is produced by macrophages, fibroblastic cells, and vascular endothelial cell. G-CSF also modulates differentiation and proliferation of granulocytes. In healthy individuals, G-CSF is present at very low levels in the blood circulation, and there is no correlation between circadian changes in serum G-CSF levels or leukocyte and granulocyte counts.\n\n【18】Lung cancer is known to be accompanied paraneoplastic syndromes such as leucocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In 1966, Bardley and Metcalf 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> confirmed the concept of CSF as a humoral factor that promoted the proliferation of bone marrow stem cells. Robinson 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> provided evidence of CSF in the urine and serum of patients with malignant tumors. G-CSF is a cytokine associated with granulocytosis. In lung cancer with leukocytosis, tumor cells presumably produce G-CSF.\n\n【19】In 1977, Asano et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> reported that tumor cells could produce G-CSF and these tumors were designated as G-CSF-producing tumors. G-CSF-producing tumors are diagnosed when 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> there is marked leukocytosis without any other known cause, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> there is elevated serum G-CSF level, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> there is a decline in white blood cell counts after tumor resection, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> there is evidence of G-CSF production in tumor tissues.\n\n【20】In the past, evidence of G-CSF production in tumor tissues required methods showing in vitro colony formation, measuring G-CSF levels after transplanting tumor cells into nude mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, or detecting G-CSF mRNA in tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>; therefore, their clinical application was quite complex. However, with improvements in enzyme immunoassay methods, it has become possible to measure serum G-CSF levels. Moreover, with improvements in anti-G-CSF monoclonal antibodies, it has become possible to provide evidence for G-CSF localization in tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry methods.\n\n【21】Takahashi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> reported that, for the diagnosis of G-CSF-producing tumors, the confirmation of increased serum G-CSF levels and positive immunostaining with an anti-G-CSF antibody were sufficient. Among patients with G-CSF-producing tumors, some may present with fever or have elevated C-reactive protein levels because of other cause of leukocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. G-CSF itself has no effect for causing fever or increasing C-reactive protein levels; therefore, the presence of inflammatory cytokines other than G-CSF is suggested. IL-6 is a promoter of G-CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, and IL-6 produced by tumors can cause not only G-CSF production but also fever and elevated C-reactive protein levels.\n\n【22】Currently, there is no clear definition for IL-6-producing tumors. Fujino et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> provided evidence for production of IL-6 by measuring IL-6 levels produced by cultured tumor cells. In our case, in addition to the elevated serum IL-6 level, the confirmation of IL-6 in tumor cells from a biopsy specimen by immunostaining may have provided evidence for IL-6 production by tumor cells. Our case is significant because IL-6 production was demonstrated by pathological examinations.\n\n【23】Histologically, G-CSF-producing lung cancer comprises giant cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, G-CSF-producing lung cancer has poor prognosis with low-grade tumors and has the potential to invade into vessels and metastasize to lymph nodes. Even in resected cases, two-year mortality is as high as 15% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Prognosis of G-CSF-producing tumors is poor, mortality over one year is as high as 12%, and the mean survival time is five months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. It is unclear if the reason for poor prognosis is the high malignancy potential of G-CSF-producing tumors or the G-CSF itself produced by tumors.\n\n【25】Many G-CSF-producing tumors are suggested to be biologically highly malignant, poorly differentiated, and highly invasive to local lesions and vessels for the following reasons: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> autocrine tumor growth because of the emergence of G-CSF receptors on tumor cells, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> promotion of tumor growth and spread by proliferating neutrophils because of G-CSF, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the inhibition of cellular immunity mediated by macrophages or natural killer cells by G-CSF. These mechanisms are presumably associated with tumor growth and spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Tumors that secrete autocrine growth factors show rapid progression. Moreover, the spread of tumor cells is closely associated with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is a known growth factor for macrophages and granulocytes. G-CSF-producing tumors probably produce cytokines other than G-CSF; thus, establishing a method to measure several cytokines simultaneously is desirable.\n\n【27】G-CSF- and IL-6-producing lung cancer is comparatively rare because we could find only 5 reports concerning G-CSF- and IL-6-producing lung cancer in PubMed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–21\\]</u>. If the serum G-CSF and IL-6 level are measured commonly in lung cancer presenting with elevated white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein level, the more G-CSF and IL-6-producing lung cancer could be found.\n\n【28】When leukocytosis without evidence of infection is found in solid cancer including lung cancer, the serum G-CSF-level should be measured to examine whether tumor cells secrete G-CSF. When G-CSF-producing tumor is diagnosed, the administration of antibiotics is unnecessary. If tumor can be resected, surgical treatment should be considered.\n\n【29】Inoue et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> reported a case of G-CSF- and IL-6-producing lung cancer showing elevated G-CSF and IL-6 level in tumor cells; although they showed the expression of G-CSF receptors on the surface of tumor cell, they could not show the expression of IL-6. In their case, although tumor cells secrete IL-6, IL-6 did not affect the proliferation of tumor cells. As in our case, we did not examine the expression of G-CSF receptors and IL-6 receptors; therefore, it is really unknown whether G-CSF and IL-6 are associated with the proliferation of tumor cells.\n\n【30】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】We encountered a case of lung squamous cell carcinoma that produced both G-CSF and IL-6. When encountering patients with malignant tumors who present with elevated white blood counts and C-reactive proteins levels, serum G-CSF and IL-6 measurements and immunostaining tumor cells with anti-G-CSF and anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies should be considered for diagnosis of G-CSF- and IL-6-producing tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】With over 33 million cases and nearly 600,000 deaths in the United States alone, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> COVID-19 remained at the forefront of attention for both public health and clinical medicine throughout much of 2020 and into 2021. Because COVID-19 was an extremely common diagnosis during this period, this illness was often at the top of the differential when patients presented with nonspecific symptoms suggestive of viral illness. Non-COVID-19 diagnoses such as acute HIV (AHI) with similar presentations could have been easily missed.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 26-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) in February of 2021 feeling generally unwell, with 3 days of symptoms including diaphoresis, dizziness, loose stools, and loss of taste sensation. His past medical history included occasional methamphetamine and cocaine use along with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Vital signs included a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/80 mm of mercury, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.\n\n【6】Bloodwork revealed a white blood cell count of 6.6 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/liter with lymphopenia (absolute lymphocytes 0.3 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/liter). The patient’s complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were otherwise normal. Initial evaluation for pulmonary and gastrointestinal infections included a chest X-ray which demonstrated clear lungs and negative stool polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for Clostridium difficile. A nasopharyngeal PCR swab confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\n【7】The ED physician took a sexual history, noting that the patient had recently ended a relationship with a female partner and had several condomless sex partners thereafter. The patient was screened for HIV in the ED, with results as presented in Table 1. He was discharged with these results still pending. A laboratory-based 4<sup>th</sup>\\-generation HIV antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) test was reactive, while HIV differentiation testing was negative. Outpatient HIV testing was repeated two days later, this time including an HIV RNA. The patient was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) while awaiting his repeat test results. Again, the 4<sup>th</sup>\\-generation Ag/Ab test was reactive, and the differentiation test was negative. HIV RNA was detectable at nearly 1 million copies/ml. A diagnosis of AHI was confirmed and disclosed to the patient, who continued ART and immediately established HIV care.\n\n【8】Table 1 HIV test results in a case of concurrent acute HIV and COVID-19.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】This case of a young man with concurrent COVID-19 and AHI (defined as the initial weeks after HIV infection, prior to antibody formation) illustrates several important points regarding the presentation and diagnosis of AHI, especially during a global public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【11】First, likely due in part to COVID-19-related disruptions in routine clinical services, screening for HIV declined dramatically during the COVID-19 era. Compared with the same period in 2019, following implementation of stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders throughout much of the country, there were nearly 700,000 fewer screening HIV Ag/Ab tests sent and almost 5,000 fewer new HIV-1 diagnoses confirmed at a large U.S. commercial laboratory from March–September 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all people aged 13–64 be screened for HIV at least once (and that people with risk factors be screened at least annually), these recommendations were likely deferred throughout much of 2020-2021. At the same time, HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use and uptake declined, with modeling studies estimating a 21% decrease in PrEP prescriptions and a 28% decrease in new PrEP users in March–September of 2020 compared with the prior year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Screening for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) similarly decreased during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Nationally reported cases of gonorrhea (GC), chlamydia (CT), and primary/secondary syphilis declined steeply in March 2020, despite having risen steadily over the last ten years, resulting in over 27,000 fewer reported GC cases than would have otherwise been expected in April of the same year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. U.S. cities and states demonstrated similar findings: the state of California, for example, reported 31%, 15%, and 13% fewer cases of CT, primary and secondary syphilis, and GC in January–June 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【13】These declines in HIV/STI diagnoses were unlikely to have been driven exclusively by COVID-19-related changes in sexual behavior. While some patients may have changed their sexual practices in response to social distancing requirements, many likely did not, especially as COVID-19 continued into a second year. A review incorporating 20 articles from 12 countries confirmed that many people (25–60%) did not reduce their numbers of sexual partners during the COVID-19 era 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In at least one U.S. survey of men who have sex with men, respondents instead reported mean increases of 2.1 anal sex partners 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】For these reasons, many patients remained vulnerable to STIs/HIV but were less likely to be screened in routine clinical settings at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowing that patients may have missed routine HIV screening, it is imperative for clinicians to consider HIV in their differential diagnoses for viral syndromes, particularly since, as in the case of our patient, there can be a significant symptom overlap between AHI and other viral processes. Indeed, many of the classic COVID-19 signs/symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, including fever, myalgias/arthralgias, pharyngitis, and even gastrointestinal symptoms, are nonspecific and can also be seen in AHI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In terms of laboratory abnormalities, lymphopenia may similarly be observed in both conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Our patient’s AHI diagnosis could have easily been missed had his symptoms been ascribed exclusively to COVID-19 and HIV screening not been sent. Without a confirmed AHI diagnosis, the patient would have been unable to rapidly start ART, an approach known to decrease the risk of forward transmission while reducing loss-to-follow up, improving virologic suppression rates, and potentially decreasing mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Providers should resume screening for HIV and other STIs as an essential service and should consider AHI when evaluating patients like ours with acute viral syndromes. We were fortunate that a sexual history was taken and that HIV screening was initiated when our patient first presented to the ED. Such steps could easily have been deferred, particularly in a busy clinical setting and with an already-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The benefits of sending workup for HIV alongside COVID-19 were similarly demonstrated in Chicago, where a 2020 initiative incorporating routine HIV screening for all patients undergoing COVID-19 evaluations resulted in 9 diagnoses of AHI, including one other case of AHI/COVID-19 coinfection, the details of which have not been previously described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In addition to remaining vigilant to AHI as an alternative or concurrent explanation for nonspecific viral-like symptoms, providers should consider AHI as a possibility when interpreting discordant HIV test results rather than assuming such results represent false positives. After initial HIV exposure, HIV RNA becomes detectable first (often within days of infection), followed by the p24 antigen (detectable within 2-3 weeks after exposure) and finally HIV-1 and 2 antibodies (detectable another week or more thereafter). In routine clinical settings, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> screening for HIV with a laboratory-based HIV Ag/Ab combination immunoassay, capable of detecting the p24 antigen as well as HIV-1 and 2 antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. If the laboratory-based HIV Ag/Ab test is reactive, as was the case with our patient, the second recommended step in workup is a separate immunoassay differentiating antibodies to either HIV-1 or HIV-2. In cases where the differentiation assay is positive for such antibodies, a diagnosis of HIV is confirmed. However, if the differentiation is indeterminate or negative, as was seen with our AHI patient (who presumably had a detectable p24 antigen but had not yet formed HIV antibodies), an HIV RNA is required as the final diagnostic step 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In line with this recommended HIV testing algorithm , our patient had repeat HIV testing, including an HIV RNA, performed within two days of his initial discordant HIV test results. This process allowed for rapid confirmation of the AHI diagnosis and linkage to HIV care. Such favorable outcomes would not have been possible had this patient not been (A) initially screened for HIV/AHI alongside COVID-19 and (B) rapidly retested with an HIV RNA in response to his initial HIV test results. While viral load testing is rarely used as a screening tool due to cost and turnaround time, providers should consider sending an HIV RNA alongside initial Ag/Ab testing in cases where there is a high suspicion for AHI based on symptoms or exposures, as the former test can be necessary to clinch an AHI diagnosis.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Recommended HIV screening algorithm in routine clinical settings. <sup>∗</sup>HIV viral load testing still indicated if high clinical concern for acute HIV and/or in high incidence patient populations, as this is the first test to become positive after HIV acquisition.</u>\n\n【19】To our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of a case of concurrent AHI and COVID-19.

Case Report\n\n【5】The case was a 49-year-old man presenting to the emergency department for a vegetative inguinoscrotal lesion increasing in size for 1 year. On clinical examination, the lesion was purulent, painless, with well-defined irregular contours, and a warty surface, resembling a cauliflower, measuring 6 × 5 mm on the left and 4 × 3 cm on the right .

Extemporaneous examination of inguinal lymphadenopathies confirmed their metastatic nature, followed by the inguinal lymph node dissection. The surgical wound was closed with a scrotal flap.

At a follow-up 18 months later, the clinical examination was quite normal, and there was no tumor recurrence.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Scrotal verrucous carcinoma is a rare entity, first described by Ackerman in 1948 as a variant of squamous cell carcinoma, characterized by exophytic growth without infiltration of the basal membrane with a locally invasive but rarely metastatic development, especially in lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Human papillomaviruses (HPV) types 6 and 11 would have a significant role in the pathogenesis of verrucous carcinoma. However, some studies have not found an association between these tumors and HPV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Clinically, the tumor has a budding, cauliflower appearance, sometimes associated with a superficial, foul-smelling ulceration.\n\n【16】The relationship between Buschke–Lowenstein tumor or giant acuminate condyloma and verrucous carcinoma remains unclear. Some authors consider them two progressive forms of the same disease, while others as separate diseases. Whatever the relationship between these two conditions, their treatment is identical, primarily requiring surgery. Verrucous carcinoma is not related to HPV infection. It is locally aggressive, with possible metastatic potential, and therefore has a poor prognosis. Lowenstein tumor has a low rate of recurrence which carries a good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The biopsy with anatomopathological study confirms the diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma, showing hyperplasia with hyperacanthosis, papillomatosis, and sometimes hyperkeratosis surface. Epithelial buds push back the underlying chorion, respecting the basement membrane. Imaging provides a local extension in order to guide the surgical procedure.\n\n【18】Ultrasound shows the tumor extension to the spermatic cord, epididymis, testicles, and penis. The lesion can be iso- or hypoechoic, well defined, with irregular contours, vascularized at color Doppler.\n\n【19】Magnetic resonance imaging is more sensitive for evaluating the locoregional extension of the tumor and for looking for lymphadenopathy. Scrotal verrucous carcinoma is hypointense on T1 WS, with intermediate signal intensity on T2 WS, with contrast enhancement and restricted diffusion.\n\n【20】Surgical excision with lymph node dissection (in case of associated metastatic lymph nodes) is the standard treatment; it must be wide enough to have negative resection margins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The prognosis is relatively good, but local recurrences are frequent. This justifies clinical monitoring every 4 months during the first year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then every year with a clinical examination supplemented by ultrasound, fine needle aspiration, and screening smear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】Scrotal verrucous carcinoma is a rare mucosal skin disorder. The clinical appearance of the tumor is suggestive, but the positive diagnosis is based on a biopsy with histological study. Imaging is important for local and regional tumor extension. The treatment is based on surgical excision, which must be radical because of the course of frequent recurrences.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This case has two peculiarities. First the pancreatic metastasis was treated just with medical therapy, that is, Sunitinib, instead of the surgical therapy that is mostly considered. Secondly, the pancreatic lesion showed different characteristics on the computed tomography scan compared to the usual pancreatic metastases from renal clear cell carcinoma. The pancreatic metastasis totally regressed after medical treatment and nowadays, four years after the diagnosis, the patient is disease-free.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】The patient, a 75-year-old female, had a positive oncological anamnesis: her brother was affected by rectal neoplasm and her three aunts were affected by breast cancer, bladder cancer, and rectal cancer, respectively. The patient was under medical treatment for hypertension and due to the onset of general malaise, anemia, and asthenia, she performed a total body contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan. CECT total body scan was performed with a triphasic study of the abdomen and with a urographic phase. The scans showed the presence of an expansive solid growing mass with multilobulated shapes on the left kidney. The lesion was 90 mm (Longitudinal Diameter-LD) × 85 mm (Transversal Diameter-TD) × 96 mm (Anteroposterior Diameter-APD) sized 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a), and 1(b))</u>. The mass infiltrated the renal pelvis and the mid calyx 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>; proximal ureter was encased but not infiltrated 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(d))</u>. The mass showed an inhomogeneous enhancement after contrast medium administration due to the presence of solid parts; many colliquative-necrtotic areas and intralesional calcifications were also found 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>. An enlargement of the ipsilateral splenic vein, 9 mm sized 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>, and many intralesional collateral vessels were also observed 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u>. No radiological signs of thrombosis of the main arteries or veins were detected. At the istm of the pancreas a nodular round-shaped lesion, 6 mm in size, was observed. The lesion, isodense in the precontrast scans 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>, after contrast medium administration, appeared hypervascularized in all the three phases of the study with a rich vascular supply 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), and 3(e))</u> and was referable, due to its contrastographic behavior, to a local metastasis or to a primitive neuroendocrine tumor. The pancreatic lesion showed on CECT scan unusual characteristics for a metastasis from renal clear cell carcinoma and, before considering surgical excision of the pancreatic mass, we decided that biopsy of the pancreatic lesion was needed in order to assess its nature. So the patient underwent a left nephrectomy with surrenalectomy and at the same time biopsy of the pancreatic lesion was performed. At the histological examination the renal mass resulted to be a clear cell carcinoma and the pancreatic lesion was found to be a metastasis of clear cell renal carcinoma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) and (b) show the presence of the renal lesion with multilobulated shapes, in the left kidney, 90 mm (LD) × 85 mm (TD) × 96 mm (APD) in size.

So, the patient started medical treatment with Sunitinib, 50 mg/day for two cycles. Due to the onset of grade III skin toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity, the dose of Sunitinib was reduced to 37.5 mg/day for other six cycles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. After three months of treatment another CECT total body scan was performed.

The hypervascularized pancreatic lesion was not more observed; a hypodense round-shaped lesion in the same region was observed 删除1:<u>(Figures 4(c) and 4(d))</u> which was a colliquative-necrotic outcome of the therapy. Considering that the lung lesion appeared during treatment with Sunitinib we thought that the best therapeutic choice was to remove surgically the lung lesion, mainly for two reasons. The first reason was that the patient was in good general clinical condition with adequate lung function and the lesion was surgically resectable. So, according to guidelines, surgery was indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The second reason was that the lung lesion appeared during treatment with Sunitinib, while the pancreatic metastases disappeared, so there was a possibility that the lung lesion was a second malignancy. In our case we decide to surgically remove the lung lesion in order to cure the patient and also because a histological characterization of the lung lesion was needed in order to differentiate the lung lesion from a second malignancy. Therefore, the patient performed surgical removal of the lung lesion. Histological examination deposed for metastasis from clear cell renal carcinoma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Images show the presence of the nodular lesion in the posterior basal segment of the inferior right lobe ((a) and (b)) and the pancreatic lesion after the treatment appeared hypodense due to necrotic-colliquative phenomena ((c) and (d)).

Discussion\n\n【14】The presence of pancreatic metastases from solid tumours is a rare event, with an incidence rate varying from 1.6% to 11% in autopsy series of patients affected by advanced neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The neoplasms that could give this type of metastases are melanoma, lung tumours, colic neoplasms, breast cancer, and with a higher rate of frequency kidney tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Metastasization to the pancreas is most likely due to haematogenous spreading and the site of the tumour, right or left kidney, is an independent prognostic factor of metastasization. This occurs, as described in the analysis of Sellner et al. for the high affinity of the renal cancer cells for the parenchyma of the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In a review of the literature performed by Sellner et al. diagnosis in only 35% of the cases was made in asymptomatic patients. In the remaining 65% of cases, the patients had various symptoms including the following: abdominal pain (20%), gastrointestinal bleeding due to infiltration of the duodenum (20%), obstructive jaundice (9%), weight loss (9%), pancreatitis, and diabetes (3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In many cases the metastases were metachronous with appearance 2–18 years after the diagnosis of the primary tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The treatment of the metastases is usually surgical, with good results in terms of overall survival (about 43 months) and disease-free survival (23.6 months), while the 5-year survival after surgery is between 43% and 88% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. Usually metastases from clear cell renal carcinoma on CT scan are isoattenuating in the unenhanced phase, as observed in our case. After contrast medium administration pancreatic metastases from renal clear cell carcinoma usually closely resemble the appearance of the primary carcinoma, showing on CECT scan irregular and not well-rounded shapes, a nonhomogenous and irregular contrast enhancement, and a central hypoenhancing necrotic portion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. Despite these general features, in our case the pancreatic metastasis on CECT scan showed well-rounded shapes and a homogenous and uniform contrast enhancement without any hypoenhnacing necrotic portion. According to the literature and to our daily radiological experience small hypervascular lesions, with rounded shapes and with a rich and uniform contrast enhancement, as observed in our case, rarely could be referred to metastases from renal clear cell carcinoma. Most often small pancreatic lesions, with rounded shapes and with a uniform contrast enhancement on CECT scan, could be referred to neuroendocrine pancreatic tumours, primitive or metastatic to the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. For these reasons the pancreatic lesion observed in our case presented, on CECT scan, unusual characteristics for a metastasis from renal clear cell carcinoma and this is why the biopsy of the lesion was performed.\n\n【15】In our case the diagnosis of the pancreatic metastasis is synchronous to the primary tumour, unlike the majority of the cases reported in the literature, where the metastases appeared many years after the diagnosis of the primary tumour. In our case the symptomatology was very mild and nonspecific, not clearly indicative of the presence of a pancreatic lesion. Although the guidelines indicate the need for a complete local excision, in our case the patient, who had just performed ​​a major abdominal surgery with nephrectomy, was not in suitable clinical conditions to undergo a second surgical procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Thus, the type of treatment we have chosen was pharmacological, using Sunitinib an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase receptor. Regarding the pulmonary mass, because it appeared during the treatment with Sunitinib, we had thought it was probably a selection of a clone of resistant cells or a second malignancy, so, considering that the patient at that time was in a good clinical condition to perform another surgery, the best therapeutic choice was the surgical resection in order to make a correct differential diagnosis and to obtain a complete eradication of the lung lesion. The management of lung metastases while on Sunitinib treatment must be assessed individually. The target is to reach the complete eradication of the disease with a multimodal approach. Unfortunately, currently there are no randomized trials designed to gain information about the correct timing of treatment strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The data reported in the literature show that metastasectomy after initial systemic therapy gave partial or complete response in a majority of patients. In these patients the median survival was 4.7 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In patients with a single resected pulmonary metastasis a 5 year-overall survival of 50% has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Moreover, it must be considered that there is a difference if the lung metastasis is already present before starting treatment with Sunitinib or if it appears during therapy. In the second case a II line pharmacological treatment is indicated, if metastasectomy is not possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Regarding the choice to continue or discontinue the systemic treatment after achieving a complete response, in the literature there are some studies on few patients, so the results are not yet conclusive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. It has been suggested that, after complete response, there may still be residual cancer cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Some articles published in literature affirm that the discontinuation of chemotherapy may allow the cells to proliferate and lead to disease recurrence, whereas continuation of chemotherapy maintains therapeutic pressure on the residual cancer cells, preventing disease recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Based on these data we continued treatment after achieving a complete response but, due to poor tolerance of the patient, we had to stop the treatment.\n\n【16】However our patient, 47 months after the diagnosis and 20 months after the end of the therapy, is in good condition and disease-free. It is important to remember that patients with pancreatic metastases from renal cancer could be symptomatic but also asymptomatic. Considering that renal clear carcinoma could give metastases even after many years the remission of the disease, a long time follow-up with periodic radiological exams should be performed in patients who had a renal clear carcinoma. Even if the treatment for pancreatic metastasis from renal clear carcinoma is surgical, also the medical therapy for the metastatic lesions could be considered and each case must be assessed individually.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We present a 71-year-old woman presenting with dyspnea on admission. Echocardiogram revealed diastolic heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern concerning for an infiltrative process. She was discharged with diuretic therapy and scheduled for a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. One week after discharge, she was readmitted with progressive shortness of breath and syncope. She was found to be in shock and had multiple episodes of cardiac arrest with both ventricular tachycardia and pulseless electrical activity. She developed electrical storm and eventually passed within 24 hours. Autopsy revealed gross cardiomegaly and left ventricular hypertrophy with Congo red staining revealing amyloid fibrils with apple-green birefringence. This case demonstrates the rapid progression of cardiac amyloidosis from acute-onset diastolic heart failure to uncontrollable ventricular tachycardia, and eventually death. We review the literature regarding multiple diagnostic modalities that facilitate the confirmation of cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Amyloidosis is the extracellular tissue deposition of amyloid fibrils consisting of low molecular weight subunit proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Cardiac amyloidosis is considered an infiltrative cardiomyopathy associated with an unfavorable prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The two major types of cardiac amyloidosis include acquired monoclonal immunoglobin light chain (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR). ATTR also has two different forms between acquired type (ATTRm) and inherited type (ATTRwt). The pathophysiology involves normal protein transforming into an amyloid state, due to cleavage, denaturation, or excess production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Eventually, these proteins form in an antiparallel beta-pleated sheet configuration, becoming amyloid fibrils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. Two-thirds of AL cardiac amyloidosis patients meet Mayo stage III disease on diagnosis with the basis of elevated N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin-I. These elevated markers are associated with death within the first few months of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, clinical outcome often depends on the type of amyloid fibril deposits and how much tissue is involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. We discuss a difficult case highlighting the importance of diagnostic modalities for cardiac amyloidosis that quickly progressed from acute heart failure to electrical storm.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 71-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage 1A right invasive ductal carcinoma pT1cPN0M0, and melanoma (diagnosed in 2000 status after left midback excision) had presented to the emergency department with 2 weeks of worsening dyspnea on exertion. On exam, she had jugular venous distension (JVD) and bilateral leg edema with labs remarkable for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1714 pg/mL (normal <100 pg/mL), D-dimer 2295 ng/mL (normal <500 ng/mL), and elevated troponin of 0.21 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL).\n\n【6】Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block, low voltage, old infarct with Q waves in anteroseptal leads, and T-wave inversions in anterolateral leads . Echocardiogram revealed grade III restrictive diastolic filling pattern suggestive of increased left atrial pressure, preserved ejection fracture (60–65%), dilated inferior vena cava with <50% respiratory variation, and severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy concerning for infiltrative process per strain pattern . Interventricular septum was 1.5 cm (normal: 0.7–1.1 cm), and posterior wall thickness was 1.4 cm (normal: 0.7–1.1 cm). The wall motion was normal with no suggestion for prior focal myocardial infarction. She also had a serum calcium >11 mg/dL (normal <8.6 mg/dL), with an elevated globulin gap (4.3 g/dL on admission), and serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgG lambda monoclonal peak (2683 mg/dL) (normal: <1600 mg/mL) with an abnormal kappa/lambda light chain ratio with kappa of 5.37 mg/dL (normal: <1.96 mg/dL) and lambda of 6535 mg/dL (normal: <1.96 mg/dL) concerning for plasma cell dyscrasia.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Electrocardiogram on admission showing sinus rhythm with low voltage, prior infarct of anteroseptal regions, and T-wave inversions in lateral leads.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Echocardiography shows low global longitudinal cardiac strain (−13.4%) with “cherry on top” pattern (normal value for global longitudinal strain is −20% and below in healthy individuals). Strain pattern is suggestive of possible cardiac amyloidosis.</u>\n\n【9】She later received a bone marrow biopsy which revealed 60% cellular marrow with 40% plasma cells consistent with plasma cell myeloma, but further staining was not performed. A skeletal survey also revealed lytic lesions in bilateral humeri and femurs. She was treated with diuretics on her initial admission, and the patient sought early discharge from the hospital. She was discharged with a diuretic for management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction with recommendations for a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and close follow-up with cardiology and oncology.\n\n【10】One week after discharge, she was readmitted with progressive shortness of breath, fevers, syncope, as well as a clinical presentation consistent with early cholecystitis. Laboratory studies revealed WBC >21 × 10<sup>9</sup>/dL (normal: <9.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>/dL), acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL (normal: <1.1 × mg/dL), shock liver with aspartate aminotransferase 495 U/L (normal: <40 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase 494 U/L (normal: <40 U/L), BNP of 4687 pg/mL (normal: <100 pg/mL), troponin of 2.82 ng/mL (normal: <0.04 ng/mL), and potassium of 4.6 mEq/L (normal: 3.5–5.2 mEq/L). Abdominal computed tomography scan revealed new abdominal ascites and small gallbladder stones with pericholecystic stranding and duodenal thickening. On the day after admission, she developed unstable ventricular tachycardia but spontaneously converted after two minutes to junctional bradycardia . Telemetry strips were not saved from the event. Given concern for marked sinus bradycardia and corrected QT interval of 509 ms (normal <440 ms), R-on-T phenomena was suspected as a possible cause for the patient’s polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Intravenous isoproterenol was started, and advanced cardiac life support protocol was initiated. After 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), patient awoke but was unable to maintain saturation, and she was promptly intubated. Subsequent defibrillation converted the ventricular tachycardia to a sinus rhythm with a rate of 50–60 beats per minute. There was a concern for recurrent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Immediate left heart catherization revealed nonobstructive coronary artery disease. Right heart catherization showed an elevated mean right atrial pressure of 30 mmHg, right ventricular pressure of 62/17 mmHg, mean pulmonary artery pressure of 51 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 40 mmHg, cardiac index of 1.8 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, cardiac output of 3.2 L/min, and systemic vascular resistance of 920 dynes/seconds/cm<sup>5</sup>. A transvenous pacer wire was placed to assist against further ventricular tachycardia episodes. She appeared to have a mixed picture of distributive and cardiogenic shock. She remained hypotensive and in shock despite maximized dosing for norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. The patient decompensated again with unstable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Rhythm control agents with the use of amiodarone and overdrive pacing were futile. The ventricular tachycardia persisted despite several rounds of CPR, defibrillation, epinephrine, amiodarone, and bicarbonate. The patient’s family came to the bedside and requested resuscitation efforts be terminated. They authorized the autopsy which subsequently revealed gross cardiomegaly and left ventricular hypertrophy . Congo red staining of both ventricular and hepatic tissue revealed amyloid fibrils with apple-green birefringence .

Discussion\n\n【15】The patient had an unusual presentation of symptoms with rapid progression of heart failure and tachyarrhythmia. Her two hospitalizations were one week apart. While she was scheduled for outpatient workup for her plasma cell dyscrasia, this was unable to be completed due to her rapid progression and subsequent readmission. She developed cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias that were nonresponsive to conventional therapies. Early recognition and diagnosis and treatment are vital for patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【16】Among the different types of amyloidosis, primary AL and both secondary amyloidosis ATTRm and ATTRwt can commonly involve the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. Manifestations of cardiac amyloidosis include heart failure and heart block 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Infiltration of amyloid fibrils in the ventricles results in stiffening progressing to restrictive cardiomyopathy causing diastolic dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 7, 8\\]</u>. Cytotoxic effects of amyloid fibrils lead to apoptosis and fibrosis with eventual systolic dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 9\\]</u>. The classic symptoms of heart failure manifest with exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia with 10–20% incidence in all cases of cardiac amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Other common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> conduction abnormalities include ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Physical examination findings include those of heart failure including JVD, lower extremity edema, and an S3 gallop 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Extracardiac manifestations include purpura, macroglossia, periorbital edema, nephrotic syndrome, hepatomegaly, ascites, and bilateral carpal syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【17】There are various cardiac diagnostic modalities that facilitate the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. A brief review of literature is presented as follows.\n\n【18】Electrocardiogram: cardiac amyloidosis manifests as pseudoinfarction pattern with low voltage in limb leads (<5 mm) and poor R-wave progression and precordial leads 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In AL, 50% have low voltage in frontal and precordial leads, whereas in ATTR, only 30% meet low voltage criteria (low voltage may be confined to frontal leads only) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Cyrille et al. explains that the sum of amplitudes of S wave in V1 and R wave in V5 or V6 more than 3.5 mV is considered a measure of left ventricular hypertrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and less than 1.5 mV is associated with dismal outcomes in all cardiac amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 15\\]</u>. Absence of left ventricular hypertrophy does not exclude cardiac amyloidosis as only 10–20% will meet left ventricular hypertrophy criteria, while up to 50% will have pseudoinfarction pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14–16\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Echocardiogram: echocardiographic findings include biatrial enlargement, ventricular wall and valvular thickening, diastolic dysfunction, and classic granular sparkling appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Doppler measurements include the assessment of ratio (E/A) of early (E) and late (A) diastolic peak velocities along with deceleration time (time taken by peak E velocity to return to baseline) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Assessment of strain and strain rate (longitudinal axis dysfunction) can help diagnose cardiac amyloidosis earlier in subclinical stages and gauge survival outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The development of speckle-tracking echocardiography better analyzes the longitudinal axis, particularly radial and circumferential strain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The significant decrease of longitudinal strain in the mid and basal wall regions with preservation of the apical region has high sensitivity and specificity (ranging from 90%–95% and 80%–85%, respectively) for cardiac amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Diffuse valve thickening, atrial septal thickening, and right ventricular hypertrophy help differentiate cardiac amyloidosis from other causes of left ventricular hypertrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. ATTR is common in aortic stenosis and can be seen in up to 15% of elderly patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The “cherry on top” strain pattern was found in our patient on the prior admission , but further workup was warranted for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【20】Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: cardiac magnetic resonance imaging employs various techniques including strain analysis and tissue imaging with and without contrast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can assess strain with a technique known as displacement encoding with stimulated echoes with high sensitivity and specificity rivaling echocardiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Myocardial injury secondary to amyloid deposition in the interstitium serves as a reservoir for gadolinium accumulation resulting in characteristic late gadolinium enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. This technique has a sensitivity of close to 80% and specificity of 94% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Late gadolinium enhancement when coupled with phase-sensitive inversion recovery has shown to provide a better assessment of the extent of cardiac involvement allowing Fontana 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> to classify patients with AL and ATTR in 3 subcategories (normal, subendocardium, and transmural) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Transmural is associated with the worst prognosis (5.4-fold increase in mortality) and the progression of normal to subendocardium to transmural late gadolinium was proportionally related to extracellular volume expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Although cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has extreme diagnostic utility, our patient decompensated acutely prior to obtaining this study.\n\n【21】Nuclear imaging: a noninvasive way to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis involves the accumulation of radiotracers, most commonly technetium-99m and 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-DPD) and technetium-99m-pyrophosphate (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-PYP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 25\\]</u>. <sup>99m</sup>Tc-DPD scintigraphy has been useful in the workup for cardiac amyloidosis with high specificity and sensitivity for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis while showing low seismicity and high specificity for AL cardiac amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. In addition to <sup>99m</sup>Tc-DPD and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-PYP, technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-MDP) scintigraphy has also been studied in cardiac amyloidosis workup. All three forms of nuclear testing have shown such high sensitivity and specificity, especially when resulting with high uptake (Grade 2 or Grade 3) that additional endomyocardial biopsy would not be necessary for the diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Despite these imaging modalities, endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard given the ability to use microscopy and histopathology and directly observes the deposition of amyloid fibrils as amorphous deposits 通用删除1(英):<u>(as seen in our patient, Figure 5)</u>. Endomyocardial biopsy is a relatively safe procedure with almost 100% sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. However, our latent pathological diagnosis was from tissue obtained by autopsy.\n\n【22】The treatment modalities of cardiac amyloidosis are mainly aimed at managing clinical heart failure but specifically managing amyloidosis may involve chemotherapy and various transplant modalities including hematopoietic stem cell, heart, and liver transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8, 29\\]</u>. The role of heart transplant is still under investigation. Younger patients <60 years without associated plasma cell dyscrasia or other major organ involvement are better candidates for orthotopic heart transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】Cardiac amyloidosis is a life-threatening manifestation of systemic amyloidosis. Patients with exertional dyspnea, low voltage electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram with left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction are concerning for cardiac amyloidosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and phase-sensitive inversion recovery was initially ordered as the next step in our workup of cardiac amyloidosis. While supportive therapy for heart failure, chemotherapy and transplant are the currently available modalities for treatment, and the prognosis of cardiac amyloidosis depends upon the extent of myocardial involvement with amyloid. In addition, previously undiagnosed, advance-stage multiple myeloma was likely the precursor of our patient’s cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【25】Unfortunately, our patient progressed rapidly from heart failure to ventricular storm, thus underlining the importance of expediting advanced imaging diagnostics that may have facilitated expedient management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Presence of a factor-V Leiden mutation in a patient with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) has been reported only once. Here we report the second DM1 patient carrying a factor-V mutation who died from long-term complications of this mutation. Case Report. A 66-year-old DM1 patient with multi-organ-disorder syndrome developed a first deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and consecutive pulmonary embolism (PE) at age 50 y. Acetyl-salicylic acid was given. One year later he experienced a second DVT; that is why phenprocoumon was started. Despite anticoagulation, he experienced a third DVT bilaterally and a second PE bilaterally at 61 y; that is why a vena cava filter was additionally deployed. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation, he experienced a vena cava filter thrombosis at age 62 y. Genetic workup revealed a heterozygous factor-V mutation in addition to a CTG-repeat expansion of 500. As a consequence of PE he developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and experienced recurrent pulmonary infections, which were lastly responsible for decease at age 66 y despite intensive care measures. Conclusion. The heterozygous Leiden mutation may severely affect DM1 patients to such a degree that they die from its complications. If DM1 patients present with unusual manifestations, search for causes other than a CTG-repeat expansion is indicated.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Double genetic troubles are rare or underdiagnosed and have been only rarely reported in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (dystrophia myotonica (DM1)) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Here we present a DM1 patient with heterozygosity for the factor-V (Leiden) mutation, which lastly was responsible for the fatal outcome of this patient.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient is a 66- year-old Caucasian male, with height 176 cm and weight 77 kg, with a history of cholecystectomy at age 24 y, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism since age 26 y (onset of disease), and steatosis hepatis, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia since at least age 42 y . Since age 42 y, mild cognitive impairment developed. Since age 45 y, bilateral ptosis became apparent. Since at least age 49 y, hepatopathy was evident and he developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). At age 50 y, he experienced a first spontaneous deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with consecutive pulmonary embolism (PE). Acetyl-salicylic acid was given for secondary prophylaxis because of cognitive impairment. Cerebral CT (CCT) showed leukoencephalopathy and pneumosinus dilatans. At age 51 y, he experienced a second spontaneous DVT. Since then oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon was given. Neurologic exam revealed ptosis exclusively. Diagnostic workup for the cause of recurrent DVT revealed the factor-V Leiden mutation in its heterozygous form . Since age 53 y, weakness of the limb muscles developed. Muscle biopsy from the left brachial biceps muscle at age 54 y revealed only nonspecific alterations with some central nuclei and type-II-fiber predominance. Genetic testing at age 55 y revealed a heterozygous CTG-repeat expansion of 500 repeats in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. Prostate hyperplasia became apparent and a synthetic growth factor was applied for growth retardation and short stature during 1 y, without success. At age 59 y, he experienced pneumonia two times. Thrombocytopenia became apparent . Further downstream writing became increasingly impaired. Echocardiography showed aortic insufficiency grade 1 and mitral insufficiency grade 1. Cerebral MRI revealed marked general atrophy and marked leukoencephalopathy . At age 60 y, he experienced vestibular neuronitis but search for acoustic nerve neurinoma was negative. Clinical neurologic exam at age 60 y revealed myopathic face, bilateral hypoacusis, dysarthria, weak head anteflexion (M5-), diffuse weakness (M5-) of the upper limbs, cogwheel rigidity bilaterally, bilateral postural tremor, weakness for hip flexion (M5-), weakness for foot extension (M5-), general diffuse wasting, generally reduced tendon reflexes, and recurrent hyper-CKemia . During hospitalisation, ascites from hepatopathy developed. At age 61 y, he experienced a second PE bilaterally with right-sided infarction pneumonia and a third DVT bilaterally. The INR value was outside the therapeutic range at this event. As a consequence, a vena cava filter was implanted. CCT showed atrophy and leukoencephalopathy. Abdominal CT revealed an atrophic pancreas, a left-sided renal cyst, and prostate hyperplasia. At age 62 y, he experienced thrombosis of the vena cava filter under an INR of 3.0. At age 63 y, he underwent cataract surgery bilaterally. At age 64 y, an AV-block I was documented for the first time. At age 65 y, an event recorder was implanted because of suspected arrhythmias. Recurrent interrogations revealed paroxysmal AFIB. The MMSE was 25. Shortly afterwards he was admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe dyspnea caused by pneumonia with an oxygen saturation of 63% and a pH of 6.92 requiring mechanical ventilation. Since hd1 he developed a striking restless-leg syndrome. On hd12 he underwent tracheostomy. On hd47 he received a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). One day later he was transferred to the neurologic rehabilitation unit. Three days later he again required mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure. He died on hd78 because of sepsis from pneumonia. The patient was a nonsmoker and nonalcoholic. His family history was positive for cataract and glaucoma (father), diabetes (brother of mother), and myocardial infarction (mother). He had one healthy son with gamma-globulin deficiency.\n\n【6】Table 1 Blood chemical values.\n\n【7】Table 2 Coagulation parameters.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 MRI of the cerebrum showing diffuse atrophy gliotic spots and leucoaraiosis. Pneumosinus dilatans can be also seen.</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】The presented patient is interesting for several reasons. First, he is only the second patient with a double genetic trouble comprising a CTG-repeat expansion in the DMPK gene and the Leiden mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The first DM1 patient with a Leiden mutation additionally had protein C deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In a further DM1 patient the CTG-repeat expansion was associated with a de novo shortened D4Z4 repeat fragment at the 4q35 locus giving rise to a facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The second point of interest is that he experienced recurrent DVT despite only heterozygous APC resistance. He developed DVT and PE, despite oral anticoagulation and thus required a vena cava filter, and he developed thrombosis of the vena cava filter, despite sufficient anticoagulation. Possibly, the presence of the DMPK mutation enhanced the pathologic effect of the Leiden mutation. It can be speculated that expression of proteins required for the autochthon thrombolysis system was impaired to such a degree that it resulted in a gross prothrombotic effect. It is also possible that the mutated factor-V mRNA was further modified at the posttranslational level by sequestered RNA-binding proteins. It is also conceivable that liver disease favoured the development of DVT, PE, and cava filter thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, history and laboratory investigations were negative for hepatitis, HIV, cholangitis, cholestasis, and storage disease, and abdominal CT did not show liver disease. Secret alcohol consumption was rather unlikely given the absence of red blood cell stigmata. Thus, hepatopathy was most likely attributable to liver involvement in DM1. Though impaired mobility from DM1 has been reported to favour the development of thrombotic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and the patient was lazy, it is rather unlikely that muscle involvement contributed to the etiology of recurrent DVT, since he displayed only mild muscle impairment, also in the leg compartment, and had rather normal mobility.\n\n【12】Third, the patient is interesting for marked central nervous system (CNS) involvement in the disease. He presented not only with dysarthria but also with cognitive decline, extrapyramidal manifestations, cogwheel rigidity, tremor, cerebral atrophy, and leukoencephalopathy, a combination of abnormalities previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–8\\]</u>. Of particular interest are the Parkinson’s features (cogwheel rigidity, impaired writing) in the presented patient since, contrary to DM2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, only few DM1 patients have been reported with manifestations of Parkinson’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Fourth, the patient is interesting for multiorgan disorder syndrome (MODS) affecting the skeletal muscles (ptosis, limb weakness, and weakness of respiratory muscles), the CNS (leukoencephalopathy, cognitive decline, dysarthria, cogwheel rigidity, postural tremor, impaired writing, and cerebral atrophy), the ears (hypoacusis, vestibular neuronitis), the liver (hepatopathy, steatosis, and cholecystolithiasis), the endocrine system (hypogonadism, prostate hyperplasia), the bones (pneumosinus dilatans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>), and the immune system (reduced IgG, reduced IgM, and recurrent pulmonary infections) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Fifth, the patient is the only DM1 patient reported receiving a vena cava filter. Whether this intervention favoured the development of recurrent pulmonary infections remains speculative. A further causative factor of pulmonary infections could be IgG deficiency, frequently found in DM1 patients, or IgM deficiency but also the recurrent PE resulting in COPD could be contributory. Additionally, it is possible that small PE occurred even after anticoagulation and placement of the vena cava filter, favouring recurrent pulmonary infections (infarction pneumonia). It is also conceivable, that PE had been mistaken as pneumonia. Since the patient never complained about dysphagia, microaspiration was rather excluded as the cause of recurrent pulmonary infections.\n\n【15】In conclusion, this case shows that a Leiden mutation, even if present in a heterozygous form, may severely affect DM1 patients to such a degree that they die from its long-term complications. If DM1 patients present with uncommon phenotypic manifestations, search for causes other than a CTG-repeat expansion including other mutations is indicated. Neurologists should be alert to the possibility that individuals having two separate mutations in unrelated genes may develop unusually severe phenotypes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Although management may involve physical therapy, immunomodulatory drugs, and analgesics, there is nothing specific for the treatment of NA. Full functional recovery can take months to years, but recurrence and/or persistence of symptoms and disability are frequent. This case reports a 22-year-old male who recovered from NA within 3 months following treatment with 1000 mg of methylprednisolone and off-label use of 0.5 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for four consecutive days. Three years later, the patient experienced soreness and paresthesia of the shoulder following a military shooting exercise, and 0.75 g/kg of IVIG and 1000 mg of MP were prescribed for 2 consecutive days resulting in complete recovery and no recurrences to date. EMG findings, 3.5-year postinitial treatment, revealed improvement in the brachial plexopathy. This provides support for the combined use of IVIG and glucocorticoids in the treatment of NA and highlights the need for further studies investigating whether this combined treatment regimen may accelerate recovery and improve long-term outcomes for patients diagnosed with NA.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Parsonage–Turner syndrome, also more commonly referred to as neuralgic amyotrophy (NA), inflammatory brachial plexopathy, or idiopathic brachial plexopathy, classically presents as sudden, severe, unilateral, neuropathic pain in the arm or shoulder followed by paresis, muscular atrophy, and sensory loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. The initiation and progression of the disease is suspected to involve a combination of genetic, biomechanical, immunological, and environmental factors but can also be hereditary with an autosomal dominant inheritance or idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 4\\]</u>. Although historically considered a rare disease with estimates of 2-3 cases per 100,000/year in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>, the actual incidence rate is predicted to be much higher at 1 in 1000 patients among the general population when primary care providers received more training in diagnosing this disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Similarly, the Dutch military suspects their current NA incidence rates, 18 cases per 100,000/year to be an underestimation due to lack of training and recognition of this disease by military personnel and physicians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Despite increasing recognition and diagnosis of NA, recovery times are extensive and prognosis remains poor, highlighting the need to report alternative treatments with improved outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Since there is no specific treatment for NA, traditional management involves an expectant, or “wait and see” approach, while more recent studies suggest a high-dose oral corticosteroid early in the disease process and a long-acting opioid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if pain is present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–5, 8, 9\\]</u>. However, with these therapies, many patients remain in pain or have sustained loss of function; less than 10% of patients, in a 246-person cohort, reported a full recovery from NA after 3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Recovery time is also extensive, lasting between 6 and 18 months with recurrence rates at 25% and 75% for idiopathic and hereditary NA, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10\\]</u>. This highlights the need for more effective therapies to attenuate NA symptoms and promote functional recovery. In the following case report, a suspected immune-mediated pathogenesis of NA prompted treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), (Gamunex-C<sup>®</sup>, Research Triangle Park, NC) for its potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, and methylprednisolone acetate (MP) (Depo-Medrol<sup>®</sup>, Kalamazoo, MI). Administering this therapy during the NA acute phase elicited a full functional recovery within 3 months for this patient.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】An otherwise healthy, 22-year-old male Marine presented to the Neurology Department with painless, progressive paresthesia and paresis to his right dominant limb that started 14 days prior. During that time, he was participating in an 8-day training exercise where he hiked nearly 113 km carrying a total load of 54–60 kg. His family history was unremarkable, but his medical history was notable for right acromial numbness and paresthesia without paresis lasting three months with no medical intervention, following a 19 km run with a 20 kg rucksack, eight months prior.\n\n【7】Sixteen hours into his 8-day training exercise, he began experiencing painless, right arm weakness with no improvement when the pack was removed. By day 5, his shoulder and upper arm were paretic. He retained his forearm range of motion, but with notable weakness. On day 7, he was unable to perform fine motor tasks, and by day 9, he had approximately 4 kg of right-hand grip strength.\n\n【8】Initial physical examination revealed no aphasia or dysarthria, facial droop, or apparent higher cortical function deficits. His extraocular muscles were intact, as well as the range of motion of his cervical spine. All physical exam findings of the extremities were compared bilaterally with pertinent exam findings only noted on the patient’s right upper extremity. All other extremities had normal findings.\n\n【9】He had mild winging of the right scapula, some atrophy of the right shoulder girdle, and deltoid but could shrug his shoulder. Right rhomboids and serratus anterior were intact. A few deltoid and triceps fasciculations were observed. Using Medical Research Council (MRC) criteria, motor scores on the patient’s right side were as follows: deltoid 4, supraspinatus 3, pectoralis 4, biceps 4, brachioradialis 4, triceps 3, wrist extensors 2, finger extensors 2, pronator teres 4, finger flexors 4, intrinsic hand movement 4, flexor carpi ulnaris 3-4, and all contralateral muscles of the left upper extremity were 5 . His right upper extremity was areflexic, and his left was 2+. Bilaterally, his patellar reflexes were 2+, ankle jerks were 2+, and toes were downgoing. The patient had lack of sensation to light touch and pinprick from the dorsum of his right shoulder and triceps, distally. Position sense was intact. He had no Romberg’s sign, and his gait and station were normal.\n\n【10】Table 1 Summary of Medical Research Council (MRC) scores of right limb before and after IVIG treatment.\n\n【11】Chest MRI without contrast showed asymmetry of the nerve roots on the right side. Additionally, there was a subtle increase in T2 signal intensity and enlargement in the roots of C7, C8, and T1 in coronal and sagittal exams 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u>. This enlargement extended into the middle, and inferior trunks. Compared to the contralateral side, the right brachial plexus divisions were enlarged with an increased T2 signal intensity.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest MRI of the patient with inflammatory brachial plexopathy. (a) Coronal chest and (b) sagittal chest, T2 weighted and fat-suppressed MRI images without contrast show elevated T2 signaling indicating subtle thickening in the right brachial plexus structure at the time of diagnosis.</u>\n\n【13】An EMG was performed to further determine the extent of injury. Right brachial plexopathy involving primarily the posterior and lateral cords was confirmed by EMG. The deltoid, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, brachioradialis, and extensor digitorum communis in the right arm displayed acute, and to a lesser extent chronic, denervation changes. No electrophysiological evidence for nerve entrapment or radiculopathy was noted in the right upper extremity. These findings provided the basis for diagnosis of inflammatory brachial plexopathy.\n\n【14】The patient was treated for 4 consecutive days with 1000 mg of MP and 0.5 g/kg of IVIG. With this therapy, he experienced transient headaches, abdominal and facial edema, and diaphoresis. After the infusions were completed, he was given 80 mg of oral prednisone and instructions to taper the dosage by 20 mg every 3 days. The patient also received physical therapy for 4 months. Within 3 months, motor function and cutaneous sensations were fully recovered, and he was able to continue his military training.\n\n【15】Two years later, following a shooting exercise, the patient developed shoulder soreness and paresthesia in his right upper extremity. He was prescribed boosters of IVIG 0.75 g/kg and 1000 mg of MP for 2 consecutive days and the same course of oral prednisone. The paresthesia subsided upon completion of the treatment and has not recurred.\n\n【16】Upon posttreatment examination 3.5 years after the initial injury, consistent with initial findings, he had mild winging of the right scapula, and shoulder shrug, rhomboids, and serratus anterior remained intact. He had no Romberg’s sign, and his gait and station were normal. Compared to the initial examination, any atrophy, fasciculations, or deficits in sensation were no longer apparent. Motor scores of the right side were generally improved: deltoid 5, supraspinatus 5, pectoralis 4, biceps 5, brachioradialis 5, triceps 4, wrist extensors 4, finger extensors 4, pronator teres 5, finger flexors 5, intrinsic hand movement 5, and flexor carpi ulnaris 4, and the left upper extremity 5 . His right upper extremity reflex was 1+ (compared to previously being areflexic), and his left upper extremity reflex maintained at 2+. Bilaterally, his patellar reflexes 2+, ankle jerks 2+, and toes were downgoing, indicating no changes from the initial exam.\n\n【17】A follow-up EMG performed 3.5 years postinitial injury showed chronic, but not acute, denervation in muscles innervated by the superior trunk of the right brachial plexus, indicating an improvement in the brachial plexopathy .\n\n【18】Table 2 Summary of EMG findings of right limb before and after IVIG treatment.\n\n【19】Table 3 Nerve conduction findings of right limb.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】Neuralgic amyotrophy is a debilitating disease that can be initiated by genetics, biomechanical factors, immunological factors, or a combination of these factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 12\\]</u>. Septin-9 on chromosome 17q25, a protein responsible for cytoskeleton formation, cellular division, and tumorigenesis, is commonly mutated among those with hereditary NA, an autosomal dominant disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.

Evidence of acute inflammation and axonal loss on his MRI and EMG made him a prospective candidate for this therapy, as there is evidence to support NA as an organ-specific immune-mediated disorder, rather than a generalized autoimmune disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Immune changes seen in patients with NA include blastogenic activity of lymphocytes within the brachial plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 14, 15\\]</u>, presence of antiganglioside antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 16\\]</u>, increased serum antiperipheral nerve myelin antibodies, and soluble terminal complement activation products during the acute phase of NA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Based on these data of prior NA patients, there are several, theorized mechanisms of action of how IVIG may have contributed to the healing process and full functional recovery in this patient. IVIG has regulatory effects on the complement system such as inhibiting active complement components from binding to and initiating destructive inflammatory responses against tissues; IVIG can also neutralize the anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, thereby reducing inflammation in NA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>. IVIG may also accelerate the clearing of pathogenic IgG seen in NA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Other NA case studies treated with IVIG and MP have demonstrated improved outcomes, often with shortened recovery times, compared to expectantor MP management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 16, 21–25\\]</u>. However, it has not been shown to improve the prognosis for every patient. This necessitates further research to better understand the mechanisms of NA and diagnostic indicators warranting this treatment regimen.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】This case report demonstrates the complete functional recovery of a patient suffering from NA following treatment with IVIG and MP within 3 months. These results are noteworthy as full functional recovery is rarely obtained with current recommended therapies, and partial functional recovery may take 6–18 months. The detection of antiganglioside antibodies and other inflammatory mediators prompted clinicians to consider IVIG and MP for the treatment of NA in this case. The efficacy and best time to administer this therapy has yet to be determined, but there are several cases that support the idea that IVIG and MP alleviate the symptoms and often improve the prognosis of NA. Although further research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis of NA and the therapeutic mechanism, efficacy, and potential adverse effects of IVIG in the treatment of NA, these results support a promising additional indication and usage for IVIG.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "189c095e-4dec-4e98-a933-937687c19cfe", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】We presented a case of diffuse-type tenosynovial giant cell tumour (DTSGCT) of foot masquerading as Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Preliminary diagnosis by needle biopsy was difficult due to the major involvement of bones and the overshadowing effect of the accompanying Langerhans cells. The complete curettage specimen with relevant immunohistochemistry and molecular tests made the final diagnosis of DTSGCT possible. The biomolecular mechanism for the masquerading phenomenon was explained by CSF1 overexpression in the neoplastic cells attracting migration and proliferation of CSF1R-positive Langerhans cells.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】An accurate and prompt diagnosis of symptomatic bone tumours requires a multidisciplinary team approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This includes a well-planned biopsy at dedicated medical centre with prior input from the orthopedic surgeon, radiologist, pathologist, and oncologist. Needle biopsy if properly conducted is preferred over open biopsy for minimal wound contamination. However, sampling limitations and mimickers of various bone lesions do pose difficulties in making an accurate diagnosis. We present a case we encountered recently that illustrates such difficulties.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 32-year-old man presented half-a-year ago with pain over his left foot for several months. He noticed swelling over the same site since teenage years with no medical consultation. Physical examination revealed a firm swelling over his left foot lateral aspect. Plain X-ray and CT scan 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u> showed a multilobulated expansile osteolytic lesion in the left cuboid and lateral cuneiform bones. It crossed the tarsal and tarsal-metatarsal joints with early extension to the base of the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> metatarsal, totally measuring 3.0 × 3.5 × 3.5 cm. Cortical scalloping and erosions were seen in these bones as well as focal sclerotic border. MRI demonstrated PD-intermediate and T2-hyperintense signal in the lesion matrix 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(c) and 1(d))</u>. A cortical defect was present at plantar aspect of the cuboid with tumour extrusion into the plantar soft tissue.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18</sup></u>F-FDG PET showed marked hypermetabolism over peripheral aspect of the lesion (SUVmax 16.1). No hypermetabolic nodal or distant metastasis was detected. The radiological features suggested a locally aggressive primary bone tumour.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Plain X-ray of left foot demonstrated an expansile lytic lesion in cuboid and lateral cuneiform. (b) CT scan highlighted its well-defined margin and cortical scalloping of lateral cuneiform (arrowed). (c) MRI showed PD-intermediate signal of the lobulated lesion with distal cortical perforation and (d) hyperintense signal on T2.</u>\n\n【7】Needle biopsy was done and showed tumour tissue characterized by clusters and cords of pinkish epithelioid cells in a fibromyxoid stroma 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. The epithelioid cells have central to eccentric open nuclei with distinct nucleoli. There was no significant nuclear pleomorphism or frank malignancy. A prominent chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate including lymphocytes, foamy macrophages, and histiocytes was noted in the background. No multinucleated giant cells were seen. Initial immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed most cells in the lesion were positive for endothelial markers and histiocytic markers. Differential diagnosis of epithelioid haemangioendothelioma was excluded by the negative IHC for CAMTA1 and TFE3. Further IHC demonstrated numerous CD1a 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a), insert)</u> and Langerin-positive Langerhans cells, while H3.3G34 W and H3K36 M for giant cell tumour of bone and chondroblastoma, respectively, were negative. Thinking along the line of a primary bone tumour, diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis was suggested, but with reservation due to the paucity of eosinophils and the prominent fibromyxoid stroma. Complete curettage of the lesion and cementation was then performed. The curettage specimen showed fragments of fibronodular tumour tissue with patchy necrosis and well-defined borders. There were cords and clusters of pinkish epithelioid cells similar to those seen in the needle biopsy 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Most of these cells were CD1a- and Langerin-positive on IHC 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. In addition, there were prominent pseudoalveolar spaces, focal chondroid metaplasia, aggregates of multinucleated giant cells, and scattered Desmin-positive dendritic cells. These features were compatible with a diffuse-type tenosynovial giant cell tumour (DTSGCT), being supported by IHC for Clusterin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> which stained a minor population of the epithelioid cells 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u> and cells lining the pseudoalveoli. This diagnosis was further confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrating colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) translocation in scattered cells using a break-apart probe 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(e))</u>. The patient remained unremarkable 3 months after surgery and would be monitored for local recurrence.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Needle biopsy of cuboid lesion showed clusters and cords of pinkish epithelioid cells in a fibromyxoid stroma (H&E x40). The insert showed numerous CD1a-positive cells on immunohistochemistry (IHC x40). (b) The curettage specimen showed cellular clusters of pinkish epithelioid cells with open nuclei (H&E x400). (c) Majority of epithelioid cells are Langerin-positive Langerhans cells (IHC x400). (d) Scattered cells are Clusterin-positive tumour cells (IHC x400). (e) FISH showed scattered nuclei with break-apart green and red signals of CSF-1 (arrowed).</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】DTSGCT of soft tissue, whether intraarticular or extraarticular, is often symptomatic and prone to local recurrence if incompletely excised. DTSGCT involving bones of the foot rarely occurs, and some cases have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The present tumour most likely originated from the tarsal synovial joint with secondary bulky involvement of the adjacent tarsal and metatarsal bones. Besides the major intraosseous location, needle biopsy interpretation was compounded by the numerous reactive Langerhans cells, raising the suspicion of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. However, the paucity of eosinophils and the prominent fibromyxoid stroma were features unusual for this diagnosis. The long clinical history offered by the patient, plus focal sclerotic border on plain-X-ray and lack of frank malignancy by microscopy, pointed to a locally aggressive slow-growing tumour. This warranted complete curettage as the surgical treatment of choice. The pathological features of the curettage specimen were classical of diffuse-type tenosynovial giant cell tumour. This diagnosis was supported by IHC for Clusterin confirming the presence of synovial cells and FISH confirming the translocation of CSF1 in tumour cells. AS DTSGCT is prone to local recurrence, follow-up monitoring of this patient was also advised.\n\n【11】On retrospect, the prominent Langerhans cell proliferation could be explained by CSF1 translocation in tumour cells and their subsequent overexpression of CSF1 protein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The latter attracted the migration and proliferation of Langerhans cells together with other dendritic cells which possessed the cell surface protein CSF1R 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This contributed to the “landscaping effect” by macrophages and various dendritic cells so commonly seen in tenosynovial giant cell tumours.\n\n【12】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【13】We would like to raise awareness for the possible major bone involvement by DTSGCT mimicking a primary bone tumour and the exuberant reactive Langerhans cell proliferation mimicking Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Our case is unique with these two features occurring together, thus making diagnosis on the needle biopsy difficult. Although the underlying biomolecular mechanism is now known, the masquerading effect of Langerhans cells in DTSGCT has not been highlighted before in the medical literature and therefore is worth emphasizing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Bilateral reduction mammoplasty is a common plastic surgery procedure that can be complicated by unfavorable scar formation along incision sites. Surgical adhesives can be utilized as an alternative or as an adjunct to conventional suture closures to help achieve good wound tension and provide an adequate barrier with excellent cosmesis. The recently introduced DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System Skin Closure System combines the skin adhesive 2-octyl cyanoacrylate with a self-adhering polyester-based mesh. Proposed benefits of wound closure with DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System, used with or without sutures, include its watertight seal, easy removal, microbial barrier, even distribution of tension, and reduction in wound closure time. Although allergic reactions to 2-octyl cyanoacrylate have been reported, few allergic reactions to DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System have been noted in the literature. This case series describes three patients who experienced an allergic reaction to DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System after undergoing elective bilateral reduction mammoplasties at our institution to further explore this topic. Methods. Retrospective chart review of bilateral reduction mammoplasty patients who received DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System dressing at our institution was performed. Results. Three patients were identified as having a rash in reaction to DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System after bilateral reduction mammoplasty. All three patients required systemic steroid treatment to resolve the rash. One patient was identified as having a prior adhesive reaction. Conclusions. DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System has demonstrated its efficacy in optimizing scar healing and appearance.

Six days later, bilateral breast swelling, blisters, and eczematous, erythematous patches near the DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System were noted. Diphenhydramine did not relieve the pruritus. An oral steroid taper pack and hydroxyzine were prescribed. Although the dermatitis was not consistent with a drug rash, the cephalexin was stopped due to the risk for cross reactivity. Steroid taper was discontinued after five days due to gastrointestinal intolerance. At this time, the rash had intensified and spread from chest to arms, neck, and face. All drains and residual DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System were removed; the skin was washed with saline and covered with sterile mesh gauze impregnated with petrolatum 3% bismuth tribromophenate (Xeroform) and petrolatum ointment. A steroid taper was restarted and dermatology consult was made. Two days later, the rash had greatly improved.

Case 2\n\n【10】A 31-year-old Caucasian woman with a BMI of 24.2 with no history of allergic contact dermatitis or drug allergy  was prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate and the following sutures were utilized: deep polyglactin 910, subcuticular poliglecaprone 25, polyglactin 910, and rapidly absorbing plain gut for the nipple. Five days later, there was no rash. Twenty-three days later, a pruritic, erythematous rash along the intramammary incision was noted. Diphenhydramine did not alleviate symptoms. The remaining DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System was removed. The patient was given prednisone and scheduled with dermatology. One month later, the rash had resolved.\n\n【11】#### 4\\. Case 3\n\n【12】A 38-year-old African American woman with a BMI of 28.13 and an allergy to codeine and iodine  was prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate and the following sutures were utilized: deep polyglactin 910, deep poliglecaprone 25, and intracuticular poliglecaprone 25. The patient presented eight days later with numerous erythematous papules on the upper poles of the breasts that had presented that morning. Over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream had not alleviated symptoms. She was instructed to continue hydrocortisone. Ten days later, the rash had spread to her flexor forearms.

This case report discusses allergic contact reactions to DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System observed at our institution in patients undergoing reduction mammoplasties.\n\n【15】Few DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System side effects have been reported in the literature. One study comparing sutures to DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System in patients did not report any allergic reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In a retrospective study, 4 of 224 patients (1.8%) experienced an allergic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, these patients had prior DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System exposure, suggesting sensitization, consistent with a type IV hypersensitivity or cutaneous allergic contact dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. None of our patients had previous DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System exposure. A limitation of our study is that patients were not patch tested and we cannot rule out contact dermatitis. However, we would expect a greater patient population to demonstrate similar rashes if it were a contact dermatitis. As it has been suggested that DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System not be used for patients with a known or suspected allergy or sensitivity to cyanoacrylate, formaldehyde, tapes, or adhesives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, it would be interesting to determine if individuals with documented skin allergy are more prone to reactions. The likely allergen of DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System, cyanoacrylate, has wide-spread surgical and nonsurgical uses. Thus, patients must be screened for all past allergic reactions. The patients in the prior study were managed via topical corticosteroids and 20% azelaic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Our patients were primarily treated with oral steroids.\n\n【16】In our report, there were no observed wound infections. One study did find a nonstatistically significant increase in infections (2 versus 1 patient) in wounds closed with DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System versus sutures. The authors suggested this could be due to occlusion by DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【17】DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System may be just as, if not more, desirable as sutures. Studies have shown that patients prefer DERMABOND PRINEO Skin Closure System for its aesthetic outcome and decreased pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

The first cases of infections caused by this microorganism, such as pneumonia, soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, and meningitis, date back more than 40 years and are almost entirely in newborns and immunosuppressed hosts. Optimal antibiotic therapy for A. faecalis has not been well established in the literature. We report a case of an immunocompetent patient in Colombia who had meningitis due to A. faecalis after a dental procedure. It is important to know about this microorganism that nowadays could be considered a potentially emerging pathogen in immunocompetent adults.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Alcaligenes faecalis (A. faecalis) is an aerobic, nonfermentative, catalase and oxidase-positive, nonencapsulated, Gram-negative rod 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is named for its ability to produce an alkaline reaction in certain media 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. A. faecalis is the most frequently isolated member of the Alcaligenaceae family in the laboratory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. It could be found in the oil, water, and hospital environment, in objects such as mechanical ventilators, hemodialysis systems, and intravenous solutions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Although it is considered a normal saprophytic inhabitant of the human intestinal tract, it has been reported to cause dysentery and gastrointestinal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u> and has been isolated in urine, blood, wounds, feces, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and respiratory secretions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【5】A. faecalis usually causes opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts. In fact, it has been associated with severe infections such as peritonitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>, the latter being described mainly in neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Systemic and severe infections in immunocompetent hosts with this microorganism are very rare; there are limited data available. Herein, we present the first described case of meningitis due to A. faecalis in an immunocompetent adult in Colombia with a favorable outcome.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Description\n\n【8】A 30-year-old female with no relevant pathological history came to the emergency department due to seven days of fever and headache, with an intensity of 8/10 on the visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, photophobia, and neck pain. Subsequently, this was accompanied by an acute confusional syndrome, with variations in her behavior having aggressiveness and prosopagnosia.\n\n【9】On physical examination, vital signs were normal: blood pressure: 107/58 mmHg, mean blood pressure: 71 mmHg, heart rate: 88 beats/minute, respiratory rate: 18 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation: 99%, temperature: 36.2°C, and glucometer: 110 mg/dl. She was in poor general condition, stuporous, with neck stiffness accompanied by a positive Kerning and Brudzinski sign, a positive jolt accentuation sign, and an 11/15 Glasgow coma scale (GCS). The presence of a periodontal abscess was striking. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【10】At anamnesis, patient referred a persistent orodental pain which required a dental procedure fifteen days ago; she denied imaging realization and commented received an antibiotic (amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 hours) for 3 days ordered by a dentist. Blood tests reported the following: leukocytes: 4.87 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>, neutrophils: 52.80%, lymphocytes: 41.7%, hemoglobin: 7.7gr/dL; hematocrit: 25.4%; platelets: 361 × 10<sup>3</sup>/uL, glycemia 70 mg/dL, and initial chest X-ray was normal. A brain computed tomography (CT) was performed, reporting no space-occupying lesions, ischemic, hemorrhagic, and/or tomographic signs of intracranial hypertension.\n\n【11】With the described findings, central nervous system (CNS) infection was suspected, and due to disturbance of consciousness of fluctuating course, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for monitorization. Empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 hours) and corticosteroids (dexamethasone 10 mg every 6 hours) was started. Blood and urine cultures were taken.\n\n【12】A lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF cytochemical reported the following: glucose in liquid 58 mg/dl, proteins in liquid 70.80 mg/dl, colorless, appearance: transparent, pH: 8, density: 1000, leukocytes: 8.24 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>, polymorphonuclear cells: 60%, and mononuclear cells: 40%. A nonreactive nontreponemal test (VDRL), negative-staining India ink, and negative CSF culture for M. tuberculosis were obtained. Also, blood and urine cultures were reported as negative without any bacterial growth.\n\n【13】CSF culture reported single isolation of multisensitive A. faecalis .\n\n【14】Table 1 Results of antibiogram culture of CSF.\n\n【15】Considering the rareness of the microorganism isolated in an adult without obvious risks for this infection leads to concern that the single CSF culture isolate may have been a contaminant. Thus, the culture was repeated, yielding the same result, confirming the diagnosis of meningitis due to A. faecalis. The patient was assessed by infectious diseases, who recommended giving antibiotic management for 14 days.\n\n【16】Given favorable evolution, improvement in the state of consciousness, and GCS, she was transferred to the hospitalization ward to continue treatment for the next seven days. After completing antimicrobial coverage, the patient was discharged without sequelae or neurological repercussions.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】A. faecalis is an etiological agent infrequently cited in the literature as the cause of systemic infection in adults. It has been isolated in different clinical scenarios, and medical equipment and solutions have been found to be contaminated with this bacterium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5\\]</u>. This microorganism is recognized as an opportunistic pathogen responsible for serious infections in immunosuppressed hosts, newborns, and infants. Nevertheless, CNS infections are rare. In our case, it was not possible to demonstrate significant comorbidities or immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>, which makes this case relevant.\n\n【19】The published information is limited. The first reported literature dates back to case reports over 50 years old, primarily for pediatric patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>. Cases of hematogenous dissemination and meningitis derived from a case of dysentery in a 3-year-old infant, atypical presentations of septicemia and meningitis in newborns, and even hydrocephaly in a newborn are highlighted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>. We could not identify extensive cases of meningitis due to this causal agent in immunocompetent adults.\n\n【20】Additionally, the most extensive case series of infections due to A. faecalis reported in the literature included 191 cases, of which 45 were bacteremia, 36 were cystitis, 23 were skin and soft tissue infections, 23 were otitis media, and 16 were meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is worth to mention that we do not find evidence of Colombian cases in this retrospective analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, considering this case the first report in this regard.\n\n【21】Most isolations of A. faecalis, identified in blood or respiratory secretions, are related to contamination of hospital fluids or equipment, promoting colonization of the human host 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Despite that, when there are symptoms, it is important to rule out the route of infection and the associated organ compromised 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The mechanisms of inoculation of this bacterium are multiple. However, the symptomatic disease involves a complex interplay between the virulence factors of the pathogens and the host’s immune response. Weinstein and Wasserman describe a series of cases of A. faecalis infection, among which they report cases of meningitis after CNS procedures and trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Within this description, infections related to skull fracture, meningocele correction, or acute otitis media stand out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case, it is believed that the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of meningitis were the results of previous colonization of mucous membranes that, with the patient's dental procedure, favored the invasion of the bloodstream from the maxillary alveolar bone with subsequent hematogenous dissemination where the microorganism crossed the blood-brain barrier into the CSF.\n\n【23】It should be added that meningitis by A. faecalis and its clinical manifestations are not different from other CNS infections, a reason to why the patient presented with positive Kerning and Brudzinski sign, a positive jolt accentuation sign. In this case, we rule out other more frequent microorganisms that caused meningitis before the final diagnosis and discard that the microbiological isolation was due to contamination because the patient had symptoms and two CSF cultures with single isolation of A. faecalis.\n\n【24】The optimal antibiotic therapy for A. faecalis has not been well established in the literature and is often difficult to treat due to its increased resistance to several antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. The A. faecalis isolated in our case was multisensitive, which allowed the use of conventional antibiotics that cross the CNS to obtain a favorable response with no neurological sequelae.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【26】Our manuscript’s importance lies in the lack of scientific literature regarding cases of meningitis due to A. faecalis in immunocompetent adults and in the fact that it is the first case described in Colombia. In conclusion, meningitis due to A. faecalis is rare and usually occurs in newborns or infants. However, it has also been described in adults, our case being one of the few in the literature. It is important to know about this microorganism that nowadays could be considered a potentially emerging pathogen in immunocompetent adults.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The latest coronavirus infection due to SARS-CoV-2, which started in China in December 2019, was announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. All epidemiological data so far show us that SARS-CoV-2 infection is less serious in children than in adults. Allergic asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, is usually not to be related to greater risk or severity for COVID-19 in pediatric populations. Although reports/research on asthma and COVID-19 in children have thus far been comforting, when coming across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case Report. Here, we report a rare adolescent case of COVID-19-related pneumonia development with underlying asthma. A 16-year-old male patient has been followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of asthma for the last 5 years. He was thought to have typical clinical and laboratory findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with underlying pediatric (allergic) asthma. Pulmonary CT showed findings consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia. He was discharged after 1 week when all his complaints regressed, his examination became normal, and 5-day favipiravir treatment was completed. Conclusion. When a physician comes across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus pandemic, owing to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was later announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is the third highest known pathogen coronavirus, whose mortality rates range from 6 to 10.5%, depending on the comorbidity of the infected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. At least, a quarter of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are reported to have one of the chronic diseases as a comorbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Some of the comorbidities, especially chronic respiratory tract diseases (such as asthma and COPD) with long-standing drug treatments, may influence the development, therapy, and prognosis of COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Here, a rarely seen case of a 16-year-old adolescent male patient is discussed under the light of the current literature, since he developed severe COVID-19-related pneumonia with the preexisting diagnosis of asthma.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 16-year-old male patient has been followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of asthma for the last 5 years. The patient was regularly using daily montelukast 10 mg tablet and budesonide + formoterol 80/4.5 mcg 2x1 puffs in the maintenance treatment of asthma. His persistent asthma has been under control, and its severity is mild. His pulmonary function test (spirometry) was found to be within normal limits (predicted FEV1: 131%, FVC: 136%, FEV1/FVC: 92, and PEF: 90%) several times for the last 3 years. He was detected to be allergic to molds and wild grasses. A skin prick test showed indurations as negative control: 0 × 0 mm, positive control: 6 × 6 mm, Chenopodium album: 3 × 3 mm, and Cladosporium: 3 × 3 mm.\n\n【7】He had symptoms of persisting fever up to 39°C degrees in the morning and night for 5 days and cough with green sputum and described a very severe headache for 3-4 days in the last week. He assessed the severity of headache as 10/10 with a visual analog scale. Also, the patient was experiencing orthopneic dyspnea while coughing. It was learned that he had previous contact with a SARS-CoV-2-positive individual.\n\n【8】In the initial physical examination, he seemed to have mild dyspnea and tachypnea, body temperature was 39.5°C, heart rate: 110/min, respiratory rate: 38/min, and oxygen saturation: 88% (without oxygen support). Pulmonary auscultation revealed diffuse sibilant and subcrepitant rales on the anterior and posterior parts of both the lungs and on the left basal region at the end of inspiration and beginning of expiration. Rest of the physical examination was within the normal limit. According to the laboratory results, initial leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and platelet counts were decreased. In his routine biochemistry, AST and ALT levels were increased . Prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 such as CRP, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels were mildly elevated. PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were detected by nasopharyngeal swabs as positive twice. Serum immunoglobulins were within ±2 standard deviations of normal values. Pulmonary CT showed findings consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia. Diffuse ground glass-like consolidated nodular lesions in the left hemithorax of the patient continued to the lower lobes. Ground glass-like nodular lesions were also observed in the peripheral areas in the upper lobe and in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>.\n\n【9】Table 1 Laboratory results of the patient are shown.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The patient’s thorax CT images show radiologic findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. Diffuse ground glass-like consolidated nodular lesions in the left hemithorax continue to the lower lobes.</u>\n\n【11】He was thought to have typical clinical and laboratory findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with underlying pediatric (allergic) asthma. Final diagnosis is confirmed as COVID-19-related pneumonia with preexisting asthma. After diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, he was admitted to the pediatric COVID-19 inpatient service. In addition to maintenance fluid, favipiravir (2x8 tablets on the first day and 2x3 tablets for the rest of 4 days, po) and methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day, iv route) were given for COVID-19. Also, for pneumonia, ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day, 3 gr/day, iv), clarithromycin (15–20 mg/kg/day, 1 gr/day, po), and paracetamol (3-4x15 mg/kg/dose, po) were administered. Since the patient sometimes had up to 39.5°C fever and described an increase in cough and dyspnea during the admission, inhaled corticosteroid 80 mcg 4x1 puffs was added to his treatment on the 4<sup>th</sup> day of admission. Without oxygen support, oxygen saturation (SpO2) level was usually observed at >95%. He was discharged after 1 week when all his complaints regressed, his examination became normal, and 5-day favipiravir treatment was completed. He was later followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic. During follow-ups, his repeated spirometry values were within normal limits and he did not need any physical therapy (we have obtained an informed consent form from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report).\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】We are reporting a rare case of suffering from COVID-19-related pneumonia with preexisting pediatric allergic asthma. As described above in our case with asthma, SARS-CoV-2 positivity in PCR testing and findings of typical ground glass-like opacity in chest CT were consistent with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Because COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, certain diseases (such as congenital heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and some primary immune deficiency diseases) have been identified as a potential risk factor for COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, asthma has not been generally thought as a specific risk factor for severe COVID-19 development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. While some meta-analyses reported almost no data related to asthma patients, some others reported that asthma was thought to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality in hospitals. Where do asthmatic patients stand in this pandemic? Are asthmatic patients more inclined to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection? When afflicted, are asthmatic children at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19? Another issue is if the association between asthma and COVID-19 progress differs according to the age of the patient (adults vs. children) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>.\n\n【15】According to his initial laboratory results, leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and platelet counts decreased, which were related to myelosuppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection . According to the laboratory results, all his immunoglobulin levels were found to be normal except for total IgE. Overall, although these clinical and laboratory findings demonstrated the severity of the disease, the patient overcame the disease without need of oxygen support and intensive care unit treatment. This course was also consistent with a report of Turkish pediatric patients by Karbuz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Similar to our case, this report describes that pediatric asthma patients may have a symptomatic course but do not require mostly intensive care admission. In this report, cough was the key symptom in asthmatic cases (80.0%), and 87.6% of children with asthma were symptomatic (: 0.016). Nevertheless, being asthmatic was not always associated with disease gravity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. After 5 days of favipiravir treatment, liver function test (AST and ALT) levels of our patient were found to be doubled. This may be due to the use of the hepatotoxic effect of paracetamol and/or favipiravir 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In many nations, such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Italy, the asthma prevalence in COVID-19 cases was lesser than that detected in the overall population, while the contradictory findings were demonstrated in the USA, Australia, UK, and Ireland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In a Chinese study, only one of the 182 pediatric cases with COVID-19 was admitted in Wuhan had asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. On the other hand, in Brazil and New York, it was demonstrated that asthma was a common comorbidity, but was not linked with more severe COVID-19 leading to hospitalization or the need for intensive care therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In an online survey of 91 asthma specialists, caring for more than 133,000 pediatric asthma cases in 5 continents, only 14% of the responders described assumed COVID-19 patients among their cases; asthmatic children had mild symptoms in 73% of them, and only 1 patient needed hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Respiratory viruses are one of the recognized triggers of asthma attacks. Conventional coronaviruses are respiratory viruses and have been accused of both upper airway infections and asthma attacks upon infection. Reported entry receptors for most conventional coronaviruses do not include ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Even for asthma patients, it is difficult to distinguish respiratory COVID-19 symptoms such as chest tightness, coughing, and shortness of breath from an asthma exacerbation by other triggers. Consequently, it is crucial to draw attention to the surveillance and active management of chronic preexisting diseases in COVID-19 cases. In a study, mild bronchospasm was noticed in 24% of the cases, and oral steroids were used in only 1 case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In reality, COVID-19 has not been held responsible as an essential driver of viral wheezing or asthma attacks in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Favipiravir as an antiviral agent and anti-inflammatory methylprednisolone were used in his treatment. Corticosteroid therapy is the main treatment for asthma, but its use in viral pneumonia is debatable. Steroids are supposed to be able to antagonize some pathophysiological developments of acute respiratory distress syndrome, comprising extreme inflammatory response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. According to an assessment of the Cochrane system, glucocorticoids can lessen the fatality of cases with severe community-acquired pneumonia as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. There is a complex relationship among asthma, inhaled corticosteroid use, and ACE2 expression. According to Severe Asthma Research Program-3 (SARP-3), the use of inhaled corticosteroids is linked with a decreased level of ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) gene expressions in asthmatic patients which are the key entrance receptors for SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Also, all guidelines and experts suggest that asthma patients continue taking their inhaled corticosteroids using a metered-dose-inhaler (MDI) during this pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Some of the potential mechanisms suggested in the relevant literature for a milder COVID-19 course in asthmatic children are as follows. Seriousness and complications of any SARS-CoV-2 infection are linked with the production of hyperinflammation. In asthmatics, such hyperinflammation could be decreased by several factors including the hindered and ineffective antiviral reaction because of lessened IFN-α production by dendritic and epithelial cells. Nevertheless, the defensive role of eosinophilic inflammation, Th2 type inflammatory mediator (e.g. IL-4/-5/-13) predominance in the respiratory system, and antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of inhaled corticosteroids are also thought to play a strong role. Asthma and respiratory allergy, as a type 2 eosinophilic inflammation, and allergen exposures are connected with decreased expression of the ACE2 gene in bronchial epithelial cells. Eosinophils also might help in the reduction of viral load with subsequent attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26–28\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Due to stay-at-home orders, physical activity is restricted and the risk of contact with COVID-19-positive parents is greatly increased. The longer the stay at home, the greater the risk of further exposure to indoor allergens such as mold, rodents, cockroaches, and tobacco smoke. Indoor air quality and air conditioning will be more essential during stay-at-home times. Therefore, indoor plants where asthmatic children live are also very important as potential attack triggers.\n\n【21】Our strength in this report is that this is a rare allergic asthma case developing severe COVID-19-related pneumonia even under control with maintenance therapy. Our limitation is this is just one case, and it is hard to make definitive conclusion and does not reflect the whole reality on COVID-19 progress in these allergic asthma cases, especially controlled asthma cases.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【23】Although reports/research on asthma and COVID-19 in children have so far been comforting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) stated that “reliant on good judgment, rather than growing data” pediatric patients with asthma, particularly if severe or uncontrolled ones, should be contemplated to be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.\n\n【24】A take-home message from this case is when physicians come across an asthma patient in clinic with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30, 31\\]</u>. Nevertheless, even asthma patients under control could develop SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Maternal antibodies of IgG class can cross the placenta to result in alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. Antibodies to human neutrophil antigens anti-HNA-1a, HNA-1b, and HNA-2a have been most commonly reported to cause alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. Isoantibodies to Fc gamma RIIIb (CD16) if mother is a HNA-null phenotype are rarely involved in neonatal neutropenia. We report on a case of severe neutropenia (440 neutrophils/ L) due to anti-Fc gamma RIIIb (CD16) isoimmunization. On day 14 severe omphalitis developed, which was treated for 7 days by an antibiotic (ceftriaxone in a dose of 80 mg/kg/d) according to umbilical swab finding. Omphalitis persisted for 10 days in spite of antibiotic therapy and only resolved upon the introduction of rhG-CSF therapy. Therapy with rh-GCSF proved efficient and led to neutrophil count increase to 1970/ L and cure of omphalitis. However, therapeutic effect on granulocyte count was of transient nature, as granulocyte count fell to 760 n/ L on day 4 of therapy discontinuation. Neutropenia persisted for 2 months. The newborn was discharged from the hospital on day 26 with normal clinical status with clinical and laboratory control examinations at 2-week intervals.

The incidence of ANN has been estimated to 1 per 1000–6000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. ANN is the result of maternal alloimmunization to granulocyte antigens.

Case Report\n\n【12】A male newborn, birth weight 3540 g, was born from second, uncomplicated pregnancy, to a healthy 29-year-old mother, in 40th week of gestation. Mother had a normal neutrophil count. First borne child was healthy. Mother’s sister is of the same HNA-1-null genotype, delivered two healthy children.\n\n【13】Severe neutropenia (440 neutrophils/ L) with normal findings of other laboratory tests was detected on the first day of the newborn's life.\n\n【14】On day 14 severe omphalitis developed, which was treated for 7 days by an antibiotic (ceftriaxone in a dose of 80 mg/kg/d) according to umbilical swab finding.\n\n【15】Upon making the diagnosis of neonatal isoimmune neutropenia due to anti-Fc gamma RIIIIb (CD16) pan-reactive antibodies, therapy with rh-GCSF from day 19 to day 23 (Neupogen in a dose of 5  g/kg/d) was introduced . Therapy with rh-GCSF proved efficient and led to neutrophil count increase to 1970/ L and cure of omphalitis. However, therapeutic effect on granulocyte count was of transient nature, as granulocyte count fell to 760 neutrophils/ L on day 4 of therapy discontinuation. Neutropenia persisted for 2 months .

In the majority of ANN cases, the use of rh-GCSF resulted in a very rapid and steady neutrophil count increase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【32】In our patient, therapy with rh-GCSF proved efficient and led to an increase in neutrophil count and resolution of omphalitis. However, therapeutic effect on granulocyte count was transient, since granulocyte count showed a decline on day 4 of therapy discontinuation.\n\n【33】The child was discharged for home care with clinical and laboratory control examinations at 2-week intervals. No further bacterial infections were observed during the 8-week period of neutropenia. Therefore, we decided to follow up the course of the disease and to reintroduce rh-GCSF therapy in case of severe bacterial infection or sepsis development.\n\n【34】We believe that in case of a mild clinical course of the disease, a neonate benefits more from being discharged for home care than from insisting on normal neutrophil count achievement associated with prolonged hospital stay and potential exposure to hospital infections. Yet, we are fully aware of the risk of severe and protracted neutropenia.

Few MRI findings have been reported. We experienced an intradural extra-arachnoid lumbar disc herniation. We reviewed the preoperative MRI findings. Lumbar spine T2-weighted sagittal MRI showed that one line of the ventral dura was divided into two by a disc herniation. We speculated that the two lines comprised the dura and arachnoid and that a disc herniation existed between them. We believe that division of the ventral dural line on T2-weighted sagittal images is a characteristic finding of intradural extra-arachnoid lumbar disc herniation. The division of ventral dural line seemed to be a “Y,” and, thus, we called it the “Y sign.” The “Y sign” may be useful for diagnosing intradural extra-arachnoid lumbar disc herniation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Intradural extra-arachnoid lumbar disc herniation is a rare disease. Because of its rarity, few preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have been reported, thus making a preoperative diagnosis difficult. Subdural space leakage of contrast medium by discography is an important criterion for intradural extra-arachnoid disc herniation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is impossible to perform discography for all lumbar disc herniation cases, and no studies have reported specific MRI findings for discography. We experienced an intradural extra-arachnoid lumbar disc herniation case; here we report the MRI findings.\n\n【4】The patient was informed that his data would be submitted for publication, and he gave us his consent.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 56-year-old male was suffering from right thigh pain, numbness, and gait disturbance for 1 month before presentation.\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Neurological Examination\n\n【8】Neurological examination showed that his muscle power was normal in lower extremities and his right patellar tendon reflex was absent. Sensory disturbance was detected in the right thigh. The patient was diagnosed with right L3 radiculopathy. All laboratory findings were within normal limits.\n\n【9】##### 2.2. Radiological Findings\n\n【10】Lumbar spine MRI showed a mass compressing the dura that caudally migrated at the L2-L3 level on T2-weighted sagittal image 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. The mass continued to the disc and was assumed to be a lumbar disc herniation. The ventral dural line was divided into two near the disc herniation such that the herniation existed between these lines.

Durotomy revealed fragments covered with the arachnoid . After removing the fragments, we found a hole in the ventral aspect of the dura; this hole was connected to the disc space.

One year after surgery, he has returned to a normal daily life with moderate low back pain.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Dandy reported intradural lumbar disc herniation for the first time; the incidence of intradural lumbar disc herniation was between 0.04 and 0.33% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Because of rarity, the difference in radiological findings between intradural lumbar disc herniation and typical extradural lumbar disc herniation has been unclear. In some reports, the diagnosis was confirmed intraoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. The preoperative diagnosis of intradural lumbar disc herniation has been difficult. We thought that the characteristic radiological findings of intradural lumbar disc herniation were necessary.\n\n【20】Choi et al. reported useful MRI findings such as the “hawk-beak sign” and abrupt loss of posterior longitudinal ligament continuity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The “hawk-beak sign” was a sharp compressing lesion with a beak-like appearance to the dural sac on T2-weighted axial images.

One line of the dura and arachnoid was divided into two lines of the dura and the arachnoid. The branch of the ventral dural line appeared as “Y.” This branch may have been a characteristic appearance of intradural extra-arachnoid lumbar disc herniation, and, thus, we called it the “Y sign.” To our knowledge, such findings have not been reported previously.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Schema for intradural extra-arachnoid lumbar disc herniation.

Insufficiency fractures of pubic rami are rare occurrences in association with total hip arthroplasty (THA). Postoperative stress fractures occur due to increase of patients activity following years of disability. The physician should consider the possibility of a pelvic insufficiency fracture in patients with RA after THA, if the patients present with groin pain. We demonstrate here the first case of bilateral insufficiency fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone following THA.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】THA is effective for decreasing pain and improving the loss of function. Acute hip pain within the first few years after THA is unusual when the components are correctly positioned. The differential diagnosis, dislocation, infection, and periarticular bursitis or tendinitis, are considered. Insufficiency fracture around components also should be considered as part of differential diagnosis.\n\n【4】Several reports showed cases of insufficiency fracture of pubic rami after THA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. However, insufficiency fracture of bilateral pubic rami and iliac bone following THA has never been reported. Here, we report a case of a patient who complained of bilateral pelvic pain following bilateral THA who was found to have bilateral insufficiency fractures of pubic rami and iliac bone.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 62-year-old woman suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) underwent a left THA in 2007 and a right revision THA in 2009. The patient was treated with various doses of glucocorticoid for long term. After surgery, she was able to walk without support. However, ten months postoperatively, she presented with complaints of left groin pain that initially was associated with physical therapy sessions. The symptoms became more constant. She denied a history of a fall or of another traumatic event. Radiographs, at that time, did not show any significant findings. She was treated with anti-inflammatory medication and weight-bearing with use of a cane in the right hand. Over the next 2 months, the left groin pain was disappeared. After 4 month, the left pubic pain was recurrent. She did weight-bearing with use of a cane in the right hand again. However, she presented right groin pain several days later. Symptoms were worse with weight bearing and walking. Furthermore, several days later, both sides of buttock pain were presented and unable to walk.\n\n【7】Radiographs showed fractures of both pubic rami. Computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone . Evaluation for metabolic bone disease was performed. There was no significant evidence evaluated by blood examination.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | CT image showing pelvis.

By this time, all symptoms had subsided.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Stress fractures are classified into three subgroups: fatigue fracture caused by repetitive stress for normal bone, insufficiency fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile bone, and pathologic fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile invaded bone by tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Zwartelé et al. reported systematic reviews of cementless THA in RA patients, and they concluded that cementless acetabular cups were rarely associated with mechanical complications including acetabular fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, Fukunishi et al. reported that 11 patients in 171 RA patients (6.4%) who underwent cemented THA suffered from pubic rami fractures postoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Isdale reported the bone quality in RA patients was poor, and insufficiency fractures of the pubic rami in RA appear to be more common than had been recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our case, the subtype of stress fracture is thought to be classified into insufficiency fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile bone due to RA. The bone quality of this patient might be poor, because the patient was treated with glucocorticoid for long term.\n\n【13】The patient performed revision THA by using Kerboull-type acetabular reinforcement device. Several reports demonstrated the results postoperatively using Kerboull-type acetabular reinforcement device 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. However, there was no report of pubic rami fracture after THA. Therefore, the fracture may not be associated with acetabular component design.\n\n【14】Most pelvic insufficiency fractures occur in women, particularly those with osteoporotic bone. The patients have impaired activity levels prior to THA. After surgery, many of these patients are pain free and get activity at a much higher level than preoperatively. Therefore, they are susceptible to the development of an insufficiency fracture if the bone quality is poor. In our case, the mechanism of fracture is thought as follows. Firstly, the insufficiency fracture of left pubic rami occurred due to daily activity. The patient was placed on limited weight-bearing, with use of a cane in the right hand. This increased the stress on the right side, and the fracture of right pubic rami was occurred. Both sides of pubic fracture increased the stress on both iliac bone, and the fractures of both iliac bones were caused.\n\n【15】Insufficiency fractures are differentiated from acute fractures, which occur early in the postoperative period as a result of press-fit insertion of cementless acetabular components in osteopenic bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The physician should consider the possibility of a pelvic insufficiency fracture in patients with RA after THA. If the patient presents with groin pain, the patient should be treated with weight-bearing as conservative management.\n\n【17】However, pelvic discontinuity by both pubic rami and iliac bone fracture occurred in our case; even we recommended weight-bearing at the time of initial fracture of left pubic rami.

What Is Your Diagnosis?\n\n【9】##### 2.1. Diagnosis: Human Orf (Ecthyma Contagiosum)\n\n【10】Case Synopsis  \nA 61-year-old sheep farmer presented with a painful nonpruritic ulcerated lesion on the left hand that had been present for approximately 5 weeks. He neither had previous history of similar lesions nor did he have a history of cancer or other dermatologic conditions. Physical examination demonstrated a 1 cm pearly, umbilicated papule with raised borders .  \nA biopsy  showed an asymmetrical nodule with parakeratotic crust and acanthosis with thin epidermal strands extending deeply in the underlying dermis. The upper dermis showed marked edema and capillary proliferation. The deeper dermal part of the lesion showed extensive lymphocytic infiltration. One red intranuclear inclusion was identified in the epidermal keratinocyte .\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Our patient was a sheep farmer who presented with a raised umbilicated pearly lesion of his left hand that was ulcerated with raised borders. Clinically, it could easily be mistaken for a basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The central umbilication could also suggest keratoacanthoma or a lesion caused by molluscum infection though such lesions are usually much smaller. Milker’s nodules should be considered too. Both the clinical history of sheep farming and the microscopic features including the eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion body in the keratinocyte suggest a diagnosis of human orf (ecthyma contagiosum). The diagnosis may be further confirmed by electron microscopy done on the fluid obtained from the orf lesion showing ovoid cross-hatched virions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), although not readily available, can definitely identify orf virus from frozen tissue specimens, vesicle material, or scab debris from orf lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Ecthyma contagiosum is a zoonotic disease caused by the parapoxvirus that causes “sore mouth” in sheep and goats and orf in human. In ruminants, it is evidenced by exudative lesions found on the muzzle, eyelids, oral cavity, feet, or external genitalia. It is more common in younger animals. The disease in ruminants is highly contagious to humans and other animals; infected sheep and also freshly vaccinated sheep or goats are the source of infection to people. Transmission can be by direct contact with lesions or indirectly from contaminated object such as hair or clothing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Parapoxvirus is made up of a dense DNA core surrounded by a less dense capsid and 2 narrow electron dense outer layers. After an incubation period of 3–7 days, parapoxvirus infections produce 1–3 painful lesions measuring 1-2 cm in diameter. During the next 6–8 weeks, the lesion passes through 6 clinical stages: maculopapular, target, acute weeping, nodular, papillomatous, and finally regressive stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Microscopically, in the maculopapular stage, there is vacuolization of cells in the upper third of the stratum malpighii leading to multilocular vesicles. Eosinophilic intranuclear or cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be seen. Vacuolated epidermal cells with inclusion bodies characterize the target stage. Ballooning degeneration also occurs in the target stage and affects keratinocytes rupture with a tendency to coalesce and produce reticulated vesicles. Additionally, in the epidermis, there is an elongation of the rete ridges. Many newly formed dilated capillaries and a mononuclear infiltrate are present in the dermis. This is followed by the acute weeping stage which is characterized by necrosis and a massive infiltrate of mononuclear cells throughout the dermis. Some biopsies of orf may have a marked reactive lymphoid infiltrate with CD30 positive T cells mimicking lymphoma. On progression to the nodular stage, a lichenoid reaction with a high percentage of histiocytes is seen in the skin. In the final papillomatous stage finger-like downward projections are displayed in the epidermis along with vasodilatation and chronic inflammation in the dermis. This results in resolution and regression of the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The natural history of the disease is complete resolution and no treatment is indicated. But antiseptic agents to prevent the superinfection and in some selected cases imiquimod can be applied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Although, immunity is short lived, reinfection frequently appears but no human-to-human transmission occurs. Investigation into prevention of ecthyma contagiosum in ruminants through vaccination is thought to be the best way to control infection. Vaccines are available that offer some efficacy in sheep but do not prevent disease in goats. Research into effective and economical vaccines is ongoing. If infection is controlled in the ruminant population, human infection and its economic and environmental consequences should decrease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The epidemiology of peripheral neuropathy is limited since the disease presents with varying etiology, pathology, and severity. Toxic, inflammatory, hereditary, and infectious factors can cause damage to the peripheral nerves resulting in peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy is most commonly caused by diabetes, alcohol, HIV infection, and malignancy. We report a case of a 42-year-old female with 10-year history of progressively worsening peripheral neuropathy, hypothyroidism, and skin changes who presents with dyspnea secondary to recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. Prior to her arrival, her peripheral neuropathy was believed to be secondary to chronic demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy (CDIP) given elevated protein in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) which was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids. Unfortunately, her peripheral neuropathy did not have any improvement. Incidentally, patient was found to have splenomegaly and papilledema on physical exam. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a monoclonal pattern of IgA lambda. Patient met the diagnostic criteria for POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes) syndrome. An underlying diagnosis of POEMS syndrome should be considered in patients with chronic debilitating neuropathy and an elevated protein in the CSF.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 42-year-old South Asian female with a history of 10 years of disabling peripheral neuropathy treated with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) without improvement. About 1 year ago, she developed hypertrichosis, skin hyperpigmentation, and nail clubbing and whitening 通用删除1(英):<u>(nail clubbing, Figure 1; hypertrichosis and nail whitening, Figure 2)</u>. She also developed hypothyroidism 1 year ago. Evaluation of a headache 1 year ago revealed that the patient had bilateral papilledema. Complete blood count showed a white blood count of 7.8, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 31.9%, and platelets of 306. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis from a lumbar puncture showed a total protein of 63 g/dL. Patient was presumed to have CDIP. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a monoclonal pattern of IgA lambda. She also began to have to functional decline and significant weight loss for the past 2 years. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions . For the past 3-4 months, she developed dyspnea secondary to recurrent pleural effusions and pericardial effusions requiring multiple thoracenteses and pericardiocentesis, respectively. A CT Scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed splenomegaly and ascites . A whole body skeletal survey revealed osteosclerotic lesions of the left iliac bone and proximal left femur . By piecing together distinct signs and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is POEMS syndrome. There is no single laboratory test that can be performed to diagnose POEMS syndrome. Multiple signs and symptoms are associated together to establish the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome. Two major criteria: polyneuropathy and monoclonal plasmaproliferative disorder and at least 1 minor criterion: osteosclerotic myeloma, Castleman's disease, organomegaly, endocrinopathy (excluding diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism), edema, typical skin changes, and papilledema are required for diagnosis of POEMS syndrome defined by a retrospective review at the Mayo Clinic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Pathogenesis\n\n【10】The exact cause of POEMS syndrome is poorly understood, although proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated as a cause of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>. Patients with POEMS syndrome had higher serum levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 and lower serum levels of TGF beta 1 than did patients with multiple myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a good pathogenic marker in POEMS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>; it induces a rapid and reversible increase in vascular permeability and neovascularization. The overproduction of VEGF is important in the pathogenesis of POEMS syndrome. Our patient had an Interleukin-6 level of 26.3 pg/mL (0–14 pg/mL) and a VEGF level of 1960 pg/mL (31–86 pg/mL). After chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, the symptoms of the syndrome improved along with the decrease in serum VEGF levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The median age of patients diagnosed with POEMS syndrome is 51 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Peripheral neuropathy is a significant feature of the syndrome and a required criterion for diagnosis. The peripheral neuropathy is ascending, with either an insidious or rapidly progressing onset. Patients often initially have numbness and dysesthesias which is then followed by a progressive ascending weakness that overshadows the sensory impairment. Increased cerebral spinal fluid protein was seen in all the patients from a case series. Sixty-seven to eighty-four percent of patients will have an endocrine abnormality at presentation with hypogonadism being the most common and fifty percent of the patients had organomegaly (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy). Two-thirds of the patients had skin changes (hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, acrocyanosis, plethora, and hemangioma/telangiectasia).\n\n【12】A retrospective case series showed overall median survival was 165 months. There has not been a documented case of POEMS syndrome in a South Asian American prior to this case report. Previously, there were case series in Chinese patients, Japanese patients, and non-Asians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Prognostic markers for survival included fingernail clubbing and extravascular fluid overload (edema, effusion, or ascites). Patients with clubbing or volume overload had a median survival of 31 and 79 months, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【13】More than half the patients respond to radiation therapy with nonneurologic manifestations improving prior to neurologic manifestations. Patients with a solitary lesion or a dominant lesion are treated with radiation therapy as first-line therapy. The hypothesis implicating vascular endothelial growth factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u> eventually may be validated, providing a uniform target for therapy. Systemic and skin symptoms tend to respond sooner than do symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, with the former beginning to respond within 1 month, and the neuropathy responds within 3 to 6 months. Many treatment strategies other than radiation therapy have been used, including plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, interferon alfa, corticosteroids, alkylators, azathioprine, autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), tamoxifen, and transretinoic acid. The current mainstay treatment for POEMS is radiation therapy and alkylator-based therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. There have been promising results with the use of high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan and autologous blood stem cell transplantation.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】There is vast spectrum of causes of peripheral neuropathy, which commonly include diabetes, alcohol abuse, and HIV infection. Our patient suffered from 10 years of chronic peripheral neuropathy, and she had an extensive workup by multiple physicians. Ultimately, she was diagnosed with POEMS syndrome, a rare paraneoplastic syndrome from a plasma cell dyscrasia, which most commonly presents with peripheral neuropathy. Although uncommon, POEMS syndrome should be considered among patients with chronic peripheral neuropathy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "46552b67-1574-4b4e-9950-b242a1ebae95", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Background. Peripheral blood smear examination is an invaluable laboratory test, which provides the complete hematologic and/or nonhematologic picture of a case. In addition to verifying the results of automated cell counters, it has the potential to identify some pathologic and morphologic changes that remain hidden using the cell counters alone. Case Presentation. A 40-year-old man with a three-year history of alcohol intake and marijuana abuse presented with severe lower extremities of the bone and abdominal pain. Physical examination showed high blood pressure, high pulse rate, and abdominal tenderness. He underwent extensive laboratory and imaging tests, and cholecystectomy and bone marrow studies were associated with no definite diagnosis. Right after all these invasive, expensive, and time-consuming investigations during a month, finding coarse basophilic stippling in the red blood cells in the peripheral blood smear by an expert led to the final diagnosis. Elevated blood lead level and the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow study confirmed the diagnosis of lead poisoning, and the patient responded well to chelator therapy in a short period. Conclusion. This case clearly showed the value of peripheral blood smear review and its impact on patient care. In order not to lose the cases, laboratories are recommended to design their own policy for peripheral blood smear review. The peripheral blood smear is the fastest, simplest, and most available screening test, which can prevent many misdiagnoses and malpractices. It provides rich morphological information, among which basophilic stippling is highly suggestive of lead poisoning.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】A manual blood smear review is defined as the thorough and careful microscopic analysis of a well-prepared and stained smear of peripheral blood, with the objective of seeking morphological changes relevant to the diagnosis and monitoring of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Laboratory-initiated examinations of blood smears for patients with anemia are usually the result of a laboratory policy, according to which a blood smear is ordered whenever the hemoglobin concentration is unexpectedly low. In these cases, despite the wealth of the captured information from modern automated cell counters, including red cell count, mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and red cell distribution width (RDW), there are still morphologic abnormalities that are critical in the differential diagnosis of anemia and can be determined only from a blood smear. The detection of variations in the cell shape and red cell inclusions, such as Howell–Jolly bodies, Pappenheimer bodies, and basophilic stippling or punctate basophilia, is highly important. The latter can be suggestive of lead poisoning according to the clinical data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 40-year-old man was transferred to our center at Abu Ali Sina Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, to be evaluated for severe bone pain and abdominal pain for a month, which was worsened one week ago. It was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and constipation. The patient was also complaining of severe weight loss (15 kg during a month). His past medical history was not significant, and he was not taking any medication. He was a fast-food worker with a history of excessive alcohol intake over three years, with no periods of abstinence. He was drinking 1-2 liters of homemade alcohol (using a traditional container for distillation) daily until few days prior to admission. Additionally, he reported a history of on and off synthetic marijuana abuse until three days prior to admission. The bone pain was mostly limited to the lower extremities, and the abdominal pain was severe with a colicky pattern and radiation to both scrotums. Physical examination was significant for high blood pressure (180/100 mmHg), tachycardia (108/min), low-grade fever (37.9°C), and pallor with abdominal and scrotal tenderness. There was no gingival hyperpigmentation, and all deep tendon reflexes were unremarkable.\n\n【6】Laboratory investigations at presentation showed moderate microcytic and hemolytic anemia in addition to significantly elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Abdominopelvic sonography and CT scan showed biliary sludge and small liver hemangioma, respectively. Other laboratory and imaging investigations (color Doppler sonography of the mesenteric artery and vein, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and colonoscopy) were unremarkable. He underwent cholecystectomy with the impression of acute cholecystitis, and the microscopic pathologic diagnosis was just chronic cholecystitis without cholelithiasis. Due to the presence of unexplained anemia and severe bone pain, a bone marrow study was done for him to rule out leukemia, which was in favor of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with 10% ring sideroblasts . The cytogenetic study was normal. Complete blood count (CBC) test with peripheral blood smear (PBS) checking (according to our policy in the hematology laboratory) was done for the patient several times at presentation and during hospitalization. Peripheral blood film examinations, stained by the Wright–Giemsa method, revealed mild to moderate anemia, microcytic hypochromic red blood cells with anisocytosis, polychromasia, and also frequent coarse basophilic stippling of the red cells 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>; the last one was missed at the first PBS review. Regarding the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow report, the possibility of lead poisoning was considered, and surprisingly, the blood lead level (measured on K2EDTA-whole blood by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) was markedly raised (151 µg/dL; reference range was 10 µg/dL). Since there was no occupational exposure, the traditional distillation dish (made of copper and lead) was traced as the possible source of lead.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bone marrow smear showing that about 10% of erythroid precursors are ring sideroblasts (arrow) (Perl’s Prussian blue stain, ×1000).</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a, b) Peripheral blood smear with basophilic stippling of red blood cells  (Wright–Giemsa, ×1000).</u>\n\n【9】The patient stopped drinking alcohol and marijuana abuse. Chelating therapy with succimer was initiated with a dose of 500 mg (5 capsules) daily, and after four weeks, the blood lead level declined to 25 µg/dl, and he had a weight gain of 6 kg. All signs and symptoms were removed, and all laboratory findings changed to normal condition. Additionally, no clinical or laboratory deficits were noted during the 6-month follow-up visits. Informed consent was requested and obtained from the patient for publishing the case report and the accompanying images. Although some reports are supporting the correlation between hypertension and lead poisoning, in our case, marijuana withdrawal could also be the cause of sympathetic overactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Table 1 shows the transition of laboratory data from the first presentation to recovery time.\n\n【10】Table 1 The initial and posttreatment results (after 4 weeks) of the laboratory tests.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】CBC is the most commonly ordered test in hospitalized patients. Modern automated blood cell counters produce a detailed report on the red cells, white cells, and platelets, with differential white blood cell counts. A drop of the remaining blood could then be smeared and stained 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Microscopic examination of this smear under the expert eye yields useful information and further details regarding all formed elements of blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. “More information can be gained from examining the blood smear than any other single hematologic procedure,” Jandl in 1987 said 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This shows the value of PBS review in medical management. Initiation of a PBS review depends on the laboratory policy. It can be a clinical request by the attending clinician due to clinical suspicion or can be initiated by the laboratory due to clinical information, numerical deviations in the automated counts, flags raised by the analyzers, or based on a designed protocol in the laboratory (based on the workload of the laboratory) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7\\]</u>. For certain disorders, for instance, hematologic malignancies or parasitic infestations, examination of the PBS can be diagnostic. For others, such as our case, the PBS provides important clues in the clinical management and determines which diagnostic tests are indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Among all useful data obtained from the blood smear, valuable information about the red blood cell size, shape, staining (color), and intracellular inclusions can be obtained. Red cell inclusions often result from defective maturation of the erythrocytes, oxidant injury to the cells, or infections and are almost always indicative of some sort of pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Basophilic stippling (punctuate basophilia) is well-known red cell inclusions. The occurrence of basophilic stippling is caused by aggregates of ribosomes or fragments of ribosomal RNA precipitating throughout the cytoplasm of erythrocytes. These inclusions stain a deep blue color with Wright’s stain, and unlike other erythrocyte inclusions, they lack polarity and are dispersed throughout the cell. The inclusions might have a coarse or fine appearance, and these different morphologies can be linked to particular disease processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Fine basophilic stippling may be seen artifactually and is linked to increased production of the red cells, while coarse basophilic stippling is always clinically significant. Classically, coarse basophilic stippling is associated with heavy metal toxicity with a focus on lead poisoning. Patients with anemia secondary to hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease can demonstrate basophilic stippling that is finer than that seen in lead toxicity. Lead can increase membrane permeability; furthermore, it can alter erythrocyte morphology, giving rise to macrocytic and echinocytic forms as well as basophilic stippling. Lead toxicity causes coarse basophilic stippling due to suppression of pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase, which prevents ribosomal RNA breakdown in circulating erythrocytes. In lead poisoning, basophilic stippling is a pathognomonic feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–11\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Lead exposure usually occurs through contaminated air and food. Excess lead affects almost every organ in the body. The major anatomic targets are the blood (bone marrow), nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Lead has a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups and interferes with the enzymes involved in heme synthesis. Iron incorporation into heme is impaired, leading to microcytic hypochromic anemia with distinctive punctate basophilic stippling of the red cells. Lead also inhibits sodium- and potassium-dependent ATPases in the cell membranes, which may increase the fragility of red cells, causing hemolytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The classic form of lead neuropathy consists of weakness that primarily involves the wrist and finger extensor (wrist drop and foot drop). Excess lead could induce “lead lines” formation in epiphyses of the bone and gum. The gastrointestinal tract is also a locus for major clinical manifestations. Lead “colic” is characterized by extremely severe, poorly localized abdominal pain, and finally, because the excretion of lead occurs through the kidneys, exposures may cause damage to the proximal tubules, interstitial fibrosis, and possibly renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Since lead poisoning is a condition with potential multiorgan damage, it can be traced in the human body with various laboratory tests. The half-life of lead in the blood and bone is 35 days and 32 years, respectively; thus, the blood lead level just reflects the current and recent exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 13\\]</u>. Table 2 shows different laboratory tests, their properties, and changes in cases of lead poisoning. Elevated blood lead (>10 µ/dL) and red cell-free protoporphyrin levels (>50 µg/dL) or, alternatively, zinc protoporphyrin levels, are required for definitive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Table 2 Change of different laboratory tests in lead poisoning.\n\n【20】Impairment of the hematological system is one of the earliest signs of lead accumulation and could be characteristic. Even in milder cases of lead exposure, anemia may be the only obvious abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The PBS is the fastest, simplest, and cost-effective test, which can also be made and examined at emergency and screening rooms at hospitals and could prevent unnecessary laboratory tests and other invasive diagnostic procedures, including inappropriate laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Because this process is among the most time-consuming ones in hematology laboratories and requires high technical competence to minimize the errors of subjectivity, each laboratory should make its policy to review the blood smears. Providing clinical data including occupational and environmental health history through communication between the clinicians and the laboratory team could lead to a more rapid and accurate diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Our patient was a case of chronic lead poisoning with atypical symptoms and signs, such as severe bone pain and highly elevated liver enzymes, which caused delayed diagnosis. In this case, a lot of laboratory and imaging workups, including hematologic tests (and also the initial PBS) failed to reach a correct diagnosis, while the second PBS review by an expert clarified the long and painful story. We believe that even the first PBS review may discover the problem if it is reviewed accurately and/or is provided with typical clinical data.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】This case emphasizes that all patients with unknown diseases should be evaluated in terms of PBS at the first workup, and the PBS in all patients (hematologic and nonhematologic) should be reviewed systematically regarding all blood elements. Lead poisoning is more common than our estimation. As clinical manifestations are nonspecific and may be misdiagnosed with other pathophysiological conditions, at least it should be included in differential diagnosis lists of adult unexplained anemia (especially in the setting of matched clinical data), and basic initiative laboratory tests, such as PBS, could rule out the need for invasive, expensive, and time-consuming procedures.\n\n【24】#### Abbreviations\n\n| ALT: | Alanine aminotransferase |\n| --- | --- |\n| ALP: | Alkaline phosphatase |\n| AST: | Aspartate aminotransferase |\n| BUN: | Blood urea nitrogen |\n| BM: | Bone marrow |\n| CBC: | Complete blood count |\n| Cr: | Creatinine |\n| ESR: | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate |\n| HB: | Hemoglobin |\n| LDH: | Lactate dehydrogenase |\n| MCH: | Mean cell hemoglobin |\n| MCHC: | Mean cell hemoglobin concentration |\n| MCV: | Mean cell volume |\n| MDS: | Myelodysplastic syndrome |\n| PBS: | Peripheral blood smear |\n| PLT: | Platelet |\n| RDW: | Red cell distribution width |\n| WBC: | White blood cell. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In Latin America, case series have been published, and it does not exceed 32 patients in 10 years, and in Colombia, there are case reports. We present a descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study in patients diagnosed with MCC in the Department of Pathology and Laboratories at the University Hospital Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá(FSFB) between January 2003 and December 2018. We present the demographic, clinical, and pathological variables of these patients, as well as a literature review.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy with unknown cellular origin, and current information reveals a trilinear differentiation; epithelial, neuroendocrine, and early B cell lymphocytic carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. 5-year survival for advanced-stage MCC has been reported between 0 and 18% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, the incidence of Merkel cell carcinoma is about 3 per 1000000 worldwide, and incidences appear to be increased either due to an aging population or improved detection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. MCC incidence varies by geographic regions, and it ranges from 0.13 per 100000 person-years in Europe to 1.6 per 100000 person-years. It accounts for <1% of cutaneous cancers in Europe based on a retrospective cohort study with 20 diagnosed MCC cases. In Colombia and Latin America, there are some reports published; one of the biggest reports is from Carneiro et al. with 32 cases presented in a period of 10 years in the Instituto Nacional de Cancer, on which they report late diagnosis that leads to high lethality by invasive disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Many reports of case series have identified the clinical features of MCC, and typically it present as a firm, painless red-violet nodule that is dome-shaped and has undergone rapid growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Nodules are common in areas exposed to sun, most frequently occur on head and neck, and less common on lower limbs, trunk, or other areas not exposed to sunlight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. History of extensive sun/ultraviolet (UV) exposure is recognized as a likely risk factor, and others include older age (most patients > 65 years old), Caucasian ethnicity, polyomavirus infection (reported 45%–100% of cases of MCC), and immunosuppressive states 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 7\\]</u>. Some authors have described that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) positive displayed very low mutation rates, but MCC polyomavirus negative exhibited a high mutation burden associated with a UV-induced DNA damage signature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. UV-induced damage is associated with the anatomic site of presentation and could differ by sex from the information of population surveillance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【5】For the definitive diagnosis, a biopsy is required; histology of MCC typically shows hyperchromatic nuclei and high mitotic activity on hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining. Histologic subtypes include intermediate type-most common, characterized by basophilic nuclei with high mitotic activity; trabecular type-rare usually only seen in mixed tumors; and small cell type-undifferentiated and may be identical to small-cell carcinomas of other sites, and less common morphological subtypes include glandular, squamous, and melanocytic carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. An immunohistochemistry study has to be performed with the appropriated immunopanel, and cytokeratin 20 (CK-20) was reported to be positive in 89%–100% of cases of MCC and considered testing for other neuroendocrine tumor markers to exclude other differential diagnoses including chromogranin A and synaptophysin.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【7】A retrospective review of all pathology samples with diagnosis of MCC and/or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma in the skin was conducted in the University Hospital Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá between January 2003 and December 2018. Approval from the Institutional Review Board was obtained before data collection. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record, and each case was compared to electronic pathology records to find pathological characteristics reported.\n\n【8】The medical information was reviewed and compared to the reported in the pathology database for each analyzed case, and then each pathology slide was reviewed and aditional clinically relevant information was included in a medical independent database designed for this investigation. Cases found in the database and identify as repeated were excluded.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【10】A total of 36 patients included in the review during the 10 years were analyzed in our pathology lab; there were 12 men (55.6%) and 16 women (44.4%), with a median age of 68 years (range 17–87 years). Clinicopathological characteristics of MCC are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1; the head and neck were the most common locations. 41% followed by the primary site were unknown and the last was skin without other specification (8.3%). Cytokeratin 7 was positive in 2 patients (5.6%), cytokeratin 20 was positive in 33 patients (91.1%), chromogranin A was positive in 25 patients (83.3%), and synaptophysin was positive in 24 patients (96.0%).\n\n【11】Table 1 Patient characteristics.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Tumor localization.</u>\n\n【13】We analyzed the localization by sex , and it showed that unknown primary site was 2 (12.5%) in female and 7 (35%) in male, skin without specification was 0 in women and 3 (15%) in men, head and neck localization was 6 (37.5%) in women and 9 (45%) in men; upper limb 4 (25%) in women and 0 in men, and lower limb in women was 4 (25%) and 1 (5%) in men. Figure 2 shows the distribution of localization by sex. We match the CK-20 results with neuroendocrine markers; CK-20 was positive in 30 of the neuroendocrine markers (93.8%), and 2 CK-20 positive were negative for neuroendocrine markers. 2 samples negative for CK-20 were positive for neuroendocrine markers and one sample did not have CK-20 result.\n\n【14】Table 2 Population.\n\n【15】Table 3 Localization by sex.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Distribution by sex.</u>\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare skin tumor and its diagnosis is difficult. The diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma is confirmed with immunohistochemical stains for distinction from other small-cell malignancies, as small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or lymphoma. CK-20 is a marker for MCC and is found positive in 89–100% of cases, other neuroendocrine markers that are used to support the diagnosis of MCC are synaptophysin and chromogranin, and others are positively stained by MCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This series of cases shows the experience of Merkel diagnosis in 16 years in a reference center of pathology.\n\n【19】This review shows the clinical presentation and the confirmatory immunohistochemical stains  to differentiate from other neuroendocrine tumors. From this analysis, the head and neck were the most common localization, followed by primary site unknown, and this review similar to others reports of Hitchcock et al. who reported primary site lesion as head and neck 48.9%, upper extremities 15.6%, and lower extremities 30.2%, but without report of the unknown primary site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Heath et al. reported the unknown primary site in 14% of 195 cases similar to this study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, which is less in limbs due to reports of skin without other specifications in our study.\n\n【20】Table 4 Neuroendocrine markers vs. CK-20 status.\n\n【21】This review of 37 cases of diagnosis of MCC also showed a trend in limb localization for women, especially in lower limbs. 25% in upper limb and lower limb in women and 0% and 5%, respectively, in men. It differs from the study by Agelli et al. that reported similar presentations in limbs by sex in males (20.6% upper limbs and 17.5% lower limbs) and females (17.5% in upper limbs and 14.4% in lower limbs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. These gender differences are not well explained in this study; we hypothesized that these differences could be possible due to exposure of limbs to sunlight in women in tropical countries because of wearing skirts. The association of gender and upper limbs are described in melanoma studies. Guiasvand et al. reported a stronger risk factor for melanoma on lower limbs (RR 3.38; 95% CI, 2.62–4.38) in Norwegian women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Another explanation could be the relationship between positive MCPvV in female patients which is more prevalent than in male patients (66.7% vs 39.6) and MCPyV and MCC are more common in limbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. However, there is not enough available information in Latin American countries to explain this finding.\n\n【22】#### Disclosure\n\n【23】This report was presented as a poster at the 31st European Congress of Pathology in Nice, France.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We present here two cases of renal ES/PNET with an uncanny presentation. The first case was discovered after the patient presented clinically with irradiating flank pain, mimicking the pain related with kidney stones. The second case had clinical presentation of pulmonary thromboembolism after the patient was involved in an automobilist accident. The tumors were mainly composed of small blue cells which by immunohistochemical were positive for neural markers, and FISH revealed the translocation 22q12 for the EWSR1 gene. The diagnosis of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor is very rare and usually involves several different diagnostic techniques. The differential diagnosis is usually broad with frequent overlapping features between the entities. The cases presented in this paper illustrated the difficulties with which routine anatomical pathologist is faced when dealing with rare renal poorly differentiated neoplasm in adults.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

She was clinically diagnostic with kidney stones and indeed a kidney stone was identified. However, the computed tomography scan revealed a large right renal mass and right ovarian cystic mass. The patient underwent a right-sided laparoscopic radical nephrectomy along with an excision of the ovarian cystic mass. Her postoperatively course was uneventful except for some pain in the surgical incision site. Grossly, an 11 cm cyst adenofibroma of the right fallopian tube and ovary was identified. In addition, the kidney showed an 8.3 cm encapsulated tumor located at the pelvic adipose tissue within the renal capsule 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Microscopically, the tumor cells were arranged in solid sheets, tightly packed cords, trabeculae with variable stroma, and nests or ribbons of uniform small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm, uniform nuclei, and stippled chromatin.

A month later, the patient returned to the emergency room with complaints of shortness of breath, icterus, and dark urine. A chest-computed tomography scan revealed pulmonary embolism. She underwent a pulmonary embolism protocol which included a computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The exam showed extensive central bilateral pulmonary embolism and a large right atrial thrombus in continuity with thrombotic material within the inferior vena cava. In addition, her right kidney had poorly contrast-enhancing raising the possibility of a right renal vein thrombosis extending into the right atrium with subsequent pulmonary embolism. She underwent a pulmonary tumor embolectomy, right atrial mass removal, and tumor embolectomy thrombectomy of the hepatic inferior vena cava as well as placement of an inferior vena cava filter. The patient underwent a sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. She started chemotherapy with etoposide and ifosfamide combination therapy. The tumor invaded the renal vein and extended to the resection margin. The histological examination of the right atrial, pulmonary artery, and caval vein thrombus revealed islands of uniform small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm, uniform nuclei, and stippled chromatin intermixed with necrosis and blood clot 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. The viable tumor cells showed brisk mitosis. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using the usual avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method.

Discussion\n\n【15】The diagnosis of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor is very rare and usually involves several different diagnostic techniques. The most challenging part is the differential diagnosis which is broad with morphological and immunohistochemical overlapping features between the entities. Therefore, mostly frequently molecular biology techniques need to be applied for a definitive diagnosis. We reported 2 cases of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor with an unusual clinical presentation which were incidentally found during imaging. These cases illustrated very well the difficulties with which general pathologists are faced in the routine anatomical pathology examination when faced with renal poorly differentiated neoplasm in adults.\n\n【16】Both cases had an uncanny presentation. In case number 1, the 8.3 cm kidney mass was discovered after the patient presented clinically with irradiating flank pain, mimicking the pain related with kidney stones. Moreover, it was associated with a benign ovarian tumor and the diagnosis of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING was only possible after extensive immunohistochemical and molecular studies, which were mainly performed to rule out other entities that were considered due to the unusual presentation and associated ovarian tumor. In literature-reported renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING, the clinical presentation was often nonspecific, comprising abdominal pain, palpable mass, and hematuria, and most reported cases were diagnosed incidentally by image studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–8\\]</u>. Few tumors had associated concurrent abnormalities such as hemangioma, central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and ovarian disgerminoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Our second case report was even more unusual. The Case 2 presented with respiratory problems after being involved in an automobilistic accident where multiple fractures were acquired. The clinical presentation suggested pulmonary thormboembolism, which was confirmed by image; however, after histopathological examination of the thrombectomy material small blue cell tumor of uncertain origin was regarded as the cause for the extensive thromboembolic event. Later on, a nephrectomy was performed and a renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING was diagnosed. As far as literature reports, there are few reports of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING with tumor thrombus extending to the inferior vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. However, in our case the thrombus extended all the way up to the inferior vena cava, right atrium, and bilateral pulmonary arteries, with more aggressive tumor extension than the previous reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】As far as disease progression, our cases had a better response to chemotherapy and surgery than the previous reported cases of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The outcome of other patients reported in the literature included very short survival, nonresponse to intensive therapy, and death 5 months after diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–8, 11\\]</u>. Both our cases were free of disease after one year, and long-term outcome is still awaited.\n\n【19】Renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor should be differentiated from other small blue cell tumors arising in the kidney such as blastemal predominant Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, desmoplastic small blue cell tumor, and synovial sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 12\\]</u>. All of them have very similar morphology with frequent overlapping morphological features, thus, extensive immunohistochemistry panel, in addition to the morphological features, is essential in reaching the final diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【20】CD99 was the former marker for Ewings’ sarcoma; however, it is also expressed in other tumors such as synovial sarcoma, Wilms’ tumor, vascular malignancy, neuroendocrine tumors, and lymphoblastic lymphoma, and therefore nowadays is not considered a reliable marker of tumor origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 8\\]</u>. Our presented first case showed a very weak stain for CD99, and the second one because of the bloody background was very difficult to interpret illustrating some of the difficulties in using this marker in diagnostic grounds.\n\n【21】From the neuroendocrine marker, CD56 was positive in both cases whereas synapthophysin was positive only in the second case in a cytoplasm dot pattern. This pattern has been considered as an unspecific pattern, but a recent publication described the pattern in oligodendrogliomas, and therefore the pattern seems to indicate neural origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The features favoring the diagnosis of blastemal Wilms tumor are young age and positivity of blastemal elements for vimentin, low molecular weight cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and WT1. Both cases in our study were positive for cytokeratin and vimentin. However, WT1 was negative and EWSR1 gene was identified by FISH, and therefore adult Wilms’ tumor was ruled out.\n\n【23】Renal neuroblastomas are also similar morphologically to renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor. However, they usually occur at the age of 5 years and show a fibrillary background or a ganglionic differentiation facilitating the diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry is very useful to differentiate it from renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor because neuroblastomas are consistently positive for NSE and chromogranin and mostly negative for CD99.\n\n【24】Rhabdomyosarcoma is often positive for smooth muscle actin, desmin, and myogenin; all of them were negative in our patients. Desmoplastic small blue cell tumors are also positive for desmin, and synovial sarcoma was ruled out using the FISH for the X-18 SYT translocation, which was negative.\n\n【25】Finally, lymphoblastic lymphoma could be excluded by performing analysis with LCA and other hematopoietic markers; however, in the second case the background was positive for lymphoid markers. The differential was performed by morphology of the tumor cells which had stippled chromatin and pleomorphism whereas the lymphoid cells formed a uniform monotonous population with small dark nuclei in the background.\n\n【26】In our cases, the molecular analysis identifying the translocation was a supportive and strong confirmatory tool, especially with the confusing immunohistochemical profile. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using the 22q12 LSI, EWSR1, and Dual-Color Break-Apart Probe showed the translocation pattern 22q12 for the EWSR1 gene. The probe used in our cases is from Vysis (Abbott Laboratories, Downers Grove, Ill, USA) and is commercially available, and data have been published using this probe. The probe is an EWSR1 (22; q12) Dual-Color, Break-Apart Rearrangement Probe, which consists of a mixture of 2 FISH DNA probes. The first is a 500 kb probe labeled in spectrum orange and flanks the 5 V side of EWSR1 gene and extends inward into intron 4. The second probe is 1100 kb labeled in spectrum green and flanks the 3 V side of the EWSR1 gene. There is 7-kb probe between the 2 probes. The known breakpoints within the EWSR1 gene are restricted to introns 7 through 10V. Approximately 90% of the translocations involving EWSR1 gene result in t(11; 22) translocation characteristic of EWS/PNET.\n\n【27】Because most renal primitive neuroectodermal tumors/EWING tumor of the kidney are poorly differentiated and have a broad morphological spectrum, it is important to have genetic confirmation for the presence of t(11; 22) for the accurate identification of these tumors, and the FISH probe is a good and easy method to do so.\n\n【28】In summary, we report two cases of primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor arising in the kidney confirmed by morphology, immunohistochemistry and FISH. The unusual presentation in our cases delayed the diagnosis, being both tumors diagnosed incidentally. Thus, we believe that these cases added some features to the already broad spectrum of presentations described in renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor and also showed the importance of molecular analysis together with morphological and immunohistochemical features for confirmation of this poorly differentiated neoplasm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The diagnosis is challenging due to the rarity, nonspecific symptoms, and absence of the alarmingly high blood glucose levels, and thus, it could be initially missed resulting in delayed treatment. This is particularly important for sedated patients, as the absence of typical clinical signs and symptoms can obscure the diagnosis. We present the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus on empagliflozin who developed EDKA while sedated after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) despite stopping the medication 24 hours prior to surgery. We also summarize the current literature on EDKA after CABG. Physicians must be aware and maintain a high index of suspicion for the illness, especially in patients with T2DM taking SGLT-2i and undergoing a major operation such as CABG. Emergent treatment and multidisciplinary follow-up are needed to improve patient outcomes and mitigate complications. Physicians should also consider identifying the optimal time to discontinue SGLT-2i before major surgeries and possible ketone studies in such patients, especially those sedated following the surgery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most serious complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). It is characterized by hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.3 and serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/L), and ketosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This complication typically develops in patients with type 1 DM and, to a lesser extent, type 2 DM (T2DM). It is commonly associated with stress, such as that associated with major surgery or infection. Rarely, these patients could present with a relatively lower blood glucose (BG) level (<250 mg/dL), which is referred to as “euglycemic” DKA (EDKA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although it is rare, this entity has been described in the literature. In fact, it was reported that approximately 2.6%–3.2% of all DKA admissions are euglycemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Among different associated factors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) (i.e. gliflozins) are believed to be linked to EDKA, with rates ranging from 0.16 to 0.76 events per 1000 patient-years in patients with T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. This rare variant of DKA poses a challenging diagnosis for physicians as patients with normal or near-normal BG levels may be initially overlooked resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can be fatal. EDKA related to SGLT-2i is important to consider in diabetic patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The use of SGLT-2i has become more common in this population after data suggesting a mortality benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. T2DM patients with cardiac diseases taking gliflozins are prone to experience many stressors, especially when complicated with an acute CVD event (e.g. myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbation, and cardiac surgeries), which can further increase their chances of getting gliflozin-induced EDKA. In the same context, we present a case of a T2DM patient on SGLT-2i who developed EDKA, while sedated, after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Moreover, we sought to conduct a literature search on EDKA after CABG to shed the light and attract the attention of the medical community to this rising issue.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 52-year-old male, with the past medical history significant for T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease (IHD), presented to the cardiology clinic complaining of recurrent chest pain. He has had chest pain for a long period of time, which was getting more severe one week prior to hospital admission. He denied any history of smoking, illicit drug use, or alcohol consumption. At that time, his physical examination was unremarkable. He was on vildagliptin-metformin (50/1000 mg), empagliflozin (10 mg), pioglitazone (30 mg), irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (300/12.5 mg), atorvastatin (20 mg), and aspirin; however, he was not compliant, which was associated with poorly controlled blood pressure and glucose levels. His laboratory results  were within normal limits, except for abnormal HbA1c (10.24%) and lipid profile. His ECG showed sinus tachycardia with no acute ischemic changes. Echocardiography showed an ejection fraction (EF) of >50% with no wall motion abnormalities. CT coronaries showed 70% stenosis at the left main coronary artery. Due to these findings, the patient was advised to undergo diagnostic coronary angiography which revealed triple vessel disease. After thorough discussion between the patient, cardiology, and cardiac surgery physicians, the decision was made to operate on the patient with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Owing to his critical lesions, the patient was admitted and closely monitored until the day of surgery. At that time, he was started on insulin sliding scale. Additionally, metformin-vildagliptin was held before coronary angiography, while the other medications, including empagliflozin, were continued until 24 hours prior to the surgery. His laboratory results were normal , except for high fasting glucose. He was fasting for a total of 8 hours before the surgery.\n\n【7】Table 1 Blood tests of our patient at 5 different occasions.\n\n【8】The patient underwent grafting of the diseased vessels. The patient tolerated the surgery well, came off the cardiopulmonary bypass without difficulties, and did not need inotropic support. He was shifted to the ICU in a stable condition. On the same day, the patient was sedated on mechanical ventilation. Initially, he was clinically and vitally stable on minimal noradrenaline dose with no oozing from drain sites. Six hours after leaving the OR, his arterial blood gases (ABG) showed anion gap metabolic acidosis, with high lactate (3.3 mmol/L), that was resistant to IV fluid boluses. At that time, although his random blood glucose measures were ranging between 145 and 188 mg/dL, he had a blood pH of 7.225, with markedly decreased HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> (14.60 mmol/L) and an anion gap of 17.40, consistent with moderate DKA. Urinalysis showed 3+ ketones . Therefore, the decision was made to follow the DKA protocol for management in addition to closely monitoring his electrolytes and blood glucose levels. As soon as DKA was detected, he was started on IV fluids and insulin infusion. For fluids, he was given 1000 cc bolus of Ringer’s Lactate followed by ½ Normal Saline (NS) at a rate of 150 cc/hour for one hour. Then, the patient was transitioned to Dextrose 5% ½ NS (150 cc/hour). After a few hours, the rate was decreased to 100 cc/hour. The next day, he was transitioned to 0.9% NS (70 cc/hour). The patient was kept on insulin for 12 hours from the time of EDKA diagnosis. Hours after treatment, the patient began to improve . His pH normalized, and his K+ level went down to 3.7 mmol/L. Urine ketones went from 3+ to 1+.\n\n【9】Table 2 ABG and urinalysis of our patient at 4 different occasions.\n\n【10】On the following day, the patient was awake and oriented. He did not have any active complaints. He was clinically and vitally stable. He received two units of packed RBCs due to his low hemoglobin (7.40 g/dL). His ABG normalized with a blood pH of 7.418, K+ of 3.90 mmol/L and an HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> level of 23.3 mmol/L. At that time, his urinalysis was negative for ketone bodies. The next day, the patient was shifted to the cardiology floor with improving overall health status and hemoglobin level. He has had an uneventful hospital course for 8 days during which he was steadily improving. Subsequently, the patient was discharged home in a stable condition with appropriate follow-up appointments.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】The diagnosis of EDKA is challenging for several reasons. The fact that EDKA is rare, and more so in patients with T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, the nonspecific symptoms of the illness, and the absence of alarmingly high BG levels (i.e. >250) are all contributing factors that allow the diagnosis to be easily missed. The rarity of such an illness could be due to underdiagnosis, underreporting, and more likely, due to true rarity in occurrence. The recent possible role that SGLT-2i may play in the development of EDKA has encouraged physicians and researchers alike to uncover novel information regarding the incidence and underlying mechanism of the illness associated with these agents.\n\n【13】SGLT-2i are a new class of antidiabetic medications that lower BG levels by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules. It is suggested that SGLT-2i can lead to EDKA by decreasing BG levels, which leads to a reduction in insulin secretion and consequent rise in glucagon. In addition, SGLT-2i can directly stimulate glucagon production. As a result of low insulin and high glucagon levels, ketogenesis will be activated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. One study estimates a 7-fold increase in DKA in patients with T2DM due to SGLT-2 inhibitor use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, not all of these cases were euglycemic.\n\n【14】SGLT-2i have demonstrated cardioprotective effects and reduction in cardiovascular negative outcomes making them an excellent choice for patients with diabetes and CVD, such as our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The benefits of SGLT-2i in such patients must be outweighed against the risks of adverse effects, especially in times of stress (i.e. CABG), and the current recommendations suggest the omission of SGLT-2i dose one day before surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Nevertheless, there have been cases described of perioperative EDKA in patients who have had these medications omitted for up to 48 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In accordance with the current recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, empagliflozin was omitted 24 hours before our patient’s surgery, yet he still developed EDKA postoperatively. The time since the medication is held prior to surgery is an important factor to consider, due to two main reasons: the absence of the offending agent (i.e. gliflozin use) and the patient being put on insulin. Being on insulin for a greater period of time (e.g. >48 hours) is theoretically expected to decrease the chances of gliflozin-induced EDKA. The suggested hypothesis is related to low blood insulin levels and resultant switch of glucose to fat metabolism and subsequent development of ketosis and ketoacidosis. This is of important relevance in patients taking SGLT-2i, as they were most likely put on the medication due to its positive glycemic and cardioprotective effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Moreover, the fasting state prior to surgery presents its own added risk to developing EDKA, perhaps due to increased ketogenesis during periods of starvation, adding another factor that can possibly lead to, or exacerbate, this patient’s condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In addition to highlighting the relationship between the offending agent (SGLT-2i) and the population at risk, it is worth focusing on the parts of the story that made the diagnosis challenging. In our case, the diagnosis of EDKA was not easy since the patient was sedated after CABG; thus, the common clinical presentation of DKA (abdominal pain, polyuria, excessive thirst, nausea, and vomiting) could not be appreciated, unlike other cases wherein patients were awake, oriented, and had typical symptoms of DKA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 12\\]</u>. Additionally, his blood glucose levels postoperatively were well below 200 mg/dL; thus, it could have discouraged the caring physician to initiate continuous insulin infusion, which is the usual practice in most of the critically-ill or post-major surgery patients with diabetes. The ABG that showed anion gap metabolic acidosis that is resistant to IV fluids prompted further workup, wherein ketonuria was detected. Supplementary Figure 1 represents the connection between T2DM, SGLT-2I, and major stressors with EDKA development.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Review of the Literature\n\n【17】To better evaluate EDKA after CABG, we performed a literature search on PubMed (19 April 2021) using the following search string: ((Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis) AND (coronary artery bypass surgery)) without time restrictions, in addition to carefully assessing the references of certain EDKA articles for possible matches. Out of 67 PubMed articles, 5 articles were retrieved that reported on a total of 7 patients and were published between 2018 and 2021. Table 3 summarizes the reported cases of EDKA after CABG in the literature. Interestingly, our search string did not include any keywords related to SGLT-2i; however, all the retrieved articles had SGLT-2i use in common. The time since gliflozin was held preoperatively was reported to be within 1 day prior to surgery in most of the cases; however, it was still possible for patients to develop EDKA when withholding the medication was carried out 42 and 48 hours before CABG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 16\\]</u>. Moreover, most of the patients showed some signs and symptoms that usually accompany DKA, unlike our patient. Serum lactate was normal in the majority of cases, and even the patients who have had high serum lactate (e.g. 2.24, 2.8) did not reach to a clear cutoff level that is equivalent to lactic acidosis (serum lactate >5.0 mmol/L) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Moreover, the time between CABG and EDKA development can extend up to a few days, as Zhand and Tamilia reported about their patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Of note, one article reported on a patient with EDKA after CABG who was on SGLT-2i that was held for >24 hours prior to surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>; however, this article was not included in our table since it is in Japanese and, thus, could not be thoroughly analyzed.\n\n【18】Table 3 Reported cases of EDKA after CABG.\n\n【19】Based on the current evidence, physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for EDKA when dealing with cardiac patients on SGLT-2i, especially when these patients are to experience periods of excessive stress. This may be due to the absence of the easy and quick screening measure of typical hyperglycemia and the absence of clinical symptoms, especially in sedated patients. Patients with EDKA need immediate referral for emergency evaluation and management. The treatment includes addressing the underlying etiology, correction of dehydration with intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and the use of insulin and dextrose infusions until the anion gap and bicarbonate levels normalize 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The correct diagnosis in our patient was made mainly through laboratory investigations; prompt EDKA treatment protocol ensued that resulted in improvement of our patient’s clinical status and outcome.\n\n【20】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【21】Patients with T2DM and CVD are recommended to be on SGLT-2i due to their positive CV benefits; however, these patients may also be considered having a higher risk for developing EDKA following an acute cardiac or other stressful event. Our case does not underestimate the importance of SGLT-2i use in cases where they are clearly indicated, but rather, it shows a potential side effect that can be avoided.\n\n【22】In conclusion, physicians should be aware and maintain a high index of suspicion for EDKA in patients taking SGLT-2i that have recently experienced high levels of stress (i.e. CABG). The diagnosis is challenging due to the rarity, nonspecific symptoms, and absence of high BG levels. Moreover, it is more challenging to make the diagnosis in sedated patients as the typical clinical presentation may be masked. Emergent treatment and multidisciplinary follow-up are needed to improve patient outcomes and mitigate complications. More studies on bigger scales are required to better understand the prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of this condition. Future guidelines should consider identifying the optimal time to discontinue SGLT-2i prior to a major surgery. In addition, we suggest routine urine ketone check in patients on SGLT-2i after CABG due to the seriousness of this condition, and the cost effectiveness of urine ketones makes them an excellent choice as a possible screening tool for such patients. An effort within the medical community must be put forth in future studies to merge and review similar cases to uncover more information that will help guide clinicians in EDKA prevention, detection, and treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "33d157df-0eff-4db4-9a4d-0c0ae43d73b1", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】This study presents the clinical and electrophysiological findings of four subjects with a pathogenic heterozygous GDAP1 variant causing Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease 2K (CMT2K) and one additional subject with an uncertain GDAP1 variant and clinical findings of CMT 2K. The study evaluated these five subjects using clinical, laboratory, electrophysiological, and genetic testing. The findings showed that clinical features demonstrated no pes cavus, no significant weakness in the hands or feet, normal reflexes in four out of the five subjects, and mild to normal electrodiagnostic findings. The variant was associated with painful and numb feet with diminished sensation to pinprick. This study suggests that GDAP1 variants may be associated with very mild, predominantly sensory Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, warranting continuing research for this type of the disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) reflects a group of inherited neuropathies affecting 1 in 2,500 individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. CMT type 1A is the most common CMT, accounting for approximately 60% of those with a genetic diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Classically, CMT is characterized by distal weakness, foot structural deformities, sensory abnormalities, areflexia, and abnormalities in gait 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Genetic advances have allowed the classic CMT phenotype to be expanded and evaluated for idiopathic unexplained neuropathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The rare forms of CMT still need to be understood. This study aims to elucidate our understanding of the clinical features of heterozygous GDAP1 mutations.\n\n【5】GDAP1 mutations can present in both heterozygous and homozygous forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. GDAP1 mutations are responsible for demyelinating intermediate and axonal recessive CMT and CMT 2K, a rare dominant axonal CMT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7–10\\]</u>. The majority of GDAP1 mutations are biallelic giving rise to autosomal recessive CMT, which can present as either demyelinating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, axonal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, or intermediate CMT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Although the homozygous presentation is typically very severe with early childhood onset with motor and sensory involvement and possible vocal fold paresis, the heterozygous form seems much less severe with a late-onset mild sensory presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【7】This study further describes the clinical presentation of GDAP1 mutations and adds to the knowledge of heterozygous GDAP1 mutations.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Methods\n\n【9】All subjects received care at the AdventHealth Orlando Neuroscience Institute. All had neurological records evaluated. In addition, four out of the five individuals had electrodiagnostic testing performed. Genetic testing for inherited neuropathies was performed through Invitae (San Francisco, CA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Three pathogenic variants in the GDAP1 gene were identified, and one variant of uncertain significance in the GDAP1 gene was also detected.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【11】Case 1. As a child, this subject had no difficulties with running, walking, roller skating, or biking. She was not athletic and was the slowest runner compared to her peers at school but was healthy and active. Her symptoms first started in her 50s when she started to have difficulty with fatigue and numbness in her toes. Occasionally, she will have pain. She has no weakness but does have some difficulty with climbing stairs. Her son was diagnosed with CMT at age 10 due to high arches, which prompted her evaluation for CMT.\n\n【12】Case 2. In her youth, she had no difficulties with running, walking, balance, or athletics. She was a slow runner in general and had weak ankles. Her symptoms started in her 20s when she experienced burning foot pain after standing for prolonged periods. In her 40s, she felt that she started to develop numbness in her feet and mild difficulty with dexterity in her hands. Examination revealed absent Achilles reflexes.\n\n【13】Case 3. As a child, she had no difficulties with running, walking, roller skating, or biking. Although she was not athletic, she was a fast walker. She had some mild tremors throughout her life. She developed burning, tingling, and extreme sensitivity to cold at age 67. She has numbness in her thumbs and paresthesias in her hands and feet. Neurological examination is intact except for absent Achilles reflexes. Both her father and her daughter have CMT 2K.\n\n【14】Case 4. Daughter of the Case 3 proband: as a child, she was athletic and the fastest runner compared to her peers in school. She had cramps and growing pains but no other symptoms; she has normal foot structure. Then, in her 40s, she developed numbness in her left toes and obtained genetic testing due to her mother’s CMT diagnosis.\n\n【15】Case 5. As a child, he was athletic. In his early 50s, he started to develop constant daily pain in both plantar aspects of his feet below the middle toe area. He also has a numb feeling as if someone wrapped duct tape around his foot. Despite pain relieving interventions, including neurontin, pregabalin, marijuana, and acupuncture, he has not had pain relief. He has difficulty walking due to his balance. He had a ruptured Achilles tendon. He walks and rides his bike daily. EMG/NCS showed minor abnormalities to suggest a possible sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Exam is significant only for absent ankle jerk reflexes and pinprick sensation decreased up to ankle.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【17】CMT can have various symptoms and signs, including mild paresthesias, as evidenced in this study. In some cases, genetic testing can reveal underlying causes of idiopathic mild neuropathies.\n\n【18】The findings from the subjects with a heterozygous pathogenic GDAP1 missense variant  demonstrate that all presented with a mild sensory neuropathy; all except one subject had a late-onset neuropathy developing after age 40. Electrodiagnostic testing was normal in one of the five individuals, with the other two individuals having minor nerve conduction abnormalities. Neurological exam was normal except for decreased pinprick in proband 1, absent reflexes in proband 2, and absent Achilles reflex in proband 3. There was no family history in proband 2. Proband 1 had a son with high arches in his feet at age 10. Proband 3 has a daughter with numbness in her left toe and a father who had a neuropathy. Proband 5 developed pain in his feet in his 50s.\n\n【19】Table 1 Clinical Results of individuals with a heterozygous GDAP1 missense variant.\n\n【20】Previous studies of heterozygous GDAP1 variants suggest a late-onset, slowly progressive, and mild neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9\\]</u>.

Zimon et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u> also reported heterozygous GDAP1 variants with various age onset, but unlike our study, some subjects presented with walking difficulties. However, similar to our study, some subjects were asymptomatic, perhaps due to incomplete penetrance or the nature of the heterozygous form.

We report a case of pyometra detected on second-look surgery in an elderly patient with life-threatening septic shock and cardiopulmonary arrest before hospital arrival. Case Presentation. A 70-year-old woman with cardiopulmonary arrest received adrenaline. Computed tomography revealed ascites, and abdominal paracentesis was performed to identify the cause of cardiopulmonary arrest. The ascitic fluid was purulent, and intraperitoneal infection was identified. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed pyometra. Conclusion. If perforated, pyometra may cause peritonitis and lethal septic shock. Not only gynecologists but also emergency physicians should be aware of this possibility. Moreover, patient education is necessary. In patients with cardiopulmonary arrest, diagnostic abdominal paracentesis should be performed when the sole imaging finding is ascites. Improving outcomes in patients with difficult-to-diagnose pyometra with cardiopulmonary arrest by implementing damage control strategies before hysterectomy is possible.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pyometra is a rare condition characterized by pus accumulation due to a bacterial infection in the uterine cavity. It is caused by impaired drainage of the uterine cavity, usually due to stenosis and obstruction of the cervix and vagina. Spontaneous perforation in pyometra is rare, and its consequences are often severe, with a mortality rate of 25%–40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Additionally, 50% of imperforate pyometra cases are asymptomatic, which complicates the issue and makes it difficult to ensure survival of these patients.\n\n【4】Pyometra should be considered when patients present with the “classic triad of purulent vaginal discharge, postmenopausal bleeding, and lower abdominal pain” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Physical findings, including fever and an abdominal mass, are often observed in patients with pyometra; however, some patients experience cardiopulmonary arrest in the absence of these.\n\n【5】A high index of suspicion is required to make an early diagnosis and provide early intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Management options include total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, antibiotics targeting anaerobic organisms, and intensive care unit admission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>. There have been no reports on treatment strategies after resuscitation in cases where findings could not be confirmed after cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n【6】We present a case of damage control management of perforating pyometra after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in an elderly woman presenting with septic shock. Intraperitoneal infection was diagnosed by ascites puncture, and she underwent damage control surgery.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 70-year-old woman with a history of uterine fibroids was looking for an emergency hospital with a chief complaint of dysarthria, when an acquaintance found her collapsed. She could barely speak when found, and upon arrival at emergency services by ambulance, she was in cardiopulmonary arrest. Her electrocardiogram waveform showed a pulseless electrical activity. She had not received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and ambulance crews started CPR upon arrival on the scene. After the administration of 1 mg adrenaline in the ambulance, the patient’s heartbeat resumed. Thirteen minutes passed from the confirmation of cardiac arrest (at arrival at emergency services) to the ROSC. Her bilateral pupil diameter was 4 mm, but spontaneous breathing soon resumed.\n\n【9】On arrival, her vital signs were as follows: heart rate, 72 beats/min; blood pressure, 79/35 mmHg; and body temperature, 30.8°C. Assessment of her level of consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Scale revealed eye response of 1, verbal response of 1, and motor response of 1 (E1V1M1), but the bilateral pupil diameter had reduced to 3 mm. Blood gas analysis revealed pH of 6.909, PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 80.8 mmHg, PaO<sub>2</sub> of 67.9 mmHg, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> level of 17.5 mmol/L, and lactate level of 7.0 mmol/L. On abdominal computed tomography (CT) , we observed ascites accumulation and fluid-containing uterine fibroids of approximately 10 cm in size.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Plain computed tomography (CT) on admission showing ascites accumulation and fluid-containing uterine fibroids.</u>\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 shows the patient’s clinical course, and Figure 3 shows her laboratory data after admission. We could not identify the cause of cardiopulmonary arrest; thus, the nature of the ascites detected on CT was assessed. Puncture revealed the ascites to be purulent. We suspected septic shock due to an intraperitoneal infection and decided to perform emergency laparotomy, when a large volume of purulent ascites flowed out. Based on intra-abdominal findings, we speculated that some organs in the pelvis might have been infected, but we could not find the origin in the first-look surgery.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Clinical course after admission.

Inflammatory parameters, renal function, and clotting ability of blood were generally stable within a week. DCS, damage control surgery; WBC, white blood cell; Plt, platelet; CRP, C-reactive protein.</u>\n\n【14】As a damage control strategy, we only performed open abdominal drainage and did not remove the uterus. For temporary abdominal closure, we used open abdomen management (OAM) using the VAC® system (KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA), with polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX®-DHP, Toray, Tokyo, Japan) immediately after surgery to stabilize the patient’s circulatory dynamics.\n\n【15】Twelve hours after the patient’s circulatory dynamics stabilized, we performed second-look surgery and again washed out the intra-abdominal cavity. On re-examining the uterus, we found a pore of approximately 1 cm at the top of the fibroid on the dorsal side and continuous discharge of pus. We judged the cause to be sepsis and immediately removed the uterus, with gauze packing to control oozing from the bottom of the pelvis. The small intestine was ischemic; hence, we again performed OAM for temporary abdominal closure .\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Operative findings on second-look surgery, with a pale small intestine, indicating that it might become ischemic (circle).</u>\n\n【17】We closed the abdomen on day 5 after the first damage control surgery. The patient’s vital signs stabilized, and her inflammatory parameters improved and, finally, so did her level of consciousness.\n\n【18】Pathological findings  included a fibroma with abscess formation, peritonitis, adenomyosis, endometrial polyp, and endometrial stromal nodule of the uterine corpus. Examination of the uterus for pyometra revealed yellowish fragile areas with necrosis or abscess formation 删除1:<u>(Figures 5(a) and 5(b))</u>. No malignancy was identified on histological examination 删除1:<u>(Figure 5(c))</u>, suggesting a fibroma with inflammatory cell infiltration. Both blood and ascites cultures were positive for Peptostreptococcus micros, an anaerobic bacterium.\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Pathological findings. (a) Appearance of pyometra. (b) A solid white mass of approximately 10 cm in size, and yellowish fragile areas with necrosis or abscess formation in the mass (circles). (c) Histologically, there was no obvious malignancy. There were few positive findings of smooth muscle markers (SMA, Caldesmon) using immunostaining. Deposition of collagen fiber bundles was relatively prominent in the stroma, and a flower bud-like array was recognized. These findings suggested that this mass was a fibroma rather than a leiomyoma. An abscess with massive neutrophil infiltration was present in the mass, and the surrounding serosal surface showed inflammatory cell infiltration with fibrin deposition. (d) A large mass of Gram-positive bacteria (arrowheads) was found inside the abscess.</u>\n\n【20】Soon after, the patient developed urinary tract infection due to right ureteral calculi, and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was performed. On day 146, she was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation for hypoxic encephalopathy.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】Pyometra may cause peritonitis and lethal septic shock if intraperitoneal perforation occurs. Causes of pyometra include malignant or benign gynecologic tumors, radiation cervicitis, atrophic cervicitis with aging, and intrauterine devices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. In our patient, pyometra was due to her history of uterine fibroids, which are among the commonest tumors in women, most being followed up.\n\n【23】An aging population suggests that cases of pyometra will increase. Pyometra is usually a chronic disease with a good prognosis, but sometimes it may burst into the peritoneal cavity. In such cases, it may cause generalized peritonitis and has a poor prognosis. Because of the nonspecific symptoms associated with rupture, an accurate diagnosis is often challenging. This can cause a delay in identifying the source of infection, which results in delayed removal of the infection source.\n\n【24】Therefore, not only gynecologists but also emergency physicians should be aware that the perforation of pyometra can be a cause of abdominal pain in elderly women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However, it is also necessary to educate patients about uterine fibroids and about the fact that, in rare cases, they may develop infections that could prove fatal.\n\n【25】As in our case, pyometra is often diagnosed based on findings, including fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal mass. In contrast, there is a report on a patient in whom pyometra could not be confirmed from findings, including those after resuscitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A common treatment for pyometra is transvaginal uterine washing; however, in the case of perforation, intraperitoneal irrigation drainage by laparotomy, total hysterectomy, and superior uterotomy are preferred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【26】A report has suggested that removal of uterine necrosis, closure of the perforation, and transabdominal uterine drainage without total uterine removal can save the patient’s life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, but, in most previous cases, total hysterectomy has been selected because of its better outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Currently, no standard treatment strategy has been reported, and there are no clear criteria to select a damage control strategy for atraumatic patients. However, in the most severe instances, the patient may benefit from a damage control strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In our case, we were unaware of the fact that her primary care doctor had previously detected a pyometra. It took over 10 minutes to resuscitate the patient; thus, we thought that it would be difficult to save her life, especially that her hemodynamics on arrival were unstable. Therefore, we judged that open abdominal drainage was sufficient for source control.\n\n【27】We suggest that if even a slight improvement in the neurological prognosis is anticipated—similar to that observed in our patient—aggressive treatment, including searching for the cause and surgery, should be considered. Abdominal echography or CT should be performed to identify the cause, followed by ascites puncture when ascites is confirmed. If ascites puncture identifies an intraperitoneal infection, abscess drainage by opening is a reasonable strategy for source control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> and can be performed as a damage control surgery.\n\n【28】Spending time searching for the cause of the intraperitoneal infection after resuscitation and continuing with primary curative surgery will likely result in failure of circulatory dynamics. After stabilizing the patient’s circulatory dynamics in the intensive care unit, it is possible to identify the cause by examining the intra-abdominal cavity in second-look surgery. Our patient survived because of hysterectomy performed to treat pyometra, which was determined to be the cause of the life-threatening septic shock at second-look surgery. If a damage control strategy is undertaken, as reported here, outcomes of patients with difficult-to-diagnose pyometra who experience cardiopulmonary arrest may improve.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Most of the cases reported are in females, while only a few are reported in males.

Introduction\n\n【3】A 59-year-old male patient was referred to the breast clinic with a breast lump underneath the right nipple. The lump was painless with no other associated complaints. On clinical assessment it was a firm, discrete benign feeling lesion, about 15 mm in diameter. There were no palpable axillary lymph nodes. On radiological assessment, both Ultrasound scan and Mammography showed a benign looking mass just lateral to the right nipple, with discrete well-defined edges . This measured 18 mm  ×  13 mm on ultrasound scan.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Mammography: Right breast CC & MLO Views: Isodense, well-defined lesion within the retroareolar area 1 8 × 1 3  mm in diameter. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【5】The patient refused to have a core biopsy, therefore, an excisional biopsy was done under local anaesthesia. Histopathology showed a 20 mm spindle cell tumour with pleomorphism and mitoses . On Immunohistochemistry, the lesion was positive for Desmin and Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) while it was negative for S100. All these were in keeping with primary leiomyosarcoma. The nearest margin was the superficial which was 4 mm from the tumour. Staging investigations were normal. Simple mastectomy without axillary dissection was performed and a residual disease was confirmed. The cavity wall confirmed the presence of a further 5 mm of similar tumour. A multidisciplinary team decision postoperatively was to keep the patient under regular followup with no need of any further adjuvant therapy.

Discussion\n\n【8】Sarcomas comprise less than 1% of all primary breast neoplasms and only a minority of these are leiomyosarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Sarcomas in the breast have been described since the early 20th century but most probably the first confirmed case of leiomyosarcoma on IHC was reported in the late 1960s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Though it was described as fibrosarcoma in the report, Munitiz et al. commented in 2004 that the pathological features on optical and electronic microscopy were in keeping with Leiomyosarcoma. It has been reported that only 25 cases in the literature are confirmed primary leiomyosarcomas of the breast proven on IHC or electron microscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Confirming the diagnosis on either IHC or electron microscopy is important as it is sometimes difficult to differentiate these pathologically from poorly differentiated sarcomatoid carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Diagnosis can be challenging because of the nonspecific clinical and radiological findings. Clinically they present with a progressively enlarging tumour. The presence of enlarged axillary nodes is rare making axillary node staging unnecessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. Radiological findings are also non specific. While some have reported a welldefined lesion that can be mistaken for benign pathology as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, others have reported malignant looking lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Fine needle aspiration cytology can be challenging as these tumours can be mistaken for poorly differentiated carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma, or other sarcomas such as malignant phylloides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. On histopathological assessment, Immunohistochemical staining is essential as adjuncts to differentiate leiomyosarcomas from other tumours and soft tissue sarcomas. These tumours are usually positive for desmin, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin and negative for S100 (neural tumour marker), cytokeratins, and epithelial markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【10】The cornerstone of treatment is surgical excision. Most authors advice either radical or simple mastectomy arguing that wide excision is associated with higher rate of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 7, 9\\]</u>. Conservative surgery with wide local excision and clear margins has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10, 11\\]</u>. Though axillary node dissection is not necessary, it has been performed in many of the reported cases because of uncertain preoperative diagnosis or if there were clinically palpable nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 10, 12\\]</u>. Long-term followup is important as some of these tumours have been reported to recur more than 10 years posttreatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In summary, this tumour is a rare tumour that can be a diagnostic challenge to clinicians as it has no specific clinical or radiological features. This emphasizes the importance of triple assessment in all breast lumps, even if clinically and radiologically they are benign. The mainstay of treatment is surgical excision with clear margins and longterm followup is essential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

To our knowledge, searching both English and Japanese literature, only thirty-three cases including our case have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>.

Here we report a new case of spermatic cord lymphoma, which was found in stage IV disease. We also review literature and discuss treatment options.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】In July 2010, a 62-year-old man visited an urologist with a complaint of a left intrascrotal mass and was placed under clinical observation without treatment. Two months later, a swelling of the right tonsil appeared, and he visited an otorhinolaryngologist. After a biopsy of the right tonsil, he was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and was admitted to our hospital. Physical examination showed that the right tonsil swelled up beyond the midline, right cervical and left supraclavian lymph nodes were palpable, and a 50-mm mass existed along the left spermatic cord. He also had night sweats. In the blood examination, high levels of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor were detected (5290 U/mL). Ultrasonography showed a 50 mm tumorous lesion in maximum diameter in the left spermatic cord and a 5 mm mass in the right spermatic cord, respectively. Computed tomographic scan (CT) showed the swelling of the right tonsil and the enlargement of right cervical, left supraclavian, and para-aortic lymph nodes. 67 Ga scintigraphy showed intense uptake in the same lesions which were detected in CT, but no uptake in groins . Bone marrow aspiration showed a few large atypical cells that were positive for CD20 and negative for CD3, which suggests the invasion of lymphoma to the bone marrow. Based on these findings, he was clinically diagnosed as DLBCL at stage IVB (Ann Arbor Staging). In December 2010, he underwent left radical orchiectomy for confirming the diagnosis and mass reduction. Macroscopically, a white 67 mm tumor in maximum diameter existed around the left spermatic cord, but the testis and the epididymis were not involved . It consisted of proliferative large atypical lymphocytes . Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor cells were positive for CD20 and negative for CD3. Histopathological diagnosis was DLBCL of the left spermatic cord. As adjuvant therapy, he completed both 6 cycles of rituximab added to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) and 4 cycles of intrathecal methotrexate (IT-MTX) for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. Then, he also underwent radiotherapy (RT) to the right testis for prophylaxis of contralateral testicular relapse. CT performed 4 months after the orchiectomy showed that all lesions either disappeared or reduced, and that there was no new lesions.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Computed tomographic scan (CT) showing the swelling of the right tonsil and the enlargement of right cervical, left supraclavian, and para-aortic lymph nodes. 67 Ga scintigraphy showing intense uptake in the same lesions which were detected in CT. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Gross appearance of the surgical specimen showing a white 67 mm tumor around the left spermatic cord. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Microscopic features of the tumor consisting of proliferative large atypical lymphocytes. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Male gonadal involvement is relatively uncommon in malignant lymphoma. Of these lymphomas, testicular lymphoma is the most frequent, accounting about 1% of all nonHodgkin’s lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. On the other hand, spermatic cord lymphoma is very rare, and to the best of our knowledge, only thirty-three cases including our own case have been reported  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>. The patients ranged in age from 20 to 89 years (mean age, 60-year-old). Middle-aged men (14 out of 33 cases) and older men (15 out of 33 cases) were mainly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Most cases were stage I disease at the time of diagnosis (stage I, 21 cases; stage II, 6 cases; stage III, 2 cases; stage IV, 4 cases), nevertheless, they apparently have a poor prognosis (median survival, 12.2 months). Our case was already in stage IV at presentation. In general, it is difficult to detect the primary site when a patient with malignant lymphoma has multiple lesions. However, the first manifestation of our case was the spermatic cord tumor. Spermatic cord lymphoma has a tendency to spread or relapse towards para-aortic lymph nodes, while lymphomas derived from different primary lesions hardly metastasize to a spermatic cord in an early stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore, we assumed the primary site in our case might be the spermatic cord. Histologically reviewing, intermediate-grade lymphomas (Working Formulation), centroblast or centroblastic-centrocytic lymphomas (Kiel classification), and DLBCL (WHO classification) were most frequently observed, except two cases which suffered from Burkitt’s subtype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. All cases that the immunophenotypical study was performed showed a B-cell phenotype.\n\n【11】Table 1 Reported cases of spermatic cord lymphoma.\n\n【12】It is said that spermatic cord lymphoma is clinicopathologically similar to primary testicular lymphoma (PTL). PTL is a potentially fatal disease second only to primary brain lymphoma; median survival is between 12 and 24 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It is due to failures in contralateral testis, CNS, and extranodal sites. Recently, an international phase II trial showed that the recommended first-line treatment for stage I or II PTL is orchiectomy followed by R-CHOP, IT-MTX, and RT to the contralateral testis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the same way, it has been said that multidisciplinary treatments should be given in early staged spermatic cord lymphoma, but actually was not. Reviewing reported cases of stage I spermatic cord lymphoma, the initial treatment was only orchiectomy with or without RT by the 1980s, and the ratio of combining chemotherapy or not has become half and half since the 1990s. No case except ours underwent IT-MTX. Median survival of stage I spermatic cord lymphoma treated only orchiectomy with or without RT was 18.2 months, while 5-year overall survival rates of early staged PTL treated multidisciplinarily were 85% in the recent trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. It suggests that combined treatment with R-CHOP, IT-MTX, and RT to the contralateral testis will attribute a better outcome in early staged spermatic cord lymphoma.\n\n【13】On the other hand, the treatment of choice for stage III or IV disease in spermatic cord lymphoma still remains to be determined. For advanced PTL, the recommended first-line treatment is R-CHOP, however a median survival of less than six months is reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Despite a higher rate of relapse in the contralateral testis (up to 50% of patients), RT to the contralateral testis is recommended by some authors, while others propose RT only for symptomatic patients or in the case of bulky disease. IT-MTX to prevent CNS relapse, which occurs in approximately 50% of patients, is also considered in patients achieving complete remission.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Discussion\n\n【14】According to the Paris classification of superficial neoplastic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, lesions with sm invasion of less than 1000  m from the muscularis mucosae should be removed by ESD. In contrast, lesions with sm invasion exceeding 1000  m are currently considered for surgical resection, as shown in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. In this particular case, due to the patient’s critical heart condition, ESD was performed although the sm invasion exceeded 1000  m in depth, and the nonlifting sign was positive.\n\n【15】At the National Cancer Center Hospital a total of 16 cases with deep invasive sm lesions have been successfully removed by ESD, with negative lateral and vertical margins observed during histopathological analysis of the resected specimen.\n\n【16】During ESD for sm cancer, a direct observation of the sm and muscle layers possibilitates a total sm resection. If the lesion has invaded the muscularis propria though, ESD should not be performed because of the risk of colonic perforation. However, as discussed by Saito 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, the use of the B-knife in ESD has decreased the perforation rate. By using this device, a safer procedure is achieved probably because the electric current is centered to the tip of the needle, as shown in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【17】This case has demonstrated that the removal of lesions with sm invasion greater than 1000  m from the muscularis mucosae can be successfully resected by ESD as a local resection. It is our belief that this procedure should become the treatment of choice for deep invasive sm cancer at least in patients at high risk for surgical intervention, which would avoid the risk of a surgical procedure and would improve the patient’s quality of life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

On February 2, 2020, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that the public health emergency justified the development and emergency use of “in vitro diagnostics for the detection and/or diagnosis of the virus that causes COVID-19” by activating the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Unfortunately, effective mitigation efforts were thwarted early in the outbreak resulting in an expansion of the initial EUA on February 29, 2020, to improve accessibility to in vitro diagnostic testing. Expectantly, the development and deployment of SARS-CoV-2 testing including RT-PCR expanded rapidly in the weeks following the EUA expansion. These newly developed and approved SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests boast impressive positive and negative agreement rates nearing 100%. Despite the exceptionally high rates of agreement, caution is advised as the RT-PCR tests approved under the COVID-19 EUA are in vitro analyses developed with samples artificially doped with SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These tests therefore do not have clinically applicable sensitivity and specificity because they lack a “gold standard” for diagnosis. Here we present three challenging cases requiring cautious interpretation of the newest generation of RT-PCR molecular detection assays, highlighting the major challenges faced by providers treating patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In an unprecedented world of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a medley of non-FDA-approved tests has been thrust upon providers who are now challenged with their complex and potentially inconsistent interpretation. We aim to lay an intellectual framework for the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing via EUA FDA “authorized” studies and emphasize the limitations of rapid bedside interpretation. Paramount to this topic is the often misquoted “sensitivity and specificity” of the RT-PCR detection assays, a nonexistent test property for SARS-CoV-2 due to the lack of a gold standard for verification and validation. It is important for all providers to understand these constraints and the potentially misleading test results in the clinical context of their patients. This article brings forth the potential for misinformation and misinterpretation that could lead to undesired patient outcomes. We advocate a thorough assessment of a patient’s clinical picture without isolated interpretation of RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2. In an effort to guide clinicians through this unparalleled time, we present three case reports to support detailed and individualized interpretations of patient presentations in the context of both positive and negative RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2. We hope a deeper understanding of testing validation, and results will improve our medical communities’ ability to make a true diagnosis of clinically significant COVID-19 disease or lack thereof and open up future research of more validated tests.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case 1\n\n【5】The following case is of an elderly male who presented with metabolic encephalopathy and failure to thrive that was found to have persistently positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 over several weeks despite a lack of symptoms typically attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【6】A 90-year-old male with hypertension (HTN), well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), hyperlipidemia (HLD), coronary artery disease, mild Alzheimer’s dementia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 presented to the emergency department (ED) with generalized weakness and recurrent falls for the past few days. He was diagnosed with a possible urinary tract infection owing to an otherwise negative workup including a computed tomography (CT) head and chest radiograph (CXR). He did not initially undergo a NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission due to restrictions on testing at that time. He was discharged from the ED with oral antibiotics to his assisted living facility (ALF). Four days later, he returned to the ED with encephalopathy, progressive generalized weakness, and inadequate oral intake requiring admission to the inpatient medical ward. To note: the day after admission, the patient’s ALF reported an infection at their facility; however, our patient did not undergo a NP RT-PCR at that time as he had no indication for testing consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) testing algorithm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> (note: testing criteria have since been updated). Pertinent findings on presentation included a dry oropharynx, right lower lobe crackles, ecchymosis on lower extremities, and a significant encephalopathy. Initial workup revealed a serum creatinine of 2.46 (baseline 1.8), a procalcitonin of 0.16, and a normal CXR. He was diagnosed with failure to thrive, metabolic encephalopathy, and acute kidney injury (AKI) on CKD stage 3. He was initially treated with isotonic saline for volume repletion and general supportive care. On hospital day (HD) four, the patient’s metabolic encephalopathy persisted despite rehydration and resolution of his AKI warranting further investigation. Aside from a CRP of 57.4, his lab work, blood cultures, repeat procalcitonin (0.19), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, repeated CXR, and electroencephalogram (EEG) were unrevealing. Although the patient did not meet CDC testing criteria at that time, he underwent NP-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on HD nine. On HD 10, NP-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and the patient was placed on modified droplet precaution while exposed staff members were instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed given the concern for encephalopathy related to COVID-19. PCR on CSF was negative for SARS-CoV-2. His encephalopathy improved by HD 20 without additional therapies; unfortunately, his discharge was delayed secondary to persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests . On HD 30, CRP was retested and found to be improved at 8.4. He was discharged on HD 33 after two consecutive negative RT-PCR results. During his hospital course, he remained afebrile without pulmonary symptoms, imaging findings, supplemental oxygen requirements, or other signs of infection. All blood, urine, and LP cultures remained negative, and his metabolic encephalopathy was attributed to an atypical COVID-19 infection. Modified droplet precautions were removed once he had two consecutive negative NP RT-PCR tests, and he was discharged to his ALF without further follow-up or subsequent hospitalizations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Table 1 SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and IgG index based on hospital day, Case 1.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Case 2\n\n【9】The following case is of a middle-aged female who was admitted for the treatment of a hepatohydrothorax with negative NP RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. She was readmitted hours after discharge for an empyema, with a repeat negative NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and subsequently developed COVID-19 pneumonia. After 12 days of hospitalization, the NP RT-PCR test detected SARS-CoV-2 concurrently with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (Ab) in her serum.\n\n【10】A fifty-three-year-old Caucasian female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), recurrent hepatohydrothorax, laparoscopic banding with takedown and sleeve gastrectomy, and anxiety and depressive disorder currently undergoing liver transplant evaluation initially presented to an outside hospital with a complaint of dyspnea. She was admitted with hypoxia and a large right pleural effusion. The patient developed hypotension of unknown etiology four days into admission and was transferred to the transplant intensive care unit (T-ICU) at our facility for further management. On presentation to our facility, she was afebrile with initial CXR demonstrating a moderate-large right pleural effusion with passive atelectasis in the right middle and upper lung zones and clear left lung fields. The patient had no known contact with persons with COVID-19 and had a negative NP RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test at the time of transfer. The patient received a pleural pigtail catheter to manage her recurrent right hepatohydrothorax with significant improvement in symptoms on subsequent imaging. She remained afebrile, normotensive, and improved to baseline; she was discharged home after 10 days of hospital care.\n\n【11】Within hours of returning home, the patient re-presented to the ED febrile, encephalopathic, tachycardic, and tachypneic with a maximum temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius. Pertinent data included a leukocytosis of 12.9, creatinine 1.5 (base 0.6), lactic acid 5.1 (from 2.5 the day prior), procalcitonin 0.34 (from 0.06 ten days prior), and a repeat NP RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 that was negative. She was admitted to the T-ICU and initiated on empiric piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and caspofungin for a suspected empyema. The patient initially responded; however, she began spiking fevers on HD eight. A CT chest 10 days after readmission was obtained and revealed a new, dense left-lower lobe consolidation with ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe and anterior left upper lobe with a resolution of her effusion. Despite empiric antimicrobial treatment, she became progressively hypoxic.\n\n【12】She underwent a repeat NP RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 along with serology for IgG Ab by ELISA and both resulted positively . At that time, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and placed on modified droplet precautions. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed thirteen days after readmission; the only positive finding was a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. A repeat CXR fifteen days after readmission revealed worsening bilateral interstitial and airspace opacities; she received lenzilumab for two consecutive treatments and two days later received convalescent plasma. Her COVID-19 pneumonia improved thereafter, and modified droplet precautions were removed once she had two consecutive negative NP RT-PCR tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. She was recommended to wait 21 days from symptom resolution and have two negative COVID tests 24 hours apart to be relisted for liver transplant . Interestingly, her pleural fluid culture from readmission and BAL cultures revealed no growth.\n\n【13】Table 2 SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and IgG index based on hospital day, Case 2.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Case 3\n\n【15】The following case is of a middle-aged man recently recovered from severe COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and a positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【16】A sixty-one-year-old Caucasian male with HTN, HLD, DM2, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetic nephropathy presented to the ED with two days of progressively worsening cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. He had also been experiencing progressive weakness and diarrhea for the preceding 10 days. He had no known exposure to COVID-19. Upon initial exam, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with an oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) of 97% on room air. He was noted to have mild tachypnea and coarse crackles in the bilateral lung fields with the CXR revealing bilateral multifocal consolidations predominantly involving the mid- to lower lung zones. He rapidly deteriorated to a SaO<sub>2</sub> of 71% and was placed on a 100% nonrebreather. Within 12 hours of initial presentation, the patient required mechanical ventilation and was admitted to the intensive care unit. A NP RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 taken on admission returned positive prompting a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and he was placed on modified droplet precautions.\n\n【17】The patient was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Despite having a prolonged hospital course complicated by an Escherichia coli pneumonia superinfection, his respiratory status dramatically improved after 18 days of hospital care. CXR on HD 16 showed persistence of consolidations with minimal improvement. At the time of discharge, he did not require supplemental oxygen and was discharged home.\n\n【18】Six days after discharge, the patient re-presented to the ED with hypoxic respiratory failure, nausea, abdominal pain, and poor oral intake. Upon exam, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable yet tachypneic with a SaO<sub>2</sub> of 84% on room air. Again, he was noted to have coarse bilateral crackles and required 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain a normal SaO<sub>2</sub>. A CXR was significant for a marked bilateral interval increase in the interstitial and airspace opacities with near-complete consolidation at the lingula, when compared to his prior admission. The radiologist noted the findings were concerning for changes of recurrent COVID-related organizing pneumonia. Initial NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative upon readmission, but due to recent COVID-19 pneumonia, it was repeated the next day and found to be positive . At this time, he was placed on modified droplet precautions given the concern for recurrent COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【19】Table 3 SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and IgG index based on hospital day, Case 3.\n\n【20】Laboratory data were significant for a decreased ferritin of 2010 mcg/L (prior admission peak of 4157 mcg/L), a decreased CRP of 31 mg/L (prior admission peak of 193.1 mg/L), and a decreased IL-6 of 7.2 pg/mL (decreased from 67.0 pg/mL). Serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG index was obtained and was 3.58. Despite a positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, the patient’s inflammatory markers had significantly decreased and alternate etiologies for the patient’s readmission were considered. Although the patient was compliant with scheduled hemodialysis, he underwent urgent hemodialysis with ultrafiltration of 4 L with significant clinical improvement. A transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated revealing an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40–45% compared to an LVEF of 53% just 45 days prior. At the time of discharge, the patient was breathing comfortably on room air without supplemental oxygen.\n\n【21】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【22】The rapid expansion of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in response to the EUA issued by the FDA was essential to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. As of June 2020, over 130 FDA-authorized tests to identify current and past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 exist, including molecular (RT-PCR), serology (IgM/IgG), and antigen detection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Serologic testing authorized by the FDA during this unprecedented time is intended to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19; however, providers have been formally advised by the FDA of the limitations of current testing given the absence of a validated diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Weekly EUA testing approval for SARS-CoV-2. (b) Cumulative EUA-approved testing for SARS-CoV-2.</u>\n\n【24】No available tests for SARS-CoV-2 are “FDA-approved”; rather, tests are “FDA-authorized”. The process for FDA approval is lengthy, involving scientific review, regulatory review, assessment of effectiveness and safety, evaluation of performance, review of labeling, quality control mechanisms, and other requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>. As of March 14, 2020, the FDA has reported the “inappropriate promotion” of serologic tests by commercial laboratories including diagnostic application and poor performance during validation trials with the National Institute of Health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In addition to the limitations of testing validity, on March 13, 2020, the President issued a “Memorandum on Expanding State-Approved Diagnostic Tests” authorizing New York State along with any other state that requests the authority to do direct laboratory testing for COVID-19 without FDA validation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【25】To ensure accurate interpretation of a diagnostic test, a thorough knowledge of the methods of testing verification as well as comprehension of applications, limitations, and confounding factors that may influence results is required. Importantly, providers should familiarize themselves with the concept of agreement rates, not sensitivity and specificity. All current FDA-authorized RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 is reported in positive and negative agreement rates due to the absence of an accepted “gold standard”. Sensitivity and specificity are reserved for diagnostic tests with comparative testing to an established “gold standard” which is based on natural specimens. This does not exist for the diagnosis of COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9\\]</u>; under COVID-19 EUA, in vitro analyses are with contrived samples of artificially doped SARS-CoV-2 RNA. “Agreement rates” that approach 100% may be misleading to the public and providers alike, especially when reported out of context 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 10–12, 13\\]</u>. LabCorp has reported their COVID-19 RT-PCR test as having a positive percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 91.24%–100%) and a negative percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 92.87%–100%); Quest Diagnostics has reported a positive and negative percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 88.7–100%) along with a specificity of 100% (72/72, 95% CI: 95–100%), to name a few 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Deepening the above concerns surrounding the rapid development and deployment of testing under an EUA, providers are faced with additional uncertainties surrounding testing for SARS-CoV-2. The three cases above highlight some of these uncertainties and limitations in testing and are meant to encourage thorough interpretation of all clinical and objective data without using isolated results for diagnosis and decision-making.\n\n【27】False-positive RT-PCR results can lead to unnecessary testing or isolation, and individual and community panic. These results are due to replication-incompetent SARS-CoV-2 on PCR testing, as demonstrated in cases one and three by persistent positive results after clinical resolution of COVID-19-related disease. This replication can persist up to 12 weeks postinfection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Furthermore, the CDC updated their guidance on de-escalation of isolation precautions for patients with COVID-19 based on data showing the lack of replication-competent virus after 20 days of onset of disease. False positives suggesting true infection can also develop as a result of viral load kinetics, technical error, sample contamination, detection of an alternative microorganism, amplification errors, and separation techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In addition, FDA recommends 100 bases for nucleic acid-based molecular diagnostic testing; however, DNA probes used in RT-PCR kits for SARS-CoV-2 are 25 bases long, which leads to increased false-positive rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–19\\]</u>.\n\n【28】The second case acknowledges the existence of false-negative results. These are influenced by personnel-specific procedures including standard laboratory techniques, specimen collection including location and technique, and transport and handling. Increased false negatives are also related to the timing of testing and viral shedding, and variability between prime and probe target regions in the SARS genome in the setting of mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Solely relying on RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing for diagnosis in the above three cases could have led to increased invasive testing, increased care cost, misdiagnoses, delay in diagnosis, inappropriate or delayed quarantining, superspreading, and ultimately patient and societal harm.\n\n【30】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】The patient presented in Case 1 above highlights the existence of persistent asymptomatic shedding as well as having a low threshold for diagnosing atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, including encephalopathy and failure to thrive in the elderly. As a resident of an assisted living facility, a failure to initially identify his COVID-19 infection could have resulted in a significant spread to other community members and staff. We recommend maintaining a high index of suspicion for high-risk populations given the “superspreading” potential, and the need to test patients even if they lack the typical respiratory syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The patient presented in Case 2 above highlights the false reassurance providers may have when faced with a negative NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. The patient’s clinical syndrome was consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia despite initial negative testing; she was subsequently found to have a positive NP RT-PCR along with IgG antibodies simultaneously. According to the CDC, it can take 1–3 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after becoming infected but can vary by individual 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. This timeline would imply a false-negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR on admission. Due to the overconfidence in the sensitivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, the patient’s diagnosis and care was delayed and there was an increased risk of exposure to others. NP RT-PCR testing should not be considered in isolation but in the context of patient symptoms and laboratory and radiographic findings.\n\n【33】The patient presented in Case 3 above highlights the importance of expanding a differential diagnosis in the face of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Although recrudescence of COVID-19 is reported, alternate etiologies of the patient’s acute hypoxic respiratory failure were considered. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema secondary to acute systolic heart failure as a consequence of his prior COVID-19 infection was ultimately diagnosed. The positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at readmission was considered persistent shedding of replication-incompetent viral fragments rather than a primary recurrent pulmonary COVID-19 infectious etiology, or a false positive in clinical terms. Additionally, the CDC reports “no confirmed reports to date of a person being reinfected with COVID-19 within 3 months of initial infection” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【34】We strongly advise providers to cautiously interpret the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing in the clinical context of the patients they treat. As mentioned previously, providers should not equate the 100% positive and negative agreement rates to sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. Since tests were developed under an EUA, no official sensitivity or specificity data are available to date. The case examples above highlight common situations of false-positive and false-negative cases seen in clinical practice and remind providers not to rely solely on testing. The accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 infection should combine the clinical presentation and supporting findings along with an accurate interpretation of testing, taking into account the aforementioned details above.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

A 37-year-old woman suffered from hand swelling caused by a house cat licking. At the same time when cavernous angioma had grown, she experienced a numbness in her four extremities, and multifocal peritumoral hyperintense spinal cord signals were seen.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】At the age of 35, the patient developed cervical cavernous angioma on the right side of spinal cord on ventral aspect at the level of the right sixth cervical (C6) vertebra due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A mild numbness of the four extremities remained after SAH. One year later, cavernous angioma had grown, and a numbness of the right upper extremity had been exacerbated. One year and a half after SAH, a numbness had extended from the trunk through both lower extremities, and a new T2-weighted intramedullary high-signal intensity area was found in spinal cord situated at the first to the second thoracic (T1-2) vertebral level 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u>.

Blood Biochemical Findings\n\n【13】The followings were the laboratory results.\n\n【14】Complete blood count results were as follows: white blood cell count 4,400/μL (neutrophils: 65.6%, lymphocytes: 27.3%, monocytes: 4.8%, eosinophils: 1.8%, and basophils: 0.5%), hemoglobin 14.9 g/dL (range: 11.5–15.4), hematocrit 43.7% (range: 33.0–44.0), platelet count 19.8 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL (range: 13.0 × 10<sup>4</sup>–37.0 × 10<sup>4</sup>), total protein 6.8 g/dL (range: 6.7–8.3), albumin 4.4 g/dL (range: 3.8–5.3), AST 11 IU/L (range: 8–38), ALT 8 IU/L (range: 4–44), CPK 51 IU/L (range: 43–165), BUN 12.5 mg/dL (range: 8.0–20.0), creatine 0.71 mg/dL (range: 0.4–0.8), Na 139 mEq/L (range: 135–147), K 4.2 mEq/L (range: 3.3–108), glucose 92 mg/dL (range: 70–110), and C-reactive protein 0.02 mg/dL (range: 0.0–0.3). A nonspecific IgE level was 497 IU/mL (normal range: 0–170), and a specific IgE level to cat dander was 85.5 UA/mL (reference range: 0–0.34). The patient exhibited patch test positivity to any of the following 12 substances: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, cat, dog, Cynodon dactylon, Dactylis glomerata, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Artemisia indica var. maximowiczii, Betula platyphylla, Cryptomeria japonica, Candida, and Alternaria. Antibody against aquaporin-4 was negative. In the meantime, all following test results stayed within a normal range: serum complement level, complement components 3 and 4, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-DNA antibody, anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody, anti-Smith antibody, anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, anticardiolipin and anti–β2-glycoprotein I complex, and lupus anticoagulant.\n\n【15】#### 6\\. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis\n\n【16】Results of CSF analysis were as follows: specific gravity 1.006 (range: 1.005–1.007), protein 29 mg/dL (reference range: 8–43), glucose 68 mg/dL (reference range: 50–75), and total number of cells present 3/μL (3 mononuclear cells, 0 polynuclear cells).\n\n【17】No oligoclonal IgG bands were detected.\n\n【18】#### 7\\. Brain MRI\n\n【19】There were no abnormal findings including high-intensity signals in T2 weighted image.\n\n【20】#### 8\\. Medical Therapy and Posttherapy Course\n\n【21】As a reason for multifocal hyperintense spinal cord signal, we considered the possibility of neuroinflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, or connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis, Behcet’s disease, and so on 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>, other than atopic myelitis, but we were skeptical about these possibilities according to the results of blood biochemical study. The diagnosis of atopic myelitis was made based on the blood biochemical findings, and steroid pulse therapy was performed using methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day, for 3 days). A numbness which has extended from the trunk through the left upper and lower extremities, along with the right lower extremity, disappeared immediately following the therapy. After hospital discharge, efforts were made to segregate a house cat and normalize skin barrier by increasing moisture retention.\n\n【22】#### 9\\. Surgical Management and Postoperative Course\n\n【23】Atopic myelitis did not recur, but cavernous angioma was totally resected because its growth was identified 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>. Imaging findings presented cavernous angioma inside and outside the spinal cord. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital with maintaining independence in the activities of daily living.\n\n【24】#### 10\\. Histopathological Study\n\n【25】Pathological examination of the resected cavernous angioma was performed. Hematoma was present inside the cavernous angioma, and irregularly enlarged vascular structure with thin vascular wall was observed 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u> as the typical pathological findings of cavernous angioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.

Discussion\n\n【28】Atopic myelitis, an allergic disease with high serum levels of IgE and antigen-specific IgE, is the concept of disease advocated by Kira et al. in 1997 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A nationwide survey on atopic myelitis has been conducted by Isobe et al. in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Atopic myelitis is apt to develop after exacerbation of underlying allergic diseases which include atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, and allergic conjunctivitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10\\]</u>. In some way, it seems that atopic myelitis results from the transmission of allergic reaction from the bloodstream to the spinal cord, but the detailed mechanism of atopic myelitis is still unknown.\n\n【30】Symptoms include paresthesia that is not associated with mobility impairment, and most patients initially present with a mild numbness. According to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, high-intensity signal on T2WI is present around the posterior funiculus of the cervical spinal cord 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, gadolinium enhancement and edematous changes in the spinal cord are found in the acute stage, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is locally observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Atopic myelitis is pathologically considered as vasculitis in the presence of invasion by eosinophils which seem to act as effector cells in myelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. Steroid pulse therapy is used to treat atopic myelitis, but the efficacy rate is about 70%. Plasma exchange is used if steroid pulse therapy is ineffective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Cavernous angioma is a type of vascular malformation which grows while repeating extremely light bleeding. Pathologically speaking, vascular structure with irregularly enlarged, thin-walled vessels was observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Cavernous angioma is sometimes identified as the cause of SAH, and extremely light bleeding can be confirmed by T2-star-weighted MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Because cavernous angioma grows while bleeding, the resection of cavernous angioma is considered when neurological deficits are observed after the growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【32】In this case, the patient did not present with previous major atopic disease or exacerbation of atopic disease, such as atopic dermatitis or bronchial asthma, but because of high serum levels of IgE along with a detailed history of the patient, we diagnosed cat allergy, of which the patient herself was not aware. With regard to a miner allergy, attention is required because a detailed history needs to be taken from the patient. In addition, because cavernous angioma had caused SAH and afterward had grown while repeating mild bleeding, BBB breakdown might have occurred in the cervical spinal cord. During the growth of cavernous angioma, the patient developed atopic myelitis in multiple areas adjacent to the angioma, and eosinophil invasion was observed inside the resected cavernous angioma; therefore, BBB breakdown resulting from vascular lesions associated with bleeding may have facilitated the transmission of allergic reaction from the bloodstream to the spinal cord.\n\n【33】#### 12\\. Conclusion\n\n【34】This article is the first case report of atopic myelitis which developed in association with vascular lesions of the central nervous system. BBB breakdown due to angioma may have been involved in the transmission of allergic reaction to the spinal cord.\n\n【35】#### Disclosure\n\n【36】This work was presented at the 51st annual meeting of the Japan Medical Society of Spinal Cord Lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Awareness of this complication and a high level of suspicion allow early diagnosis and treatment, thereby reducing the morbidity of this condition. We present a case of a pseudoaneurysm of a perforating branch of the PFA after revision THA which was treated successfully by selective coil embolization.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pseudoaneurysm of the PFA or its branches is an unusual and serious complication after THA. Vascular injuries are a rare complication after orthopedic surgery of the hip. The complication rate is reported to be approximately 0.2–0.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In a large series of >13,000 cases, an incidence of 0.04% in primary THA increasing to 0.19% in revision surgery was seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Such complications account for the third most common iatrogenic injury after those caused by catheterization and trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. They can result in significant mortality (7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, amputation (1.6%), and persistent ischemia (7.3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These complications can include thromboembolism, direct vessel laceration, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula formation. Etiologies are direct trauma from surgical instruments, joint manipulation and dislocation, protrusion of cement or screws, excessive retraction, and heat injury from the exothermic reaction generated during cement (methyl methacrylate) polymerization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Furthermore, there is an increased incidence in patients undergoing redo arthroplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. As stated by Del Prince et al, the prevalence of vascular injuries post redo arthroplasty ranged between 0.06 and 0.2%. These injuries are classified into 2 groups: acute-onset vascular injury and delayed-onset vascular injury. Acute onset vascular injury may occur intraoperatively secondary to direct trauma from surgical instruments or cement. As mentioned by An et al. delayed vascular injury can result from postoperative trauma to vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Vascular damage resulting from this procedure may present in many ways including pain, obvious bleeding, hemodynamic instability, anemia, a pulsatile mass, and limb ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. De Boer et al. stated that the most common locations of pseudoaneurysms after THA are the external iliac artery and the common femoral artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Injuries and pseudoaneurysms of the PFA and its branches are very rare after THA as the artery is not close to the operation site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 14\\]</u>. Some cases resulting from chronic repeated trauma by a projecting screw were reported after intertrochanteric fracture treated by internal fixation with a dynamic hip screw plate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Recent studies have concentrated on a pseudoaneurysm of the PFA that has been reported approximately two months after THA, in contact with a cement leak from the hole of the removed screw from the prior osteosynthesis of an intertrochanteric fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. Öztürk et al. reported a pseudoaneurysm of the PFA after bipolar hemiarthroplasty, caused by the sharp edge of a fractured lesser trochanter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【7】In light of this, a risk factor for redo procedures is the presence of vascular damage due to THA, an uncommon complication for these injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Because of its location deep in the thigh, pseudoaneurysm of the PFA often presents late with persistent pain and swelling. Patients may not present with the usual sign of a pulsatile mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm is especially dependent upon suspicion because the symptoms and signs are nonspecific which makes it a challenging process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As a result, if there is persistent pain and swelling in the thigh after THA, additional vascular investigations should be performed. Noting that, it can be diagnosed by Doppler ultrasonography or computed tomography. Angiography, however, is needed for definitive diagnosis and for endovascular repair if needed.\n\n【8】In this article, the authors present a case of a pseudoaneurysm of a perforating branch of the PFA following revision THA treated successfully by selective coil embolization.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【10】This article presents a case study of a 50-year-old lady with no significant medical history who underwent a right THA for congenital hip dysplasia. Recurrent dislocations were the indication for revision THA after 6 years.\n\n【11】Two weeks postoperatively, during her stay at the rehabilitation center, she started complaining of severe, worsening pain localized to the right groin. Clinical neurologic and vascular examinations were normal. Radiographs showed satisfactory positioning of the hip prosthesis. The orthopedic consultation revealed no orthopedic origin of her complaints. Duplex ultrasound showed a small pseudoaneurysm arising from the profunda femoris (ying-yang pattern on the color flow and to-and-fro waveform on the spectral doppler); no signs of venous thromboembolism were noted. A trial of ultrasound-guided compression was done without success. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 14 × 22 mm pseudoaneurysm originating from a distal perforating branch of the right PFA . Considering that no thrombin was available for an ultrasound-guided injection of the pseudoaneurysm, the endovascular repair was our treatment of choice. Arteriography was done via left femoral artery retrograde access confirming the presence of the pseudoaneurysm 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. Subsequently, selective catheterization of the distal perforating branch of the right PFA was performed using Progreat™ microcatheter (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and successful embolization was achieved using 2 and 3 mm platinum coils (Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France), placed distal and proximal to the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. Subsequent injection of the contrast medium demonstrated no flow into the pseudoaneurysm 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Following embolization, the patient had a gradual improvement of her symptoms. The patient revealed that she had no pain, claudication, or swelling at follow-up 6 weeks later, and the control CT scan showed no recurrent vascular lesion over a 6-month period .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT with contrast showing the right deep femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Arteriography showing the pseudoaneurysm pre-embolization. (b) Arteriography showing resolution of the pseudoaneurysm postembolization.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 CT with contrast showing resolution of the pseudoaneurysm after embolization (done after 6 months).</u>\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Results and Discussion\n\n【16】In our case, the pseudoaneurysm originated from a distal perforating branch of the PFA. There was no evidence of direct trauma from surgical instruments because it was far from the operation site; also, the injured artery was not in contact with a protrusion of cement, bone edge, or screws. During the operation on a redo case, the hip was moved out of place, which could have torn the blood vessel.\n\n【17】Moreover, the presentation was a nonspecific groin pain 15 days postoperatively, which raised the suspicion of vascular complications and indicated a diagnostic procedure.\n\n【18】Doppler ultrasonography and a CT scan can be used to diagnose pseudoaneurysms in these cases. Angiography, however, was needed for a definitive diagnosis and transcatheter treatment.\n\n【19】Open surgical repair of a pseudoaneurysm of the PFA can be difficult because of the location of the PFA, deep in the muscle compartment of the thigh. Transcatheter or ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection of thrombin, coil, or fibrin adhesive has been reported to occlude a similar pseudoaneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–22\\]</u>. Transcatheter embolization with a coil provided an easier and less invasive technique than open surgical repair in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Nozawa et al. reported a case of pseudoaneurysm of the PFA after THA was treated by transcatheter embolization of the PFA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Lund et al. described the treatment of pseudoaneurysm of the median circumflex artery following THA by coil embolization using selective catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Zhang et al. described 4 cases of successful embolization procedures done to deep femoral artery pseudoaneurysms after hip fracture surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Successful embolization in our case was achieved using selective catheterization of the perforating branch of the PFA and coil embolization distal and proximal to the neck of the pseudoaneurysm to insure complete exclusion. Some opted for endovascular repair using a covered stent. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> However, covered stent placement to seal the pseudoaneurysm was not feasible in our case, as it originated from a distal branch. A US-guided thrombin injection was not available at the time of intervention, although it could also have been considered a treatment option.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】Following THA, pseudoaneurysm of the PFA is quite rare. Early identification and treatment are made possible by knowledge of this consequence and a high degree of suspicion, particularly in redo surgeries. Since it is simpler to reach the deep femoral artery branches and less intrusive than open surgical repair, the endovascular repair was the authors’ method of choice in this situation. This article presented a successful instance of selective coil embolization for the treatment of a pseudoaneurysm of a perforating branch of the PFA after revision THA. This technique was effective and will be useful in future situations similar to this.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Obsessive-compulsive symptom due to brain lesions is not rare, but suppression of these symptoms after head trauma is very rare and we found only 3 cases in review of literatures from 1966 to 2001. The case of a patient suffering with severe OCD is described of note; her symptoms disappeared following right temporo-parietofrontal lesion.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The cardinal manifestations of OCD are recurrent intrusive, ego-dystonic thoughts, images, and urges portending adverse consequences leading to feelings of anxious dread, patients therefore engage in mental and motor compulsions (repetitive ritualized thoughts or acts) in an attempt to neutralize the obsession/adverse consequence. The obsessions or compulsions are time consuming and interfere significantly with the person’s normal routine, occupational functioning, usual social activities, or relationship 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】##### 1.1. Brain-Imaging Studies\n\n【5】Neuroimaging in OCD patients has produced converging data implicating altered function in the neurocircuitry between orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, and thalamus. Various functional brain-imaging studies—for example, positron emission tomography (PET)—have shown increased activity (e.g. metabolism and blood flow) in the frontal lobes, the basal ganglia (especially the caudate), and the cingulum of patients with OCD. The involvement of these areas in the pathways with the amygdale pathway that are the current focus of anxiety disorder research. Pharmacological and behavioral treatments reportedly reverse these abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】In a normal subject, the orbitofrontal cortex would stimulate the caudate, which, in turn, would stimulate the pallid nucleus, consequently inhibiting the medial thalamic nucleus, the main station to the frontal cortex. The medial thalamic nucleus would modulate and correct the hyperactivity of orbitofrontal thalamic stations. Dysfunctions in the modulatory activity of these interconnections may possibly be present in patients with OCD and hyperactivity of the thalamic-orbitofrontal interconnection may produce obsessive thoughts and compulsive rituals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【7】According to this scheme striatal dysfunction leads to inefficient thalamic gating, resulting in hyperactivity within the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex. This could result in the intrusive cognitive phenomena and the associated anxiety. Extending this of thought, compulsions could be conceptualized as repetitive mental and motor behaviors, performed to recruit the striatum so as to ultimately achieve thalamic gating transiently neutralizing the anxiety and thoughts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【8】The most common psychosurgical procedure for OCD is cingulotomy, which is successful in treating 25 to 30 percent of otherwise treatment-unresponsive patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【10】The patient was a 44-year-old female, who has suffered from contamination and pathological doubt obsessions and washing and checking compulsions from adolescence. The score of Yale-Brown scale was thirty. The disorder had deteriorated her social and interpersonal relations, but prior to this accident, she did not take any treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder. In a car accident, a temporoparietal hemorrhage occurred, and she was in coma state for 3 months. After this period, her symptoms disappeared. The score of Yale-Brown scale has been zero yet. MRI images of the brain were performed few days of initial episode of injury showed a temporoparietal hemorrhagic contusion. In followup, after 9 years, MRI showed focal atrophy of the temporal lobe with associated dilatation of the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle . There are multiple foci of high signal intensity within the subcortical and deep cerebral white matter in the parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes. The patient has not any cognition problem, and minimental state score is thirty now.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Axial FLAIR image. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Studies that investigate the pathophysiology of OCD are therefore of considerable importance, because they may ultimately inform treatment strategies. Functional brain imaging in obsessive-compulsive disorder demonstrated decreased blood flow in the temporal lobes as well as cortical perfusion abnormalities in the frontal lobes abnormal blood flow may be seen in a number of different brain regions in acquired OCD. It is unclear whether these changes reflect primary neurological lesions or secondary changes to compensate for such damage. However, increased frontal blood flow in OCD may be hypothesized to reflect a compensatory mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Neuroimaging studies consistently associated dysfunction with prefrontal cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) pathways in obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. According to this scheme striatal dysfunction leads to inefficient thalamic gating, resulting in hyperactivity within the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex. This could result in the intrusive cognitive phenomena and the associated anxiety. Extending this of thought, compulsions could be conceptualized as repetitive mental and motor behaviors, performed to recruit the striatum so as to ultimately achieve thalamic gating transiently neutralizing the anxiety and thoughts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It is noteworthy that the orbitofrontal cortex might play a potential role in inhibitory motor control. This may be of special importance given the compulsions presented in OCD and the patients; attempts to resist performing these actions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our review of Medline from 1966 to 2001 showed that our patient is the 4th case of OCD whose symptoms significantly disappeared following head trauma. One is a patient with severe obsessive illness who sustained a severe head injury. As a consequence of his injury, the patient developed a left prefrontal subdural haematoma. Upon his recovery, the obsession symptoms disappeared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The other case is a man who attempted suicide by shooting his head over the left temple, causing left frontal lobe damage. Although no frontal lobe syndrome emerged, his obsessive rituals were significantly reduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The other case following the clinical diagnosis of arterial hypertension he sustained a brain hemorrhage. As a consequence of this cerebral accident his obsessive-compulsive symptoms were absent. However, as a progression of the clot retraction began gradually to take place, his obsessive-compulsive symptoms considerably returned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The connection of these three cases, associated with OCD, indicates that specific cerebral sites affected by a given lesion may ablate “therapeutically” a preexisting disorder that is OCD. Furthermore, because in one case lesions are located in the left basal ganglia region, the other two in the left frontal region, and in our case, lesions located in temporoparietoccipital. Suggests that lesions affect association circuits linking neuronal columns of the BG and the prefrontal area, regardless of a specific anatomical location within the operational circuit, may modify obsessive-compulsive symptomatology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Thus, nonspecific signs or symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract-abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, palpable abdominal mass, diarrhea, or constipation may represent difficulties in the differential diagnosis of a benign disease that eventually has malignant behavior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Except in cases of rectal nodules, intestinal endometriosis cannot be diagnosed only by physical examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Description\n\n【6】A 51-year-old female, from Guaíba, South of Brazil, was referred to a gastroenterology outpatient clinic at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. She had noticed a decrease in her bowel habits (evacuations every three days), as well as sharp and long stools, with progressive worsening during one year period. She also had intermittent episodes of elimination of red blood mixed with feces, every 3–4 weeks; she denied associated abdominal pain, weight loss, or night sweats. On physical examination, blood pressure was 124 × 78 mmHg, heart rate 80bpm, and respiratory rate 14 and normal pulmonary and cardiac auscultations were performed. The abdomen was painless, without palpable masses or visceromegaly, and normal bowel sounds were present. The rectal examination showed no nodules, bleeding, or masses, and there was no palpable enlargement of the lymph nodes.\n\n【7】Personal and family history: symptomatic cholelithiasis (awaiting surgery), two previous cesarean sections (G2P2), and hysterectomy in 2011 (fibroids). She denied continued use of medications, alcoholism, smoking, or drug use. She had no family history of gastrointestinal tract disease or any type of cancer.\n\n【8】Investigations were performed initially with laboratory tests (blood count, renal function, electrolytes, liver function tests were normal). Afterwards, she underwent tomography of the abdomen (CT), showing two areas of irregular parietal thickening, one in the upper rectum with approximately 3.0 cm extension and the other in the middle segment of the sigmoid colon, measuring about 2.5 cm in length, presenting impregnation with contrast . These lesions were stenosing but did not determine significant upstream intestinal obstruction. Among the diagnostic possibilities, a synchronic colorectal neoplasia was highlighted. An opaque enema was performed before performing a colonoscopy that confirmed the findings of the CT scan. During rectosigmoidoscopy, the device was inserted up to 30 cm from the anal margin, where a concentric stenosis was observed, covered by macroscopically normal mucosa, preventing the progression of the device. At 15 cm from the anal margin, a caliber reduction area covered by irregular and friable mucosa was observed. A biopsy specimen was performed and the anatomopathological study resulted in colonic mucosa without relevant alterations.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Abdomen tomography with stenosing lesions in the upper rectum and sigmoid presenting impregnation with contrast, as shown by the pointing arrow.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Coronal image of abdomen tomography with stenosing lesions in sigmoid presenting impregnation with contrast, as shown by the pointing arrow.</u>\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Sagital image of abdomen tomography with stenosing lesions in the upper rectum presenting impregnation with contrast, as shown by the pointing arrow.</u>\n\n【12】The surgical team evaluated the patient and decided to perform a rectosigmoidectomy with cholecystectomy, which had no complications and evidenced the two stenoses mentioned in the tomography with surrounding fibrotic adhesions. The anatomopathological study of the surgical specimen evidenced intestinal wall endometriosis, compromising submucosa and internal and external muscular layers, with fibrosis. The patient subsequently evolved with complete improvement of the referred symptoms.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Low intestinal bleeding, represented in the case reported as hematochezia, is a sign of different pathologies, from benign to malignant. What is noticeable in this case are the intestinal cycling changes that the patient presented, rectal bleeding every 3–4 weeks, which should alert to the diagnosis of endometriosis. Inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, neoplastic diseases, diverticular disease, and hemorrhoidal disease are part of the differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Some patients have multiple lesions of endometriosis involving more than one intestinal segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, two areas of irregular parietal thickening were found, one in the upper rectum and the other in the middle segment of the sigmoid colon, which were initially interpreted as suspect of synchronic neoplasia but which, in fact, were found to be compatible with endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【16】It is known that the extension of the disease is not necessarily related to the intensity of the symptoms; many women are asymptomatic with extensive disease by incidental finding, as some women with mild illness have disabling symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In addition, deep infiltrative endometriosis (DIE) of the intestine invades at least at the level of the serosa and the muscular layer itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The patient in the case had no symptoms until a year ago, including most of her reproductive life without the classics symptoms of endometriosis (dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and infertility) and the anatomopathological study indicated as intestinal wall DIE, compromising submucosa and internal and external muscular layers, with fibrosis, and therefore, evidenced extensive disease by the pathology classification.\n\n【17】In addition, endometrial tissue outside the uterus is probably an underdiagnosed disease according to some reports, presumably some patients with functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome may actually have intestinal endometriosis, since the symptoms of both pathologies are nonspecific.Thus, the diagnosis of endometriosis is relevant because it offers a simple treatment in menacme, for example, using hormone therapy.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】Large bowel endometriosis is a diagnostic challenge and should be remembered between differential diagnoses of nonspecific or even alarming symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The purpose of this case report was to describe successful revascularization treatment of an immature mandibular right second premolar with apical periodontitis in a 9-year-old female patient. After preparing an access cavity without anesthesia, the tooth was isolated using a rubber dam and accessed. The canal was gently debrided using 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 3% hydrogen peroxide irrigant. And then MTA was packed into the canal. X-ray photographic examination showed the dentin bridge 5 months after the revascularization procedure. Thickening of the canal wall and complete apical closure were confirmed 10 months after the treatment. In this case, MTA showed clinical and radiographic success at revascularization treatment in immature permanent tooth. The successful outcome of this case suggests that MTA is reliable and effective for endodontic treatment in the pediatric dentistry.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Immature permanent teeth with apical periodontitis or an abscess are generally treated by apexification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, revascularization procedures have recently been recommended to treat immature permanent teeth with necrotic pulp tissue and/or apical periodontitis or an abscess.\n\n【4】Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a material used worldwide in a variety of clinical applications, such as an apical barrier for teeth with immature apices, repair of root perforations, root-end filling, pulp capping, and pulpotomy procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–9\\]</u>. In this paper successful revascularization treatment of an immature mandibular right second premolar with apical periodontitis in a 9-year-old patient using MTA was described.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】In June 2012, a 9-year-old Japanese girl was referred to private clinic by a general dentist for detailed examination of a gingival abscess in the mandibular right second premolar. The medical history of the patient was unremarkable, and there was no relevant family history of medical or dental abnormalities. An extraoral examination revealed swelling in the buccal region and the patient complained of spontaneous pain. Furthermore, an intraoral examination revealed a gingival abscess in the region of the mandibular right second premolar 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>.

The pulp vitality test was negative. The clinical diagnosis was acute periradicular periodontitis of the mandibular right second premolar with pulpal necrosis.\n\n【9】The patient underwent oral surgery at Kyushu Dental University Hospital. The reason for hospitalization was because she was not able to eat for gingival swelling and spontaneous pain. During hospitalization, she received an intravenous drip containing an antibiotic. She left the hospital 6 days later and was referred to our clinic. Postsurgery intraoral examination showed no abnormalities on the gingiva of the mandibular right second premolar 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. However, the talon cusp of the mandibular right second premolar was fractured 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Without using anesthetic, the tooth was isolated with a rubber dam and accessed. Upon entering the coronal aspect of the root canal, hemorrhaging into the pulp chamber was observed 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. A file of 10 K size was inserted into the canal. The length of file is 10 mm. And the patient reported discomfort, indicating potential survival of residual vital pulp tissue. The hemorrhaging in the coronal portion of the canal was gently irrigated; then the area was debrided using 1.5 mL of 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 1.5 mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 10\\]</u>. No instrumentation was performed. Next, MTA (Pro-Root MTA, Dentsply Sankin, Tochigi, Japan) was packed into the canal using MAP system (Dentsply Sankin, Tochigi, Japan) 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u> and the access cavity was closed with glass-ionomer cement (Fuji IX GP, GC, Tokyo, Japan).

It is too far for her to refer to our clinic. So we could not follow up her.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Apexogenesis is done is in immature teeth when part of the pulp tissue inside the root canal remains vital and apparently healthy. This procedure allows continued physiological development and formation of the root end.\n\n【17】In cases with an immature root with a large apical foramen, pulp infection associated with an apical lesion does not always indicate pulp necrosis, as seen in our patient, likely because the pulp at this stage is vital enough and has extremely high healing ability. Those procedures have been shown to result in increased thickening of the canal walls by deposition of hard tissue and encourage continued root development in affected immature permanent teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–13\\]</u>. Continued root development of revascularization of immature permanent necrotic teeth depends on whether Hertwig’s epithelial sheath survives in cases of apical periodontitis/abscess.　Hertwig’s epithelial sheath has important role in root development and shape and may be involved in regulation of the differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells with the formation of cementum.\n\n【18】MTA is a cement material with excellent biocompatibility and good sealing capacity that is able to produce hard tissues such as dentin and cementum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. It is used for apexification and sealing of communication between the root and periodontal tissue, such as in reverse root canal filling and perforation repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, there are few reports of its use for pulp revascularization using MTA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 16\\]</u>. Calcium hydroxide formulations are typically used for apexogenesis and poor sealing capacity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Furthermore, formation of a necrotic layer immediately beneath the pulp can occur and the procedure must be changed to a pulpectomy in some cases due to spreading inflammation, as it does not provide an adequate biodefense mechanism against even a limited bacterial invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Accordingly, we used MTA in this case. Generally, the root of a tooth with pulp revascularization is smaller than a mature tooth and is characterized by more rapid calcification of the pulp than that seen after a conventional apexogenesis procedure, as noted in the present case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Chen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> demonstrated five types of response of these immature teeth with infected necrotic pulp tissue and apical periodontitis/abscess to revascularization procedures: type 5, formation of a hard tissue barrier in the canal between the coronal cement plug and root apex using MTA. The present case was consistent with type 5. In cases with an immature root with a large apical foramen, pulp infection associated with an apical lesion does not always indicate pulp necrosis, as seen in our patient, likely because the pulp at this stage is vital enough and has extremely high healing ability. It has been reported that pulp revascularization was induced by removing infective material from the root canal and applying calcium hydroxide past MTA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 12\\]</u>. Traditionally, in the clinical protocol for revascularization treatment, several kinds of antibacterial medicine were used. But, recently, it reported that a single-visit pulp revascularization protocol can be a favorable treatment for partially necrotic immature permanent teeth using MTA as a pulpal seal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Accordingly, for immature tooth with a pulp infection and open apical foramen, treatment should start with pulp revascularization and then shift to apexification if incurable, while considering the infection to be reversible.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】In the present case, clinical and radiographic evidence showed successful use of MTA for revascularization treatment of an immature permanent tooth. More studies are necessary to understand the mechanisms of pulp revascularization comparing different protocols.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In the usual setting, patients with FAP are identified based on their germline mutations and the diagnosis of thyroid neoplasm is made after the FAP diagnosis. We herein report a case in which the recognition of a CMVPTC led to the initial diagnosis of FAP. The histological and clinical features of CMVPTC are reviewed with emphasis on its relationship to FAP.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Thyroid neoplasms occur in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with a frequency reported to be increased to as much as 100–160 times the rate seen in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, in a report of 28 tumors in 4 patients with FAP, were the first to recognize and describe in detail the unusual morphology of these tumors. They suggested that FAP-associated thyroid tumors have similarities to typical papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), but are sufficiently unique that they should be considered a tumor distinct from both follicular and papillary carcinoma. There are two reported cases in the literature of recognition of this unusual thyroid neoplasm leading to the diagnosis of familial polyposis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>; sporadic counterparts, non FAP associated, have been described as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. We herein describe a case of diagnosis of FAP in an individual without a family history of colonic disease based on recognition of a thyroid neoplasm of unusual morphology.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 23-year-old Chinese woman underwent total thyroidectomy for a painless enlargement of the thyroid gland. The enlargement had first been noted 10 years prior to admission, and there had been a gradual increase in size during the intervening period. The patient had no family history of colorectal cancer and both parents were in good health. She did not have any gastrointestinal symptoms and was otherwise well. A total thyroidectomy was performed for a clinical diagnosis of nodular goitre.\n\n【6】On the basis of the thyroid pathology, a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed. This revealed numerous small (<5 mm) polyps scattered in clusters from rectum to descending colon. Biopsies of these polyps showed that they were all tubular adenomas. At colonoscopy there were more than 100 small polyps throughout the colon but predominantly left-sided. There were no polyps found on esophagogastroduodenoscopy. DNA extracted from blood lymphocytes showed a truncating mutation in segment 1 of the APC gene by protein truncation analysis, confirming the diagnosis of FAP. A total colectomy was performed.\n\n【7】One year following colectomy, two firm, immobile intraabdominal masses were noted on physical examination. An ultrasound directed biopsy of the masses revealed fibromatosis.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【9】The thyroidectomy specimen was fixed in formalin, and representative paraffin-embedded sections were routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with the labelled streptovidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system using a panel of antibodies .\n\n【10】Table 1 Antibody information.\n\n【11】##### 3.1. Pathology\n\n【12】The excised thyroid weighed 72 g and contained one nodule (5 × 4 × 4 cm) in the right lobe and three nodules in the left lobe ranging in size from 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.5 to 3 × 2.5 × 2.0 cm.\n\n【13】Light microscopic examination revealed that the three nodules in the left lobe were surrounded by fibrous capsules of varying thickness. The architectural patterns within the nodules were variable, but papillae were present at least focally in each tumor. The papillae were generally short and blunt with edematous cores. A prominent finding within all of the nodules were cribriform structures composed of follicles deficient in colloid and lined by flattened to low cuboidal epithelial cells with scant intervening fibrous tissue . Other portions of the tumor nodules had a trabecular arrangement of tall columnar cells. Frequently within these trabecular areas and to a lesser extent elsewhere, there were small whorls of cells 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. The tumor cell nuclei were oval and overlapping with irregular outlines. Nuclear grooves were readily identified and occasional typical intranuclear cytoplasmic pseudoinclusions were present. Many of the cells within the whorls had nuclei with a pale eosinophilic to clear appearance 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. There was no necrosis or mitotic activity present.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Histological features of CMV variant of PTC.

Discussion\n\n【18】The extraintestinal associations of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are wellknown and include osteomas, epidermoid cysts, fibromatosis, adrenal, biliary, liver, and brain neoplasms (some kindreds with Turcot's syndrome) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> as well as thyroid carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. The risk of development of thyroid carcinoma in FAP is not known with certainty. A report from a large FAP registry indicated that 1.2% of affected individuals develop thyroid carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Two large studies of FAP patients found a relative risk of developing thyroid carcinoma of 7.6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and 23 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> compared to the general population. However, amongst females with polyposis, the risk has been estimated at 100–160 times greater than expected in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Some authors have recommended that FAP patients be screened for the development of thyroid carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>, but this is controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The FAP-associated thyroid tumors reported in the literature have been variably diagnosed as papillary, follicular, or mixed papillary and follicular carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported four cases of thyroid carcinoma in FAP patients with a review of the literature and noted the following unusual features: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>female : male ratio of 8 : 1 (2 : 1 to 4 : 1 in sporadic PTC); other studies have found an even more striking female predominance (f : m—17 : 1) for this particular subtye 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>,通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>majority under age 30 ( most in 30–50 age group in sporadic PTC),通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>multifocality (differing from sporadic PTC multifocality-tumors encapsulated, circumscribed, differing architectural patterns), and通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>unusual histologic patterns: cribriform, solid, spindling, and whorls.\n\n【20】The authors concluded that FAP-associated thyroid carcinomas were likely related to PTC, but were sufficiently different to warrant status as a distinct entity.\n\n【21】Based on the distinct and unusual morphology of the thyroid tumors occurring in FAP patients, Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> suggested that the recognition of such a tumor should prompt investigation for FAP. The investigation in the case reported herein led to a diagnosis of FAP, supporting their recommendation.\n\n【22】However, Cameselle-Teijeiro and Chan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> described 4 cases with similar or identical morphology apparently occurring in patients without FAP. Others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 12\\]</u> have also described similar tumors, again in patients without evidence of FAP. These tumors have been termed the “cribriform-morular” variant of PTC (CMV PTC) by Cameselle-Teijeiro and Chan in recognition of their two most prominent and unusual patterns. The cribriform areas are composed of anastomosing bars and arches of cells without intervening stroma with the follicular spaces devoid of colloid. The morulas are composed of spindled cells with “peculiar nuclear clearing.” These clear nuclei differ from both the optically clear nuclei and intranuclear pseudoinclusions more typically seen in PTC and consist of accumulations of biotin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> speculated that the morphology of this apparently distinctive tumor might be related to the involvement of the APC gene in the pathogenesis. Several groups have analyzed APC gene mutations. Cetta et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> analyzed four tumors from patients with known germline APC mutations. They found no examples of biallelic inactivation. Soravia et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> studied 9 samples from 4 tumors and found somatic APC mutation in 1 sample. However, Iwama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> found germline and somatic mutation of APC gene in 2 cases of FAP-associated thyroid carcinomas. These findings suggest that, although somatic mutation of APC gene may be seen in some cases of FAP-associated thyroid carcinoma, it is not a required step in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms. However, a number of studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14, 16\\]</u> have shown evidence of ret/PTC-1 oncogene activation, which is known to be an early molecular event in papillary thyroid carcinoma oncogenesis. This finding would support the concept that FAP-associated thyroid tumors are variants of PTC.\n\n【24】More recently Xu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> have demonstrated that aberrant nuclear accumulation of mutant beta-catenin may substitute for APC mutations in a subset of CMV of PTC . It is thought that these sporadic cases are due to a somatic mutation in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1), further highlighting the analogous role to the APC-beta-catenin pathway. Although only a small number of cases have been studied, the most common carcinogenic genetic abnormality in papillary thyroid carcinoma—BRAF mutation—appears to be absent in FAP-associated thyroid cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Thyroid carcinomas occurring in FAP patients have unusual clinical and pathological features, but morphologic and molecular evidence supports the concept that these are variants of PTC. Although the morphologic features are unusual and rarely seen in sporadic PTC, recent reports have emphasized that they are not specific for FAP. Nevertheless, they are sufficiently uncommon that their presence in a thyroid tumor should prompt investigation for FAP.

De novo TMA may also be drug-induced when calcineurin inhibitors or proliferation signal inhibitors are used. We report three cases of de novo drug-induced TMA in renal transplant patients who were managed by replacing calcineurin inhibitors or proliferation signal inhibitors with belatacept, a primary maintenance immunosuppressive drug, which blocks the CD28 costimulation pathway, preventing the activation of T lymphocytes. To identify the cause of TMA, we ruled out HUS, hepatitis C serology, HIV serology, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, anti-HLA antibodies, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. We suspect that the TMA was caused by the calcineurin inhibitors or proliferation signal inhibitors. Belatacept treatment was initiated at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1, 5, 14, 28, 60, and 90; maintenance treatment was 5 mg/kg once a month for 1 year. Belatacept, in combination with other agents, prevented graft rejection in three patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), a severe complication of renal transplantation, is a pathological process that involves microvascular occlusion, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. When renal lesions are more common, the clinical entity is defined as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and when brain lesions prevail, it is termed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Posttransplant TMA can occur de novo or may be recurrent if the patient’s end-stage renal disease involved HUS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The incidence of de novo TMA in renal transplantation is reportedly 0.8% to 3.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. It generally appears within the first weeks after transplantation, when immunosuppressive drugs are used at high doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Although the exact pathogenesis of TMA is not fully understood, it has been found that de novo TMA may be drug-induced when calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) or proliferation signal inhibitors (PSIs) are used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Other risk factors include ischemia-reperfusion injury, viral infections, and antibody-mediated rejection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】If TMA is not treated, it can lead to graft loss or renal cortical necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Typical strategies for treatment of de novo TMA include reduction or withdrawal of CNI, switching from CNIs to PSIs, such as sirolimus, reducing the CNI, and then restoring it after clinical recovery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. Other suggested therapies include plasmapheresis and the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in combination with steroids, rituximab, or eculizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 7, 8\\]</u>. Choosing the right immunosuppressive therapy strategy represents a challenge because both CNIs and PSIs have been associated with TMA, but good results have also been reported with use of these agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 9, 10\\]</u>. To our knowledge, the use of belatacept has been reported only once previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.

Here, we report three renal transplant patients with de novo drug-induced TMA who were managed with belatacept as an alternative immunosuppressive agent.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Patient 1\n\n【7】A 33-year-old male received a living-relative renal transplant; his mother was the donor. When the patient was 8 months old, he had suffered from typical HUS. Induction therapy consisted of basiliximab on day 0, and because the graft showed delayed function, antithymocyte globulin at 1.25 mg/kg daily was administered for 6 days. Maintenance therapy consisted of tacrolimus, MPA, and prednisone; ganciclovir was used for CMV prophylaxis. On postoperative day (POD) 150, to prevent toxicity related to CNI, tacrolimus was discontinued and replaced with everolimus at 1.50 mg daily with a goal trough of 3–8 ng/mL, and MPA was administered at 1440 mg daily. On POD 240, his creatinine level was 154.70 μmol/L (1.75 mg/dL). On POD 330, the patient became intolerant of MPA and developed diarrhea; the drug was withdrawn, and prolonged-release tacrolimus at 7 mg was introduced. On POD 740, the patient was admitted with deteriorating renal function and creatinine of 291.72 μmol/L (3.3 mg/dL). A biopsy confirmed mesangiolysis and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) Grade I 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. C4d staining was negative, no glomerulitis or capillaritis was present, and detection of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) by Luminex was negative. At the time of TMA diagnosis, laboratory tests showed the following values: creatinine 247.52 μmol/L, hemoglobin 141 g/L, platelet count 145000/mm<sup>3</sup>, tacrolimus trough level 10.4 ng/mL, everolimus 7.6 ng/mL, total bilirubin 25.65 μmol/L, and unconjugated bilirubin 7.86 μmol/L, and no schistocyte was detected. Recurrence of HUS and other possible causes were ruled out. Tacrolimus and everolimus were discontinued, and belatacept was introduced, beginning at 10 mg/kg on days 1, 5, 14, 28, 60, and 90; maintenance treatment was 5 mg/kg once a month for 1 year. Other immunosuppressive drugs included prednisone at 4 mg daily and MPA at 1440 mg daily. On POD 800, 60 days after the TMA diagnosis, his creatinine was 194.48 μmol/L (2.2 mg/dL), and a repeat biopsy showed no TMA.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Light micrographs showing TMA.

Patient 2\n\n【10】A 55-year-old female, with unknown primary renal disease, who had been on hemodialysis for 5 years, underwent a transplant with her sister as the donor. After induction therapy with basiliximab at 20 mg on days 0 and 4, she showed good diuresis and a decrease in her urea and creatinine levels. Immunosuppression was achieved with corticosteroids, tacrolimus at 0.15 mg/kg to achieve a trough level of 6–10 ng/dL, and MPA at 1440 mg/day; prophylaxis against infection consisted of ganciclovir and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. At the time of discharge on POD 5, her creatinine was 137.02 μmol/L (1.55 mg/dL). On POD 15, the patient’s creatinine was 300.56 μmol/L (3.4 mg/dL). A biopsy confirmed Banff Ia cellular rejection; treatment with three pulses of methylprednisolone resulted in a decreased creatinine level. Between POD 15 and 30, the patient’s course was complicated by deep vein thrombosis, a hematoma on the abdominal wall, and a urinary fistula. On POD 20, she was admitted with pain in the area of the graft, an increased creatinine level of 548.08 μmol/L (6.2 mg/dL), and Banff IIa cellular rejection. Antithymocyte globulin was administered at 1.25 mg/kg daily for 10 days. On POD 25, her creatinine increased again, prompting us to perform another biopsy that confirmed acute TMA in the initial phase, mild ATN, and IFTA Grade I 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. C4d staining was negative, there was no sign of glomerulitis or capillaritis, and detection of anti-HLA antibodies by Luminex was negative. At the time of TMA diagnosis, test values were as follows: creatinine 548 μmol/L (6.19 mg/dL), platelet count 55000/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin 91 g/L, tacrolimus trough level 15.7 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 167 IU/L, and total bilirubin 5.98 μmol/L, and no schistocytes were found. Plasma exchange sessions and administration of IVIg at 100 mg/kg after plasmapheresis were performed. Other possible causes were ruled out. Belatacept was started at 10 mg/kg on days 1, 5, 14, 28, 60, and 90; maintenance treatment was 5 mg/kg once a month for 1 year. Additionally, the patient continued to receive MPA and prednisone. On POD 90, a biopsy showed no sign of rejection or TMA, her creatinine level was 90.17 μmol/L (1.02 mg/dL), and she did not develop any serious adverse event.\n\n【11】##### 2.3. Patient 3\n\n【12】A 44-year-old male who had been on hemodialysis for 2 years underwent a living-relative transplant with his brother as the donor. His baseline renal disease was unknown. Induction therapy consisted of thymoglobulin and maintenance immunosuppression corticosteroids, tacrolimus at 0.15 mg/kg to achieve a trough level of 6–10 ng/dL, and MPA at 1440 mg/day; prophylaxis against infection consisted of ganciclovir and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. At the time of discharge on POD 4, his creatinine was 125.53 μmol/L (1.42 mg/dL). On POD 8, a biopsy performed because of a creatinine increase showed Banff Ia cellular rejection, which was treated successfully with three pulses of methylprednisolone. On POD 13, a control biopsy showed mesangiolysis and double contours 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. C4d staining was negative, there was no sign of glomerulitis or capillaritis, and detection of anti-HLA antibodies by Luminex was negative. Associated causes were ruled out, and it was suspected that the TMA was drug-related. At the time of the TMA diagnosis, no DSA was detected, and laboratory test values were as follows: creatinine 178.57 μmol/L (2.02 mg/dL), platelet count 218000/mm<sup>3</sup>, tacrolimus trough level 6.9 ng/dL hemoglobin 88 g/L, LDH 230 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.20 μmol/L, and haptoglobin 1.06 g/L, and no schistocytes were found. Tacrolimus treatment was suspended, and belatacept was initiated at 10 mg/kg on days 1, 5, 14, 28, 60, and 90; maintenance treatment was 5 mg/kg once a month for 1 year. The creatinine level decreased. On POD 31, a control biopsy showed Banff IIa cellular rejection that was treated with ATG. Administration of belatacept continued as planned. On POD 40, a biopsy showed no sign of rejection or TMA; his creatinine level was 122.88 μmol/L (1.39 mg/dL).\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Although mortality associated with TMA has decreased since the introduction of plasma exchange therapy, it can still be a life-threatening condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In patients who have undergone renal transplantation, the incidence of TMA is higher than in the general population and can lead to graft loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>, reaching as high as 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The most common factors for developing posttransplant de novo TMA are associated with deceased-donor transplantation, but TMA also occurs in living-donor transplantation as a result of CMV, HIV, and therapy with specific drugs, among other factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. At our center, between 2009 and 2012, 118 renal transplants were performed at our center, and the incidence of TMA in renal transplant patients was 3.4%.\n\n【15】Drug-induced TMA and AMR as a predisposing factor for TMA should be worked up as differential diagnoses because the two entities, which are difficult to distinguish, require different therapeutic strategies. C4d staining of peritubular capillaries is typical in AMR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and can be used as a diagnostic criterion. Additionally, the detection of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies and the presence of glomerulitis and capillaritis in the biopsy are diagnostic markers of AMR. In our cases, to be able to conclude that TMA was drug-induced, we ruled out possible associations with HIV, hepatitis C, CMV, parvovirus B19, anti-HLA antibodies, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. However, it is important to note that recurrent HUS is difficult or even impossible to rule out. Two of the patients did not show signs of hemolytic anemia, only creatinine level increases, which are common in posttransplant TMA, when diagnosis can be confirmed by biopsy only.\n\n【16】The effects of immunosuppression on drug-induced TMA remain to be determined, and guidelines have not yet been established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Reported options to treat drug-induced TMA include withdrawal of the offending drug and replacement with another, such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or everolimus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>; usually, this is accompanied by plasma exchange or infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10\\]</u>. More recently, eculizumab in TMA associated with AMR has been suggested for prophylaxis or as an alternative treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 10\\]</u>. However, the use of sirolimus alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> or in combination with cyclosporine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> has been associated with an increased risk of developing TMA. When drug-induced TMA is treated with discontinuation of the CNI or PSI alone, the graft loss rate can be 60–100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It has been reported that belatacept was used successfully as an immunosuppressive drug in transplant patients with de novo TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and this guided our choice of the agent. Belatacept is a primary maintenance immunosuppressive drug that blocks the CD28 costimulation pathway, preventing the activation of T lymphocytes. It is used in combination with other agents to prevent graft rejection in de novo renal transplant patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 16\\]</u>. We used a low-intensity regimen, administered as described above. Also, we used belatacept as if administered de novo to achieve an effective immunosuppression regimen with three agents, as is always performed at our center. The use of belatacept does have two main shortcomings that should be considered: its cost and its administration by intravenous infusion. As an adjunct therapy to belatacept introduction and offending drug withdrawal, we used plasmapheresis in one of our patients, following recommendations found in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【18】To our knowledge, this is the largest series of renal transplant patients with de novo drug-induced TMA managed with belatacept as an alternative immunosuppressive drug. The cause of TMA resolution could not be identified because of the multiple and simultaneous factors involved in each case. We acknowledge the limitation of the very short-duration followup in our cases. Although we cannot generalize our results, they support the promising outcomes of previous case reports that belatacept was an effective and safe alternative immunosuppressive agent for the management of renal transplant patients with de novo drug-induced TMA.\n\n【19】#### Abbreviations\n\n| AMR: | Antibody mediated rejection |\n| --- | --- |\n| CNI: | Calcineurin inhibitors |\n| DSA: | Donor-specific antibodies |\n| HUS: | Hemolytic uremic syndrome |\n| IVIg: | Intravenous immunoglobulin |\n| MPA: | mycophenolic acid |\n| POD: | Postoperative day |\n| TMA: | Thrombotic microangiopathy |\n| PSI: | Proliferation signal inhibitors. |\n\n【21】#### Disclosure\n\n【22】The authors of this manuscript have no conflicts of interest to disclose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Due to the propensity for hematogenous spread leading to fatal sepsis, the infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum have high mortality rate (65–80%) with death occurring in as less as one week of acquiring infection. So, prompt proper treatment is necessary for successful treatment of the infections but, due to the rarity of the infections caused by the organism, there is limited awareness among the clinicians regarding the infections caused by this organism. Here, we reported a case of urinary tract infection caused by Chromobacterium violaceum in a 84-year-old male, who was a kidney patient, and another case of bacteremia caused by the same bacterium in a road traffic accident patient (22-year-old male), both of which were managed with the timely suitable treatment.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Chromobacterium violaceum is ubiquitously present in the environment of tropical and subtropical regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a normal flora of water and soil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Human infections caused by this organism are very rare, due to which there is limited awareness about the infections caused by the bacterium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Till 2007, around 150 cases of human infections have been reported worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and recently four cases of infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum have been reported from Nepal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–5\\]</u>. In general, Chromobacterium violaceum is involved in causing fatal cases of sepsis, visceral abscesses, and skin and soft tissue infections with mortality rate up to 65–80% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. But urinary tract infections caused by this organism are extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In this study, we reported two cases of infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case 1 (Urinary Tract Infection)\n\n【5】An 84-year-old chronic kidney disease patient attended the outpatient department of a hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, with chief complaints of lower abdominal pain and fever. The patient had history of recurrent urinary tract infection for last 8 years. He was recently treated for urinary tract infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and was catheterized for last 2 weeks. After the necessary physical examination, the patient was suggested for laboratory investigation. In urine microscopic examination, significant bacteriuria with large numbers of pus cells per low power field was detected.\n\n【6】On the basis of the patient’s clinical symptoms, history of recurrent urinary tract infection, and urine microscopic examination report, the patient was empirically treated with ofloxacin. The abnormal laboratory findings seen were increased C-reactive protein (15 mg/dL), raised blood creatinine (2.7 mg/dL), and raised total leukocyte count (17,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) with neutrophilia (80%).\n\n【7】The clean catch urine plated on cystine lactose electrolyte deficient agar showed the growth of single type of bacterial colonies in the concentration more than 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/mL after 24 hrs of aerobic incubation at 37°C . The colonies grown were around 2 to 3 mm in diameter, convex, nonlactose fermenting, round, glistening, and smooth and produced violet nondiffusible pigment . The organism was Gram-negative rod and was motile and catalase and oxidase producing, citrate utilizing, and nitrate reducing. Further, the bacterial isolate decarboxylated arginine but did not decarboxylate lysine and ornithine and hydrolysed gelatin but did not hydrolyse esculin. It did not produce urease, indole, and DNase. Methyl red test and Voges-Proskauer test were negative. In triple sugar iron agar, it gave alkaline slant by acidic butt without any gas and hydrogen sulfide. The bacterium utilized glucose, fructose, and trehalose but did not utilize mannitol, sucrose, lactose, and xylose. The pigment formation was observed only after incubation under aerobic condition.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Colonies of Chromobacterium violaceum in cystine lactose electrolyte deficient agar.</u>\n\n【9】On the basis of all these properties, the organism was identified as Chromobacterium violaceum. For antimicrobial susceptibility testing, Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique was used. The organism was found to be sensitive toward ofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, amikacin, imipenem, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam and resistant toward nitrofurantoin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Due to high propensity of the organism for hematogenous dissemination, blood culture was performed to check its presence in blood, which was negative. As the organism was found to be susceptible to ofloxacin, it was continued for one week. Finally, the repeat urine culture was performed to ensure the treatment success and the urine culture did not show any growth.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Case 2 (Bacteremia)\n\n【11】A 22-year-old male road traffic accident patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, after receiving treatment for one week with no improvement in another hospital. The patient had multiple fractures with abrasion all over the body. The patient was serious but stable and had high body temperature. So, the necessary laboratory investigations were requested and the patient was put on meropenem, teicoplanin, and polymyxin B to cover all the bacterial infections including the nosocomial infections (if present), as the patient was transferred from another hospital.\n\n【12】There were no clinical and radiological evidences of visceral abscesses. The abnormal reports included low hemoglobin (9.6 gms/dL), leucocytosis (12250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) with neutrophilia (89%) and lymphocytopenia (4.2%), low packed cell volume (30.7%), and low red blood cells count (3.54 millions/mm<sup>3</sup>). The blood culture performed in BACTEC 9050 showed the growth of bacterial pathogen, which on further identification by phenotypic methods (as performed in case 1) was confirmed to be Chromobacterium violaceum . The antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique showed that the organism was susceptible to nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, meropenem, tigecycline, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin but resistant to ceftriaxone, cefepime and polymyxin B. So, on the basis of the culture report received, the treatment with meropenem was continued for one week and the patient was again screened for any infections, if present, by performing bacteriological culture of different clinical samples and all were negative.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Colonies of Chromobacterium violaceum in MacConkey agar.</u>\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【15】In Nepal, recently, the infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum have been increasingly reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–5\\]</u>. The reason for this may be either the increased rate of identification of the organism (due to development of sophisticated laboratory with skilled manpower) or the climate change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Due to temperature sensitivity of this organism, the effect of global climate change has caused Chromobacterium violaceum to spread to wider geographical location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. The organism has low virulence and is responsible for causing fatal sepsis in immunocompromised patients or in case of inappropriate antibiotic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our case, although the patients were immunocompromised, they did not develop any complications due to timely proper treatment they received.\n\n【16】The Chromobacterium violaceum infections are acquired either through oral route by consumption of contaminated water or food or due to exposure of damaged skin to contaminated soil or water (mainly stagnant or recreational water) or during surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. So, the road traffic accident patient might have got the infection through the abrasions present in his body, while chronic kidney disease patient might have got the infection due to urinary catheterization, which is also a risk factor for urinary tract infection. Similar to our study, Pant and Sharma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> from Nepal and Ma et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> from China reported the urinary tract infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum in kidney disease patients. However, Pant et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> from Nepal and Swain et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> from India reported the urinary tract infections caused by this organism in immunocompetent adults. In accordance with our case, Parajuli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported a case of bacteremia caused by Chromobacterium violaceum from Nepal which they managed with timely proper treatment, while Ansari et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported a case of fatal sepsis. Similarly, Mohan et al. reported a case of urinary tract infection caused by C. violaceum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, while Ray et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, Madi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, Karthik et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, and Kar et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> reported the cases of septicemia caused by the same organism in India. Further, Kaniyarakkal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> reported the cases of both urinary tract infection and septicemia from India.\n\n【17】Chromobacterium violaceum is known to be highly resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins but sensitive to carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 16\\]</u>. In our study also the organism isolated from the case of urinary tract infection was found to be resistant toward amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and nitrofurantoin but sensitive toward ofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, amikacin, imipenem, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Similar types of drug susceptibility patterns were also reported by Pant et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and Pant and Sharma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> in Chromobacterium violaceum isolated from two different cases of urinary tract infection. But, in contrast to our study, Swain et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reported the bacterium to be sensitive to nitrofurantoin; however, the susceptibility of the bacterium to other remaining antibiotics tested was similar to our study.\n\n【18】Similarly, in case of bacteremia patient the organism was susceptible to nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, meropenem, tigecycline, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin but resistant to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and polymyxin B. However, Parajuli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported the susceptibility of C. violaceum to cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones and resistance to polymyxin B.\n\n【19】Because of high possibility of hematogenous dissemination to visceral organs and frequent relapse, long courses of antimicrobial therapies are recommended for treatment of infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 17\\]</u> but we did not find any clinical or laboratory or radiological evidences of hematogenous spread and visceral abscesses. So, the treatment was given only for one week but a suggestion to visit hospital as soon as any suspicious symptoms appear was given to the outpatient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Similarly, the patient admitted to intensive care unit was put under strict observation for any suspicious symptoms.\n\n【20】As Chromobacterium violaceum has high tendency for hematogenous spreading causing sepsis which may cause death in as less as one week, the timely proper treatment is necessary to avoid the possible complications and hence to save patient’s life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our case, the patients did not get any complications related to Chromobacterium violaceum infection due to timely proper treatment they received.\n\n【21】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【22】The infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum may be treated successfully, if prompt proper treatment is started. For this, the clinicians should be aware of this rare but fatal infection. From Nepal, the infections caused by Chromobacterium violaceum have been increasingly reported.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Three patients manifested with normal blood pressure, recurrent hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Only case 2 had obvious hypomagnesemia. Gene sequencing showed a compound heterozygous mutation in SCL12A3 in case 1 and a homozygous mutation in SCL12A3 in case 2. Heterozygous mutations in SCL12A3 and CLCNKB were found in case 3. Then, the literature was reviewed. The keyword “Gitelman syndrome” was inputted into the PubMed, Wanfang Database, and CNK to search all Chinese patients with GS diagnosed by gene mutations and to extract complete clinical data from December 1998 to 2018. Finally, a total of 124 cases of GS were included. No significant differences in the levels of serum potassium and magnesium were observed among the different gene mutations, and the serum magnesium levels in adults were lower than those of the juvenile. GS with reduced blood magnesium had a serious clinical phenotype. Therefore, GS had a diverse phenotype, and its final diagnosis required genetic profiling. The relationship of gene mutation and clinical phenotype needed further study.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive renal tubular disease, first reported by Gitelman et al. in 1966 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. GS is caused by a mutation in the SLC12A3 gene which encodes a thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCCT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. CLCNKB mutations form the molecular basis of classical Bartter syndrome (cBS) as it encodes chloride channels in the renal tubular basement membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It was recently reported that CLCNKB mutations also cause GS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>. In this study, 36 hypokalemia-related genes were sequenced and analyzed by high-throughput second-generation sequencing in 3 patients with hypokalemia. We aimed to identify gene mutation sites that could improve disease diagnosis and treatment. We also searched full-text journals published in the PubMed, WanFang Database, and China Knowledge Network (CNK) to summarize the relationship between clinical data and mutation types.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】All 3 patients showed renal potassium loss, metabolic alkalosis, high renin activity, but normal blood pressure. The patients did not take long-term laxatives, diuretics, and other drugs, excluding secondary factors such as hyperthyroidism, primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, cortisol hypertrophy, renin tumors, or tubular acidosis.\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 23-year-old male patient was hospitalized for hypokalemia since 2 years. Two years earlier, the patient had hypokalemia due to severe diarrhea after eating unclean food. No fatigue, numbness of limbs, palpitation, or chest tightness was noted. Serum potassium was 2.77 mmol/L during a routine physical examination. The patient developed normally and is unmarried. There was no history of similar disease in the family. Consanguineous marriage was denied. After admission, a physical examination was performed: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg. The results of electrolytes at admission showed that the levels of serum potassium and serum magnesium were 2.84 mmol/L and 0.77 mmol/L, respectively. Blood gas analysis showed mild metabolic alkalosis.\n\n【8】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【9】A 41-year-old male patient was hospitalized due to elevated blood sugar levels that persisted for half a year. The patient suffered from hypokalemia for 8 years (blood potassium 2.5–2.9 mmol/L). The patient suffered from occasional feebleness and aching in both the lower limbs, which improved after potassium supplementation. There was no history of similar disease in the family. Consanguineous marriage was seen in his parents. After admission, a physical examination was conducted: blood pressure, 108/68 mmHg. The results of electrolytes at admission showed that the levels of serum potassium and serum magnesium were 2.39 mmol/L and 0.56 mmol/L, respectively. Blood gas analysis showed metabolic alkalosis.\n\n【10】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【11】A 37-year-old female patient was hospitalized for reduplicated twitching limbs for 10 years and syncope on 3 occasions. Ten years earlier, the patient suffered from limb twitching without obvious induction, which was accompanied by numbness and the twitching of both hands. Over the last 10 years, recurrent syncope occurred on three occasions. This was accompanied by sweating, a loss of consciousness, and urine incontinence. The symptoms lasted for several minutes and improved spontaneously, mostly after fatigue. In many emergency cases, the patient’s serum potassium level was 2.5–3.0 mmol/L. The 24-hour urinary calcium excretion quantitative value was 2.57 mmol, which was lower than the normal reference value. In addition, the oral hydrochlorothiazide diuretic test (HCT test) was performed in this patient as described by Colussi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The results showed that the maximum difference of chlorine excretion rate before and after HCT test was 2.1%, indicating that there was dysfunction of distal renal tubules. Moreover, the patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and failed to adhere to medication. Her deceased grandfather suffered from limb numbness and was not examined for blood potassium. Her mother suffered from limb numbness and low blood potassium levels (the specific situation is unknown), but her symptoms improved after oral potassium chloride. The elderly brothers and sisters were assessed for blood potassium which was normal on 3 occasions. One elderly sister died, the cause of death being unclear. A cousin displayed numbness of the limbs with blood potassium levels of 2.81 mmol/L. One son had no obvious numbness in his limbs, and his blood potassium was normal. A family tree is shown in Figure 1. Following admission, a physical examination was performed: blood pressure, 126/80 mmHg. The results of electrolytes at admission showed that the levels of serum potassium and serum magnesium were 3.29 mmol/L and 0.79 mmol/L, respectively. Blood gas analysis showed metabolic alkalosis.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Family tree of the case 3 families who suffer from hypokalemia. Square = male, circle = female.</u>\n\n【13】There were no abnormal blood lipids in the 3 patients including blood coagulation factors. Liver and kidney function were normal. Amongst the patients, case 2 had diabetes mellitus. The results of blood potassium, magnesium, calcium, 24-hour urine potassium, and blood gas analysis are detailed in Table 1. All 3 patients had hypokalemia, renal potassium loss, and metabolic alkalosis. Thyroid function, adrenal cortex hormones, and aldosterone were normal. Renin levels increased in all 3 cases. In addition, no obvious abnormalities in adrenal CT and pituitary MRI were observed in the 3 patients.\n\n【14】Table 1 Serum electrolytes, 24-hour urine potassium, blood gas analysis, and renin aldosterone levels of the 3 cases.\n\n【15】High-throughput second-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of the 36 hypokalemia-related genes were performed to identify possible mutation sites. Direct sequencing was used to verify the patients and their parents . In case 1, two compound heterozygous mutations in the SCL12A3 gene were identified. One originated from the father , and the other originated from the mother . Case 2 had a homozygous mutation (p.N359K) from the parents. Case 3 had two genetic mutations from the mother, including the P.T60M mutation in the SCL12A3 and P.W391R mutation in the CLCNKB gene. These are known as Bartter syndrome type III and classic Bartter syndrome mutations.\n\n【16】Table 2 Gene mutations in the 3 patients.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Literature Review\n\n【18】We inputted the keyword “Gitelman syndrome” into the PubMed, Wanfang Database, and CNK to search all Chinese articles from December 1998 to 2018. Following screening, 48 papers with detailed and complete patient data were selected. A total of 124 cases were diagnosed as GS by gene mutation analysis. The age of onset ranged from 1 year to 64 years. Amongst the patients, 25 were ≤18 years old. A total of 17 patients had normal serum magnesium.\n\n【19】Amongst the 124 cases, there were 56 compound heterozygous mutations, 28 homozygous mutations, 26 multiple mutations, and 14 single heterozygous mutations. The 124 cases included 17 frameshift mutations and 6 nonsense mutations . The detection of urinary potassium was influenced by the levels of blood potassium and whether the patients received supplementary potassium. The reference values of urinary magnesium differed between hospitals. And the difference of aldosterone renin levels was greater. We therefore compared only serum potassium and magnesium levels amongst the mutants.\n\n【20】Table 3 Comparison of blood potassium and blood magnesium levels across the different mutation types ( ± s).\n\n【21】No significant differences between the 23 cases of frameshift and nonsense mutations and the 101 cases of other mutations in terms of blood potassium and magnesium levels were observed. No significant differences in serum potassium and magnesium levels were observed amongst the groups with compound heterozygous mutations, homozygous mutations, multiple mutations, and single heterozygous mutations. There were no obvious abnormalities in serum potassium levels in the adult or juvenile groups, but the serum magnesium levels in the adult group were lower than those of the juvenile group . In addition, the average serum potassium level in the low blood magnesium group was significantly decreased compared with the normal blood magnesium group () .\n\n【22】Table 4 Comparison of serum potassium and magnesium levels in the adult and juvenile groups ( ± s).\n\n【23】Table 5 Comparison of serum potassium levels between the low blood magnesium and normal blood magnesium groups ( ± s).\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【25】GS is characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesia, hypocalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperrenin-angiotensin aldosterone, and normal or low blood pressure. It is a common tubular genetic disease caused by mutations in the SLC12A3 gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The disease is autosomal recessive inheritance, and the symptom rarely occurs before the age of six. GS is mostly diagnosed in adolescence or adulthood, and its general clinical features include muscle weakness and tetany. Mutations in the CLCNKB gene that encode the renal basement chloride channel form the molecular basis of the classical Bartter’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. GS and Bartter’s syndrome overlap according to the phenotype. Hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria are the major features of GS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, which differs from the classical Bartter’s syndrome. However, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria are not always present in patients with GS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It has been reported that the CLCNKB mutations in the classical Bartter’s syndrome cause cases similar to GS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【26】All 3 cases of hypokalemia were diagnosed in adulthood. Case 1 had no obvious myasthenia, convulsions of the hands and feet, and hypomagnesemia, but only mild metabolic alkalosis. The clinical phenotype was similar to Bartter’s syndrome. Case 2 showed occasional weakness and soreness of both lower limbs, mild hypomagnesemia, and hypochloride metabolic alkalosis. The clinical manifestations of case 3 were severe, with obvious weakness of both lower limbs, convulsion and asthenia, and syncope. Following potassium supplementation, the symptoms improved. There was no hypomagnesemia, and the 24-hour urinary calcium excretion quantitative value was significantly decreased. The clinical phenotype was similar to that of Bartter’s syndrome. The genetic analysis of cases 1 and 2 were SCL21A3 complex heterozygous mutations and homozygous mutations, respectively. All three mutation sites were previously reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. In case 3, there were two gene mutations, both from the mother. One was the p.t60m mutation in the SCL12A3 gene, and the other was the p.w391r mutation of the CLCNKB gene, which was type of gene mutation of III Barter’s syndrome. To date, the p.w391r mutation of the CLCNKB gene represents a newly discovered mutation site and a nonpolymorphic site, the incidence rates of which are low. Moreover, the mutations were not reported in the professional edition of the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). GS and Bartter’s syndrome are autosomal recessive inheritance. It was reported that chloride clearance test can effectively differentiate GS and BS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In order to further confirm whether case 3 is GS, we carried out hydrochlorothiazide load test on the patient. The results showed that the chlorine excretion rate did not increase significantly after the administration of hydrochlorothiazide. Therefore, it was preliminarily determined that the patient was GS. But further genome-wide sequencing and multiplexed probe amplification (MLPA) is required to detect large fragment deletions or duplications.\n\n【27】It has been reported that phenotypic differences exist not only in family members but also in patients with the same genetic mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Case 3 also had Graves’ disease. The thyroid function was normal during hospitalization, and no previous medication was administered. Zhou et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> summarized 17 cases of GS with autoimmune thyroid disease, including 13 cases with Graves’s disease. All 13 patients presented with hypokalemic periodic paralysis, the mechanism(s) of the occurrence of which remain unclear.\n\n【28】NCCT is expressed in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephrons and represents the major ion transport system in this region. The SLC12A3 gene is located on chromosome 16q13 and is approximately 55 kb in length with a total of 26 independent exons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The human SLC12A3 gene has been cloned and is predicted to encode a 1021 amino acid protein, that includes 12 transmembrane domains and long amino and carboxy ends. Over 100 mutations are associated with GS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>, including missense mutations, nonsense mutations, coding frameshift mutations, and shear mutations. Meanwhile, homozygous mutations are rare. A large number of heterozygous mutations have been identified. In this study, 36 genes associated with hypokalemia were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. For cases 1 and 3, complex heterozygous mutations in SCL21A3 were identified. Case 2 was a homozygous mutation. The P.T60M mutation in case 1 is the most common mutation in Asians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 17\\]</u>. The other mutations, p.l858h, were discovered by Japanese researchers in 2012 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Case 2 had a homozygous mutation, and the patient’s parents were close relatives. The mutation type was P.N359K which was reported in Chinese studies in 2009 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Case 3 had a heterozygous mutation which was more complex. Mutations of two genes were found, both from the mother, namely, p.t60m of SCL12A3 and p.w391r of CLCNKB. Interestingly, the patient’s mother also had hypokalemia. There are currently no reports of simultaneous SCL12A3 and CLCNKB mutations in the literature. Both mutations were heterozygous mutations. In Asia, the SCL12A3 P.T60M and CLCNKB P.W391R mutations are common. The CLCNKB mutation leads to the development of the classical Bartter’s syndrome, which has autosomal recessive inheritance. Although the frequency of heterozygous mutations increases with GS, other mutations may be present. The reasons are as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the mutation sites may be located in a regulatory sequence of SLC12A3 that we did not sequence, such as 5′ or 3′ untranslated regions or deep introns; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may interfere with the expression and function of NCCT; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> mutations may be located in other genes that regulate NCCT function; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> gene expression and function may be acquired 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【29】In this study, 124 cases of GS were diagnosed by gene mutational analysis with complete data and are summarized. These include 56 compound heterozygous mutations, 28 homozygous mutations, 26 multiple mutations, 14 single heterozygous mutations, 17 frameshift mutations, and 6 nonsense mutations. No significant differences in the levels of potassium or magnesium between the frameshift and nonsense mutations were observed, similar to previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Data from the Zhongshan Hospital of China showed that complex heterozygotes/homozygotes of the SLC12A3 gene have significantly lower serum potassium levels than the single heterozygotes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In this study, no significant differences in serum potassium and magnesium levels were observed in either group. This may be related to the inconsistency of the detection methods. This article is a summary of an array of cases that used different detection techniques. Some employed multiplexed probe amplification technology (MLPA) detection, resulting in a higher frequency of mutation sites in which the number of compound heterozygous mutations increased. Some of the hospitals used MLPA to detect simple heterozygous mutations with different statistical parameters. This small number of cases now requires expansion to obtain statistically accurate data.\n\n【30】Electrolyte imbalances, acid-base imbalances, and clinical manifestations occur more frequently in patients with low serum magnesium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. Amongst the 124 patients assessed in this study, 17 had normal serum magnesium, and the average serum potassium level in the low blood magnesium group was significantly decreased compared with the normal blood magnesium group. This was consistent with the more serious clinical manifestations in patients with low serum magnesium.\n\n【31】GS and the classical Bartter’s syndrome are incurable, but the prognosis is promising. However, the ion disorder in GS patients is difficult to treat and requires long-term use of a combination of medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. GS-mediated hypokalemia and metabolic disorders can be corrected with potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics. For severe cases, simultaneous magnesium supplementation is required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The treatment of Bartter’s syndrome is to correct hypokalemia and alkalosis. Potassium-preserving diuretics such as spironolactone combined with potassium chloride help to control hypokalemia over a short time period. The most effective treatment is prostaglandin synthase inhibitors such as indomethacin, aspirin, and ibuprofen. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can reduce potassium excretion by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which may be superior to spironolactone.\n\n【32】In brief, GS had a diverse phenotype, and its final diagnosis required further genetic mutation analysis. Hypokalemia caused by hereditary diseases should be considered as the possibility of GS. The relationship of gene mutation and clinical phenotype needs further study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Clinical features are heterogeneous and include fever, respiratory compromise, mucocutaneous involvement with conjunctival abnormalities and erythematous exanthem, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Neurologic and cardiovascular symptoms can also develop, including coronary artery dilatation. Some cases involve 2 or more organs and require critical admission. Echocardiography is the mainstay of cardiac evaluation in the acute setting as well as on outpatient follow-up. We present the case of a 4-month-old female with no past medical or surgical history who presented with a prolonged febrile syndrome associated with severe respiratory illness, gastrointestinal symptoms, and mucocutaneous abnormalities. Diagnosis of MIS-C was established based on clinical findings, persistently elevated markers of systemic inflammation and positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test and evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Echocardiogram evidenced myopericarditis and coronary aneurysms and patient was deemed candidate for immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), resulting in favorable clinical and paraclinical outcomes. Few cases of giant coronary aneurysms have been reported in children. There are no existing literature reports about coronary thrombosis or thrombus formation resulting from vascular aneurysmal dilations in this population. As such, the prognosis and natural history of coronary artery aneurysms in the setting of MIS-C remain largely unknown.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】COVID-19, initially known as a cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome, has represented a major challenge for those working in pediatric healthcare, where a great diversity of clinical manifestations has been documented. During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first observational studies showed that most children were asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> or were not severely affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】However, in the United Kingdom in April 2020, a potentially fatal hyperinflammatory condition was first described. This condition shared clinical characteristics with incomplete Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome, consistent of a febrile syndrome associated with mucocutaneous involvement, polymorphic rash, edema and erythema on palms and soles, coronary involvement, and elevation of inflammatory markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. This condition called Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) is recognized as a complication that generally develops 4 to 6 weeks after infection by SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, a situation suggesting that the virus may be a trigger for genetically predisposed individuals. 53–80% of them did not show positivity in the polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR), but the vast majority, from 75% to 90%, had serological positivity IgG or an epidemiological link with the infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The overall proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with MIS-C is largely unknown. Most patients do not have past medical conditions and the mean age of presentation is around 8 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Its clinical manifestations include fever, respiratory involvement in 30–70%, mucocutaneous involvement in 74%, conjunctival changes in 45–54%, erythematous rash in 52–62%, in addition, gastrointestinal manifestations such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea in 53–92%, neurological and cardiovascular symptoms in 80%. 71–90% of patients presented involvement of more than 2 organs and half of the patients require admission to the intensive care unit during their hospital stay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Cardiac complications are significant, with more than 80% of patients presenting cardiac involvement and around 10% to 40% of cases developing alterations in the coronary arteries. Among those most documented include coronary hyperechogenicity and with a lower incidence, true coronary aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u> which if not timely treated, could lead to fatal outcomes. Coronary artery aneurysm is a rare clinical entity defined by an abnormal focal dilatation of a coronary artery exceeding the adjacent normal segment in diameter by at least 1.5-fold 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The size threshold for a small aneurysm is defined by Z score ≥2.5 to <5, medium aneurysm with a Z score ≥5 to <10, and a giant aneurysm with a Z score ≥10 or ≥8 mm in diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Echocardiography is the cornerstone for evaluation of cardiac involvement in the acute phase and during follow-up. The most common findings include left ventricular dysfunction and abnormalities in coronary arteries including dilatation. Reports of giant aneurysmal alterations are not common and to date there is no information on the presence of thrombi in coronary dilatations developed in association with this condition.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Clinical Case\n\n【9】A 4-month-old female patient presented with fever. She had no significant clinical history, weighing 8 kg (ideal 6.9 kg), height 64 cm, cephalic circumference 41 cm, BMI 19.5 and nutritional classification: P/T Z score: 1.65 Overweight risk, T/E Z score: 0.05 appropriate, BMI Z score: 1.63 Overweight risk, PC Z score: -0.31 Normal. She was admitted with a prolonged febrile syndrome of 15 days, associated with severe respiratory symptoms, liquid stools, and nonpurulent bilateral conjunctival injection. Given persistence of fever, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR), and a positive molecular test for SARS-CoV-2, further laboratory analyses were significant for leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, elevated D-dimer, elevated pro-BNP, and evidence of previous infection as indicated by positive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 . As an epidemiologic link to SARS-CoV-2 infection, she had contact with her grandfather who died from COVID-19. During physical examination, she had sustained tachycardia as a sign of low output, no hypotension, and appropriate respiratory pattern without requiring ventilator or vasoactive support, without neurological involvement.\n\n【10】Table 1 Lab tests.\n\n【11】Clinical and laboratory findings met WHO criteria for MIS-C. Despite the timeframe of the febrile condition and considering the laboratory findings, immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous (2 g/kg) was indicated along with aspirin (ASA) in anti-inflammatory dosage (50 mg/kg) in addition to anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (1 mg/kg) according to the recommendations described in the literature to date. A first echocardiogram demonstrated appropriate left ventricular contractility, with myopericarditis and aneurysmal dilatations of the left and right coronary arteries . Electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation in three continuous leads, a pattern suggestive of myocarditis.\n\n【12】Table 2 Echocardiograms.\n\n【13】Two days after starting immunomodulation with IVIG, the fever resolved, so corticosteroid treatment was not deemed necessary. She presented an appropriate clinical response, was discharged from the PICU 10 days later, and was discharged from the hospital 11 days after admission with anticoagulant therapy that she was already receiving in the hospital (1 mg/kg) and ASA in antiplatelet dose; she still receives treatment to date.T\n\n【14】Echocardiograms performed during follow-up showed dilatation of the left cardiac chambers and persistence of aneurysmal dilatations. This led to a cardiac catheterization carried out 7 months after the onset of the inflammatory condition. A finding of an aneurysm in the middle third of the right coronary artery was described, measuring 9.43 mm × 5.8 mm with an image of intracoronary thrombus occupying 2/3 of the aneurysmal lumen. There was also evidence of an aneurysm in the circumflex artery, measuring 5.9 mm × 5.3 mm without evidence of thrombus .\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Cardiac catheterization: Aneurysm in the middle third of the right coronary artery, measuring 9.43 mm × 5.8 mm with an image of intracoronary thrombus occupying 2/3 of the aneurysmal lumen.</u>\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Cardiac catheterization: Aneurysm in the right coronary artery, with an image of intracoronary thrombus.</u>\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Cardiac catheterization: Intracoronary thrombus occupying 2/3 of the aneurysmal lumen in the middle third of the right coronary artery.</u>\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Cardiac catheterization: Aneurysm in the circumflex artery, measuring 5.9 mm × 5.3 mm without evidence of thrombus.</u>\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Disscusion\n\n【20】MIS-C is a severe clinical condition with significant cardiac implications that occurs as a consequence of a dysregulated inflammatory response. It typically develops several weeks after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a reported mortality of around 2% in high-income countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. In contrast, data from developing countries such as Colombia report mortality rates of 9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The incidence of cardiac biomarker elevation such as pro-BNP and troponin is 86.65% and 76.34%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, on some occasions with extremely high levels as was with our current case, correlating with severe myocardial damage comparable to that from Kawasaki disease (KD). Significantly elevated levels of ferritin, procalcitonin, and D-dimer have also been documented, as in the case described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Echocardiography has great diagnostic value when evaluating cardiovascular involvement. The main documented findings have been coronary artery dilatation by 17.83%, aneurysm by 6.85%, pericarditis by 20.97%, myocarditis by 35.97%, and myocardial dysfunction up to 68% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 12\\]</u>. Most of the described complications related to dilatation and coronary aneurysm are small with a Z score of 2–2.5, contrary to the case presented in which giant aneurysmal dilatations were found. This could probably be explained by young age, as with growth comes improved mechanical resistance of the internal elastic lamina to aneurysm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Although infrequent, 3 cases described in Atlanta (Georgia) reported giant aneurysms occurring in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, however, so far there are no reports of aneurysmal thrombus formation. Despite the important presentation of MIS-C cases described, there are no national or Latin American publications about the findings of giant aneurysms, nor their evolution or complications.\n\n【23】Echocardiography plays an important role during longitudinal surveillance after MIS-C. Studies suggest that in patients with abnormal findings such as dilatations or aneurysms, it is necessary to carry out rigorous imaging monitoring, which in this case was not possible due to the difficulties with access to healthcare. The last outpatient echocardiogram report (8 months after the presentation of this hyperinflammatory syndrome) showed persistence of giant aneurysms in the right and circumflex coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The main purpose of treatment in MIS-C is to reduce systemic inflammation to protect affected organs and reduce or prevent complications such as coronary aneurysms and death. This treatment is guided according to the clinical presentation and requires a multidisciplinary team (cardiology, infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology, and intensive care). To date, there are no randomized controlled clinical trials or comparative efficacy studies evaluating treatment strategies. This is why available guidelines are based on expert opinion, scientific societies, and previous experience with Kawasaki disease and other multisystemic disorders in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Immunomodulatory management with immunoglobulins continues to be the first choice, and has been prescribed as monotherapy or in conjunction with corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Other important interventions include administration of ASA in 58–74% of cases and anticoagulant management in 37–44%, based on the presence of serum markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The prognosis and natural history of coronary aneurysms associated with MIS-C are still uncertain. To date, reports show that even the subset patients with MIS-C requiring critical admission and/or those with severe cardiovascular involvement, recovery was seen without sequelae in 70–95% of cases. The prognostic impact on outcomes of those cases with aneurysmal thrombosis is not known, as this severe clinical presentation remains largely undescribed. This clinical entity requires further study and structured long-term follow-up due to the risk of progression of cardiac manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It has been established that in Kawasaki disease the risk of presenting thrombotic or stenotic complications is related to the size of the aneurysms; giant aneurysms (Z score ≥10) are the least likely to undergo resolution, and are associated with up to 50% risk of adverse outcomes such as thrombotic coronary occlusion, progressive stenosis requiring revascularization, or acute coronary syndrome within 30 years after the initial illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This highlights the importance of guaranteeing rigorous follow-up in order to anticipate early complications and carry out timely interventions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "fdc1dae9-3618-4456-81ac-6fa037f4e10b", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】We present four cases of adults with obstructive sleep apnea in whom positive airway pressure therapy alone failed to provide adequate oxygenation. We have previously reported the use of dual mask for ventilatory support of a patient postoperatively (Porhomayon et al. 2013). Here, we report an evaluation of the dual mask in four patients with overlap syndromes. Application of dual mask provided adequate oxygenation with lower continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) pressure levels.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Obesity is a worldwide epidemic with numerous studies reporting increases in prevalence of this serious condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is one of the common disorders of breathing and sleep disorder (BSD) in general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. OSAS is also highly prevalent in the obese population. Its prevalence is estimated to be between 2% and 25% in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Since obesity is on the rise, it is logical to assume that the incidence of unrecognized or undiagnosed sleep apnea may be even higher in both medical and surgical population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and OSAS are an example of overlap syndrome where both diseases affect nearly 10% and 5% of the adult population over 40 years of age, respectively. Both conditions may coexist in about 0.5% of the population. Patients with overlap syndromes may have a greater or more sustained sleep-related oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) desaturation than do patients with COPD with the same degree of bronchial obstruction. They have an increased risk of developing hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency when compared with OSAS alone. In patients with overlap syndromes, hypoxemia and hypercapnic induced pulmonary hypertension can be observed in the presence of mild to moderate bronchial obstruction. This is different from “usual” COPD because the two syndromes may induce much greater changes in hemodynamic and respiratory as well as neurological functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The gold standard therapy for OSAS and overlap syndrome remains CPAP or Bi-PAP therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In some conditions, CPAP/BIPAP therapy alone fails to provide satisfactory oxygenation. In these situations, O<sub>2</sub> is often added to CPAP/BIPAP mask. Severe sleep apnea may coexist with other overlap syndromes such as COPD, congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary fibrosis, neuromuscular disorders, chronic narcotic use, or central hypoventilation syndrome. They are among conditions that may need additional supplemental O<sub>2</sub> during the titration process. The aim of this study was to further evaluate the application of dual mask device in four patients in our sleep laboratory before full implementation in a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Material and Methods\n\n【6】Dual mask is a system with an adjustable port for connection of nasal cannula . The length of nasal cannula can be adjusted from outside mask by the patient. Mask is connected to a hose that contains both room airs from CPAP/BIPAP and oxygen tube. Nasal cannula dwells within the shell and is connected to an oxygen concentrator. We evaluated the efficacy of the dual mask in the sleep lab in four patients with overlap syndromes. This study was approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Mercy hospital of North Iowa, and informed consent was obtained from all patients.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Application of dual mask to patient face. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【9】##### 3.1. Case  1\n\n【10】This was a 61-year-old female with complaints of excessive fatigue, history of loud snoring, and CHF. She was on acetaminophen with codeine for shoulder pain. Her apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 53.5 in her first sleep study. During her second night of polysomnogram (PSG) for CPAP titration, she failed CPAP due to continuous desaturation and frequent apneas and hypopneas. Therefore, she was switched to BIPAP. Despite increasing BIPAP pressure to 22/18 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, she continued to have desaturation until 3 liters of O<sub>2</sub> was added to her BIPAP. O<sub>2</sub> saturation stayed in low 90s and high 80s on this setting, but the patient was nervous and unable to tolerate this pressure especially due to leakage from her full-face mask. The patient was scheduled for a second night of CPAP/BIPAP titration. Titration started with dual mask and with 2 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub> via nasal cannula. At CPAP of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, AHI was 1.2 with good patient tolerance and O<sub>2</sub> saturation .\n\n【11】Table 1 Treatment parameters and results.\n\n【12】Table 2 Treatment parameters and results/with dual mask.\n\n【13】##### 3.2. Case  2\n\n【14】This was a 51-year-old male with history of COPD and daytime fatigue. He underwent a split night PSG. His AHI was 35 with minimum desaturation in low 60s. CPAP was applied. Right away, the patient started to have central apneas; therefore, BIPAP was applied. The patient was a major mouth breather, so technician tried every full-face mask with or without chinstrap. None of them kept a good seal due to patient’s beard. Low tidal volume and events still noted due to mouth breathing. At BIPAP pressure of 15/11 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 liters of O<sub>2</sub> was applied, but it did not improve the saturation. Technician was unable to establish a final pressure due to numerous central apneas and desaturation.\n\n【15】Around 0300, dual mask with 2 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub> was applied and titration started with BIPAP of 8/4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. At BIPAP pressure of 12/8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, saturation remained in low 90s with AHI = 1.4 .\n\n【16】Table 3 Treatment parameters and results.\n\n【17】Table 4 Treatment parameters and results/with dual mask.\n\n【18】##### 3.3. Case  3\n\n【19】This was a 58-year-old male with congestive heart failure, excessive daytime somnolence, and witnessed apnea. His previous PSG was suggestive of mixed obstructive and central apneas with AHI of 44.5. He failed CPAP titration in his first sleep study due to recurrent arousal and desaturation. The patient had 4 pillows and a rolled-up towel underneath his head. BIPAP was applied at the start of the second study at an initial pressure of 8/4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The patient initially chose a medium size full-face mask but switched to a size large later on in the study due to mask leakage issues. The patient had difficulty tolerating BIPAP pressure of 20/16 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.\n\n【20】A dual mask was applied and titration started at pressure of 6/4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with 2 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub>. At the pressure of 12/8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with 3 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub>, most of abnormal respiratory events resolved. This pressure was easily tolerable, without any significant leakage .\n\n【21】Table 5 Treatment parameters and results.\n\n【22】Table 6 Treatment parameters and results/with dual mask.\n\n【23】##### 3.4. Case  4\n\n【24】This was a 68-year-old female with history of witnessed apneas and CHF. She was a chronic smoker. She was scheduled for a split night study and her AHI was 38 during the first part of sleep study with desaturations in low 70s. CPAP was applied around 2320. Pressure of 7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O was looking good until patient aroused. Subsequently, she started to have many central apneas; therefore, BIPAP was applied. At the BIPAP pressure of 14/10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub> was added and it was increased to 3 liters/min at BIPAP pressure of 18/12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. BIPAP and CPAP both failed and technician was unable to establish a final pressure due to numerous central apneas that were mainly during rapid eye movement sleep. She requested to end the study around 0200 because the mask was hurting her face. Sleep technician tried several different types of masks and a small Quattro full-face mask was used. She was a major mouth breather. The patient slept in the supine position for entire study.\n\n【25】In her second night of PSG, she was started on BIPAP titration with dual mask and 2 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub>. At the pressure of 14/10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with 3 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub>, most apneas/hypopneas and snoring resolved .\n\n【26】Table 7 Treatment parameters and results.\n\n【27】Table 8 Treatment parameters and results/with dual mask.\n\n【28】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【29】Clinicians are experiencing an ever increasing number of patients presenting with overlap syndromes to the surgical wards and operating rooms. The managements and monitoring of patients with overlap syndromes remain complicated. Both positive pressure ventilation and oxygen therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> remain the standard of care for treatment of patients with overlap syndromes. However, poor mask fit due to facial and anatomical features reduces the efficacy of such therapy in the immediate postoperative period. Alternative strategies are needed to better provide oxygen and positive pressure ventilation. A new novel device described previously in the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and now tested in our sleep laboratory may provide additional support to the surgical and medical providers.\n\n【30】Higher CPAP/BIPAP pressure can lead to higher leakage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and may increase nasal drying or congestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, cause pressure sores on the bridge of the nose, and contribute to difficulty in exhaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In current clinical practice, O<sub>2</sub> is added to CPAP/BIPAP mask usually from a small hole into the mask or to CPAP/BIPAP hose; hence, added oxygen becomes diluted by CPAP/BIPAP flow and is also subject to leakage. Therefore, patients rarely get the benefit of supplemental O<sub>2</sub>. Adding O<sub>2</sub> to the patient’s mask is not practical because it can easily get disconnected when patient changes position during sleep. This is one of the most common patients’ complaints when O<sub>2</sub> line is directly connected to the mask. Connecting an adjustable cannula to full-face or nasal mask and delivering supplemental oxygen directly to nostrils rather than bleeding it into the mask space or hose will provide higher oxygen saturation during inhalation with the help of CPAP/BIPAP pressure.\n\n【31】As demonstrated in the four cases discussed previously, we were able to use the dual mask to improve respiratory parameters in all 4 patients with OSAS and overlap syndrome.\n\n【32】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【33】The goal is to deliver supplemental O<sub>2</sub> directly to patients’ nose in order to minimize dilution and leakage and to provide higher oxygenation with minimum CPAP/BIPAP pressure. That is expected to result in lower pressure-related side effects and subsequently higher compliance rates. Also delivering both room air and O<sub>2</sub> via only one tube and one machine provides more convenience and decreases the chance of O<sub>2</sub> disconnection by patient movements.\n\n【34】#### Disclosure\n\n【35】The authors do not have any financial or personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work.

Three primary fallopian tube carcinomas, arising in a background of chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), are presented. The possible association between chronic PID and PFTC is discussed and a hypothesies linking these cancers with chronic inflammation is proposed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primary fallopian tube cancer (PFTC) is a relatively aggressive gynaecological malignancy. It accounts for 1% of all female genital malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. The aetiology of PFTC is unknown but nulliparous women and women with germ-line BRCA mutation and women in certain occupations such as smelting workers, artistic workers, hairdressers, packers, nurses, shop workers, and clerical workers appear to be at increased risk of PFTC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>. Serous papillary carcinoma is the most common histological type, accounting for >90% of the cases with these tumours. PID is very common and Chlamydia trachomatis infection is one of the most significant causes of chronic uterine tube inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Chlamydial infection has been associated with certain cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9, 10\\]</u>. This paper describes 3 cases of PFTC, clinically presenting as tuboovarian abscesses. A possible link between chronic PID and PFTC is suggested.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】Three cases of primary fallopian tube carcinomas, presenting between April 2011 and August 2013 with a clinical impression of an inflammatory tuboovarian mass, are described.\n\n【6】Case 1 is a 46-year-old Indigenous woman, admitted in April 2011 with pelvic pain. Abdominal ultrasound showed a 130 mm complex left cystic adnexal mass which was clinically considered to be a tuboovarian abscess as there was a longstanding history of PID due to Chlamydia and gonorrhoea. No free fluid was seen in the pelvis and a CA-125 was normal. Abdominal computerised tomography confirmed the adnexal lesion but showed no additional masses. She had recently been investigated for menorrhagia and her endometrial biopsy and cervical cytology had been normal. She has type 2 diabetes and hypertension. On vaginal examination a large left sided pelvic mass was felt. At laparotomy there were dense adhesions between the adnexae, uterus, and bowel. The adnexae were completely obscured by scar tissues. She underwent hysterectomy left salpingo-oophorectomy and omental biopsy. Macroscopically, the left adnexa ( mm) hands a globular tan brown cystic appearance with a thickened fleshy wall and multiple fleshy projections into the lumen . A high grade mainly solid serous carcinoma was seen in the tube microscopically . Although the fallopian tube was almost completely destroyed by scar tissue from past PID, close relationship to uninvolved and “premalignant” dysplastic tubal epithelia could be microscopically established . The ovary was not identified. The tumour appeared to be limited to the tube and was staged as TNM stage pT1A 删除1:<u>(FIGO Stage IA)</u>. The tubal cancer was regarded as a primary fallopian tubal carcinoma, for which the patient received 6 cycles of postoperative adjuvant therapy. Posttreatment restaging CT 6 weeks later was normal and serial serum CA-125 measurements remained normal. The patient is alive and apparently disease free.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) is the macroscopic image of the left fallopian tube which is totally destroyed and cystic. Fleshy white masses are noted in the wall. The upper nodular mass protrudes into the lumen of the cystically dilated haemorrhagic tube.

She also complained of intermenstrual bleeding and had previously been treated for PID due to Chlamydia. Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy in 2010 revealed no pathology and her cervical cytology was also normal. CT abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral adnexal cysts with the right measuring 120 mm and the left measuring 102 mm. Fluid-filled tubal structures were noted in close proximity of the cystic lesions on both sides. Some of the right-sided cysts communicated directly with the fallopian tube. There was also a heterogeneous thick-walled cystic lesion in the vicinity of the right-sided fluid-filled tube. These were interpreted as inflammatory collections. CA-125 was markedly elevated at 1900 kU/L (reference range < 35 kU/L). She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In view of her clinical status and the presence of adhesions, temporary large bowel enterostomy and peritoneal washings were also performed. Macroscopic examination showed a uterus, cervix, tubes, and ovaries, 266 gm. The uterine corpus contained multiple leiomyomas but the cervix appeared unremarkable. The left ( mm) and right ( mm) adnexae were distorted by cystic lesions. Both tubes also had multiple tan and brown polypoid luminal areas . Histologically, a high grade serous cystadenocarcinoma, originating from the right fallopian tube and involving both adnexal regions and greater omentum , was identified. PID was also identified. No normal ovarian tissue was recognised. The cervix, endometrium, and myometrium showed no malignancy. The peritoneal washings revealed inflammatory material only. The tumour was staged as INM pT3aNXMX 删除1:<u>(FIGO Stage IIIA)</u>. She received chemotherapy and is being followed up with no evidence of disease recurrence clinically or by CA-125 levels.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | (a) is the macroscopic image of the left fallopian tube which shows a cross section of sausage-like white fleshy mass within what appears to be part of the tube.

She had a history of chronic PID due to Chlamydia. Ultrasound examination confirmed bilateral hydrosalpinx and also a large uterine mass. Her CA-125, CA-19.9, and CEA were normal. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and peritoneal washings were performed. Macroscopically, the uterus contained a somewhat polypoid endometrial lesion 62 mm and several small leiomyomas up to 15 mm 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c))</u>. The right adnexa, which weighed 252 g and measured  mm, consisted of a cystic mass filled with creamy material. The cystic tubal wall ranged in thickness from 1 mm to 4 mm. A polypoid yellowish tan lesion  mm was seen on the inner surface of the right tube, Figure 3(a). The left adnexa consisted of tuboovarian tissue  mm with a recognisible ovary  mm. The tube was dilated and filled with haemorrhagic fluid. Multiple septae ranging from 5 mm to 25 mm in length were seen inside the left tube 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b))</u>. The uterine lesion was a FIGO grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma. The tumour had extended into the outer myometrium but was clear by 2.5 mm. The endocervix was also involved by carcinoma 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c))</u>. The tumour expressed vimentin and oestrogen receptor 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c))</u>. CD10 was expressed only in the stroma of the normal endometrium 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c))</u> and CA126 along the luminal border of the malignant glands 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. The right tube showed xanthomatous salpingitis 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. The mucosal nodule was a high grade endometrioid carcinoma 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u> which had a similar immunohistochemical profile to the uterine tumour in being oestrogen receptor positive. Vimentin was also positive. CD10 was non contributory and CA125 was expressed along the luminal surface of the malignant glands. In addition, the right tubal epithelial lining also showed high grade dysplasia 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. The dysplastic epithelium also expressed vimentin, oestrogen receptor, and luminal surface CA125. Both tubes also showed features of hydrosalpynx. The inflammatory process in the left tube was nonspecific 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b))</u> in comparison to the xanthomatous inflammation in the right tube, as previously mentioned 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. Close examination of the epithelial lining of the left tube showed focal atypia 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b))</u>. The was no malignancy in the left tube. The right tubal cancer was limited to the tube without penetration of the serosal surface (TNM stage pT1/FIGO stage IA). Indeed the tubal tumour did not show any mural invasion 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. In view of the fact that the endometrioid cancer was at a higher stage, the patient was treated as having a TNM stage pT2a/Figo stage IIA. Her follow-up CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were unremarkable. The serum CA125 measurement has been normal since surgery.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | (a) The upper left panel is the macroscopic image of the right fallopian tube which is markedly distended and shows a polypoid mucosal mass (right tube).

Discussion\n\n【13】PFTC accounts for 1% of all gynaecological malignancies. In order to be considered a primary neoplasm, the tumour must be located within the fallopian tube or its fimbriated end and the uterus and ovary must either not contain carcinoma or if they do it must be clearly different from the fallopian tube lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The 3 cases presented here fulfill these criteria and are therefore considered primary fallopian tube cancers. The third case is complicated by the fact that a clinically significant primary tumour of the endometrium was also found and the operation was performed for the uterine complaints with the fallopian tube pathology being an incidental finding. The tubal tumour was considered a second primary as it formed a polypoid mucosal lesion 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a) left upper panel)</u> with precancerous changes in the mucosa at the base of the polyp 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a) middle panels)</u>. The tumour was associated with xanthomatous salpingitis 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a) middle and right upper panels)</u>. The tumour and the precancerous change were endometrioid expressing vimentin and oestrogen receptor (left and middle lower panels). The nonneoplastic tubal tissue did express oestrogen receptor weakly but was not vimentin positive (left and middle lower panels). CA125 was seen only along the luminal surface aspect of the normal, preneoplastic, and neoplastic epithelia (Lower right panel). The endometrial carcinoma showed a similar immunohistochemical profile 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c))</u>. The left tube 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b))</u> was not involved by cancer but foci of atypia were seen in the lining mucosa 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b) lower panels)</u>. The tube, however, did show features of hydrosalpinx 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b) upper panels)</u> with chronic salpingitis 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b) middle and lower panels)</u>. The tumour in the first 2 cases was of the serous type  and in each case, precancerous changes could be demonstrated in the tube .\n\n【14】Mounting evidence indicates that the vast majority of epithelial ovarian carcinomas are not ovarian in origin. Extrauterine Müllerian epithelium from various sites in the reproductive tract accounts for the diverse morphology and behaviour of these tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomies in BRCA positive women have recently implicated the fimbria as a site of origin for high-grade serous carcinoma and its intraepithelial precursors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. Kurman et al. has proposed a model for the development of ovarian and extraovarian low-grade serous proliferations. They postulate that all of these lesions are derived from papillary tubal hyperplasia, which appears to be induced by chronic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Chronic inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of human cancers. The mechanisms underlying the relationship between inflammation and cancer are complex. The aetiology of the inflammation is varied and includes microbial, chemical, and physical agents. The chronically inflamed environment which is rich in inflammatory cytokines appears to lead to the activation of a number of signalling pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of cancer of the proximal stomach, liver, and uterine cervix with helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and C, and human papilloma viruses, respectively, is well documented. An association between chronic inflammation and fallopian tube cancer has been suggested by a number of investigators. Lin and colleagues found an association between PID and ovarian cancer and suggested that PID might be a useful marker for ovarian cancer as early detection and treatment could help to improve prognosis. They raised the possibility that pelvic inflammation might accelerate the growth of ovarian cancers or affect cancer-cell differentiation in ways that adversely alter prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Rasmussen et al. found that a history of PID was associated with an increased risk of ovarian borderline tumours and suggested that inflammation could be an etiological factor in borderline tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> and Skapinyecz et al. also found that patients suffering from PID had a higher risk of cervical cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydial and gonorrhoeal infections can damage the tubal mucosa. A 60 kDa heat shock protein is believed to be an important triggering pathogenic immune response in chlamydial infection and several studies have demonstrated a correlation between the level of immune response to this chlamydial protein and the extent of tubal damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Chlamydia trachomatis infection is one of the most significant causes of PID. The pathogen is highly prevalent in the cervix and uterine tubes of sexually active women. The probability of having ovarian cancer has been shown to be 90% greater in women with the highest levels of antibodies to chlamydia compared to women with the lowest levels, suggesting that past or chronic persistent chlamydial infection may be a risk factor for ovarian cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. This possible association was recently revived by J. P. Carvalho and F. M. Carvalho who hypothesised that chlamydial trachomatis infection might be involved in fimbrial carcinogenesis. Fimbrial intraepithelial precursors can evolve into high grade serous carcinomas that spread rapidly to the ovarian surface and peritoneum; such tumours may appear to be primary ovarian neoplasms, though in reality, they are secondary malignancies. J. P. Carvalho and F. M. Carvalho did not offer intracellular signalling pathways for their hypothesis. This hypothesis may have implications for patient management as salpingectomy instead of oophorectomy which may be more appropriate surgery for high risk women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The 3 patients presented here had long standing histories of PIC with many hospital admissions for septic conditions and menstrual irregularities. Chlamydia with or without other infections is usually present in pelvic inflammatory disease and the 3 patients had been previously treated for chlamydial infections. Chlamydia is the most frequently reported notifiable condition in Australia. In 2011 there were almost 80,000 new notifications for persons aged 15 years and over 435 cases per 100,000 population and 9% of chlamydia notifications were among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, despite this population representing just 2.5% of the total population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The notification rate for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population was nearly four times that of the non-Indigenous notification rate: 1,257 per 100,000, compared with 340 per 100,000, respectively. Similar to the non-Indigenous population, around 80% of chlamydia diagnoses were among those aged 15 to 29 years. In 2010, more than a third (36%) of all gonorrhoea diagnoses were among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The rate of diagnosis was more than 26 times that for the non-Indigenous population: 804 per 100,000, compared with 30 per 100,000, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The 3 patients presented here are from the northern territory of Australia which has a population of approximately 230,000 with 32% being Indigenous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. PID is a significant health problem in this cohort and the finding of 3 cases of PFTC is significant and raises the possibility of an association between these cancers and PID.\n\n【17】The role of chlamydial infection is firmly established in conjunctival cancers including marginal zone lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>. As chronic chlamydial infection is the most common causes of chronic uterine tube inflammation, this infection is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of tubal cancer. It is reasonable to suggest that chronic C. trachomatis infection may be involved in fimbrial carcinogenesis and subsequent serous carcinomas with the potential for rapid spread to the ovarian surface and peritoneum. This has implications for possible early detection and prophylactic salpingectomy instead of oophorectomy in high risk women.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Hallermann–Streiff syndrome (HSS) is a rare congenital abnormality involving multiple craniofacial malformations, such as micrognathia, prominent frontal and nasal bones, vision defects, and dental anomalies, which can result in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The aim of the present study was to report a case of nasal obstruction in an individual with Hallermann–Streiff syndrome who had never breathed through the nose during treatment for lower limb lymphedema involving cervical lymphatic therapy. Case Report. An 18-year-old female adolescent with a diagnosis of HSS was sent from the genetics service of a teaching school for the treatment of lower limb lymphedema. At around 11 years of age, the patient began to present edema in the left leg, accompanied by broadening of the face and neck. The patient reported having obstructed nostrils and breathing through the mouth her entire life. On the second day of treatment, the patient reported being able to breathe through one of the nostrils, this had never occurred before. Based on this finding, the decision was made to include linear facial lymphatic drainage using the Godoy method, which led to the complete resolution of the nasal obstruction in the first 15 minutes of treatment. Nasal obstruction in children with Hallermann–Streiff syndrome may be caused by lymphedema. Conclusion. A specific lymphatic drainage technique, such as cervical lymphatic therapy and facial linear lymphatic therapy, can resolve the obstruction and maintain the nostrils unblocked for months.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hallermann–Streiff syndrome (HSS) is a rare congenital abnormality involving multiple craniofacial malformations, such as micrognathia, prominent frontal and nasal bones, vision defects, and dental anomalies, which can result in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. When severe (apnea-hypopnea index: ≥30), noninvasive treatment options may be insufficient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The genetic cause of this developmental disorder is unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Individuals with HSS have clinical characteristics that overlap with some progeroid syndromes belonging to the category of laminopathies, such as Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome and mandibuloacral dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The condition is immediately recognized by a characteristic facial gestalt with a small face, prominent forehead, narrow nose, and micrognathia. Conventional cytogenetic studies have revealed normal chromosomes in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Hereditary dental conditions associated with disorders during the development of the teeth can cause shortened roots. Short roots constitute a rare developmental anomaly in permanent dentition, the etiology of which is not well established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Craniofacial deformities, which are found in 98-99% of cases of HSS, are the main anomalies in affected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Lymphedema in individuals with HSS has not been described in the literature. The Godoy treatment method for lymphedema employs several therapeutic strategies, one of which is an intensive treatment, which enables reducing the volume of the edema by approximately 50% in five days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The aim of the present study was to report the case with an important improvement of nasal obstruction in an individual with Hallermann–Streiff syndrome during treatment for lower limb lymphedema involving cervical lymphatic therapy.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【8】An 18-year-old female adolescent with a diagnosis of HSS was sent from the genetics service of a teaching school for the treatment of lower limb lymphedema. The mother reported that the patient was born with HSS, had been submitted to surgery for the treatment of aortic stenosis at four months of age, and had been in follow-up with physicians throughout the years of the evolution of the syndrome. At around 11 years of age, the patient began to present edema in the left leg, accompanied by broadening of the face and neck. The patient reported having obstructed nostrils and breathing through the mouth her entire life. She also had difficulty raising her arms and combing her hair.\n\n【9】The physical examination revealed clinical stage II lymphedema of the left lower limb beginning at the thigh, difficulty raising the arms and moving the neck, short neck, hardened region in the subcutaneous tissue of the face, and less hardened in the forehead region. The evaluation was made for lymphedema initially and after five days with multisegmented bioimpedance and volumetry by displacement water. Perimetric evaluation of the face was not performed, because the patient reported being able to breathe through one of the nostrils after cervical lymphatic therapy and linear facial lymphatic drainage, Figure 1, this had never occurred before.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Facial lymphatic drainage (linear movements) and (b) cervical lymphatic therapy Godoy method®.</u>\n\n【11】Intensive treatment for lymphedema was proposed using the Godoy Method for five days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Treatment consisted of eight hours/day of mechanical lymphatic therapy, 15 minutes/day of cervical lymphatic therapy, body, and facial manual lymphatic drainage, and the use of a laced, hand-crafted, nonelastic (grosgrain fabric) stocking as compression therapy.\n\n【12】On the second day of treatment, the patient reported being able to breathe through one of the nostrils, this had never occurred before. Based on this finding, the decision was made to include linear facial lymphatic drainage using the Godoy method®, which led to the complete resolution of the nasal obstruction in the first 15 minutes of treatment.\n\n【13】The mother reported that the patient’s face had become thinner with treatment, which was confirmed by the comparison of photographs. The face had previously been thin and increased in volume after 11 years of age.\n\n【14】The patient has been in treatment for two years and her breathing has remained within the standards of normality for more than four months. When the obstruction recurs, a single session of cervical lymphatic therapy is sufficient to normalize her breathing and maintain it for months. An important improvement was also found with regard to motor aspects, as the patient was able to raise her arms and comb her hair, which was something she had not able been to do prior to treatment.

Discussion\n\n【16】The present study describes an unexpected finding of the resolution of nasal obstruction in an adolescent with Hallermann–Streiff syndrome who had never previously breathed through the nose. The primary objective was to treat lower limb lymphedema, which has not previously been reported in this syndrome. The initial improvement in nasal breathing through one of the nostrils led us to include a specific nasal lymphatic drainage technique based on linear movements, which led to the resolution of the obstruction of both nostrils in approximately 10 minutes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. The most gratifying aspect was to see the patient’s joy at being able to breathe through her nose. She concluded five days of intensive lymphedema treatment, which reduced the volume of the lower limb edema by 50%, and has had unobstructed nostrils for approximately two years.\n\n【17】The hypothesis for the broadening of the face and neck at 11 years of age is the lymphatic deficiency in the region that led to the development of lymphedema. The nasal obstruction since birth may have become aggravated over time. One of the routine techniques employed during intensive lymphedema treatment is cervical lymphatic therapy, which enables a reduction in facial fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–16\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Breathing difficulty is a common finding in reports of HSS, suggesting the possibility of lymphedema. Therefore, the present case points to a novel treatment prospect that could alleviate this type of problem.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】Nasal obstruction in children with Hallermann–Streiff syndrome may be caused by lymphedema. A specific lymphatic drainage technique, such as cervical lymphatic therapy and facial linear lymphatic therapy, can resolve the obstruction and maintain the nostrils unblocked for months.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This zone of mandibular rest has been mapped using physiologic parameters of muscle activity and incisal spatial kinematics. This case study expands on previous research by monitoring incisal and posterior jaw position and includes lateral pterygoid muscle activity, thus allowing for determining the spatial range including additional relevant coordinates and muscle activity. Four positions were evaluated: a maximum physiologic open position, a maximum physiologic closed position, physiologic rest position, and maximum physiologic protrusion position. Within the physiologic zone of rest formed by these 4 positions, the vertical and anterior borders of the envelope of function may be documented for the incisal and posterior mandible in true 3-dimensional fashion to assist the clinician in determining a physiologic interocclusal freeway space and vertical dimension of occlusion. Advantages and limitations are discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Clinical application of a maxillomandibular orthopedic relationship including nerves, muscles, ligaments, dental occlusion, and both temporomandibular joints for optimal function can be challenging. However, failure to consider these basic dynamic elements of dental occlusion in providing temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) treatment may result in a functional compromise. Functional compromise may either predispose or ultimately lead to muscle pathology, destruction of the dentition, supporting structures and/or the temporomandibular joints. Even mild forms of compromise result in dysfunction of the neuromuscular apparatus and associated structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In an age that demands evidence-based care, combining objective measurements of physiologic and anatomic components is a natural evolution from treatment based on subjective and mechanical concepts, to computer-assisted technologies when seeking objective answers to complex physiologic functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Mandibular Posture\n\n【6】Posture may be defined as the relative position of the various parts of the body with respect to the egocentric coordinate system, the exocentric coordinate system, and the geocentric coordinate system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Postural control involves the meaningful integration of many different neural systems that control postural components, including those associated with cognition. The mechanical problem of maintaining the posture of any single region of the body is that there are profound effects on proximal and distal regions.\n\n【7】The orientation of any body part, such as the mandible, may be described in terms of these frameworks and it reflects a dynamic process.\n\n【8】The habitual postural position of the mandible when at rest in the upright position and the condyles are in a neutral unstrained position in the mandibular fossae is also called “postural position” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Anatomical rest position, or loose packed position, for the TMJ is with the mouth slightly open so the teeth are not in contact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Through the use of surface electromyography (SEMG), muscle activity of the masticatory system can be objectively measured. The repeatable postural range at minimum baseline SEMG levels has been shown to be consistent with physiologic rest position and jaw posture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Physiologic rest of the mandible, therefore, may be defined as the minimum amount of muscle activity required to maintain anatomical rest.\n\n【10】To achieve physiologic rest, the masticatory and cervical muscles must be balanced and coordinated with respect to left and right sides and the muscles of the posterior neck must be in balance with the anterior cervical muscles. This represents a stable mandibular position concurrent with a stable head position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u> as only a few millimeters of increased inter-occlusal distance may influence a large reduction of masticatory muscle activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore, interocclusal distance and muscle activity are intimately related and physiologically relevant. The postural range of the mandible should be a repeatable zone where the mandible may return allowing the investing musculature to function from physiologic rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Additional research supporting SEMG clinical techniques in dentistry are numerous and conveniently provide guidelines where SEMG may be employed within treatment approaches including appliance therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–19\\]</u>, orthodontic intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–24\\]</u>, and dentures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Surface Electromyography (SEMG) and Jaw Kinematics in Determining a Mandibular Postural Position\n\n【13】Through the use of incisal based, magnetic kinematic technology and SEMG, Mazzocco et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> proposed a clinical protocol by which an incisal vertical physiologic envelope may be mapped in the TMD patient .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Adapted and modified from \\[26, page 9\\]. SEMG of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MM), temporalis posterior (TP), and suprahyoid (DA) sites in combination with incisal spatial kinematics. “Maximum physiologic opening” or the bottom of the physiologic zone (incisal position 1) was determined when the suprahyoid activity was above what was determined as normal levels. The top of the zone or “maximal physiologic closing” (incisal position 3) was determined when elevator activity increased to greater than what was determined as physiologic normal levels. Physiologic rest (incisal position 2) position after 45–60 minutes of ULF-TENS. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【15】A postural envelope defines the limits of stability in space in all directions. As long as the sway envelope stays within the limits of stability, balance is maintained. If sway exceeds these limits, strategies involving neighboring regions must be employed to regain balance. If an individual’s center of gravity is more anterior, posterior, or lateral than center, a smaller sway envelope is tolerated before losing balance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. The demand of neighboring systems then increases to remain within this smaller physiologic envelope. Therefore, if mandibular rest position or mandibular postural sway exceeds the zone of the physiologic resting range, a combined strategy including those of neighboring regions (e.g. the cervical spine, etc.), must be incorporated in an effort to maintain stability. Unfortunately, once the system’s adaptive capacities have been surpassed, pathology would ultimately develop.\n\n【16】A stable, physiologic occlusion would consider the spatial position from which the postural resting position of the mandible is maintained within a spatial zone that offers relatively minimal, balanced muscle activity in order to be able to provide symmetrical and prompt activation of the jaw musculature as the teeth are brought into occlusion, where maximal muscle recruitment is available and where the mandible may return to the physiologic resting range promptly and symmetrically.\n\n【17】Previous clinical works have been limited to incisal vertical dimension and lack documentation of posterior jaw position and an anterior boundary. Knowledge of the anterior border would enable clinicians to establish a jaw position within a boundary which, if exceeded, would require the neighboring systems to accommodate to maintain stability. Furthermore, posterior mandibular position is also of great importance as loss of posterior occlusal support leads to noticeable cranial condyle movement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u> as well as significantly altered effects on cervical muscle activity and spinal curvature with asymmetrical posterior occlusal support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Therefore, it would enable the clinician to objectively ascertain if the chosen mandibular position from the anterior and posterior coordinates is within vertical and anterior physiologic boundaries.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Lateral Pterygoid\n\n【19】The concept that disturbance to the activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles plays an important role in the etiology of TMD and is widely accepted; however, there is a dearth of scientific evidence to support this clinical notion and the role of the lateral pterygoid muscle in normal function remains controversial.\n\n【20】Motor unit studies at computer tomography confirmed that sites demonstrate and confirm that the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid (IHLP) and the superior head of the lateral pterygoid (SHLP) are active during opening, protrusion, and contralateral jaw movements, while a minority of SHLP were active during closing movements. These percutaneous results also provide clinically valuable information and have demonstrated that the SHLP and IHLP were minimally active when the jaw was in the clinically determined postural jaw position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31–33\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The presence of elevated activity in the lateral pterygoid muscle at resting jaw posture may be of clinical significance in that variations in the level of lateral pterygoid muscle activity could influence and/or assist in determining the anterior positioning of the condyle in relation to the disc and eminence, as well as the positioning of the jaw at postural position.\n\n【22】Through the works of Hiyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34, 35\\]</u> and Thomas, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u> it has been shown that through intraoral recording techniques, it may be possible to monitor the activity of the lateral pterygoids using surface electrodes. Although the nature of the surface electrode disallows distinction between the activities of the superior and inferior heads of the lateral pterygoid muscles, this provides tremendous promise for clinical purposes.\n\n【23】In this case study, the physiologic window of postural rest position inclusive of anterior and posterior mandibular position relative to the maxilla and muscle activity of the intraoral lateral pterygoid placement was explored.\n\n【24】#### 5\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【25】Case study design including a 43 year old male with normal occlusion, with temporomandibular dysfunction. The subject was a unilaterally involved combined myogenous and arthrogenous patient (groups I and II according to RDC/TMD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u> and reported moderate to severe muscular pain at rest and during mandibular movements on the right side; pain was also associated with palpation of the TMJ area. Pain was classified as grade I-II according to the chronic pain classification scale (low disability with low to high intensity pain). Clicking (in opening/closing) or articular crepitus, on the right side were subjectively found.\n\n【26】Additional objective data included right joint sounds analysis that revealed possible crepitus, adhesions, scarring, and degenerative issues. Imaging results revealed slight osteogenic degeneration, sclerosis, and posterior and superior displacement of the right condyle.\n\n【27】SEMG data was collected from the bilateral temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), and suprahyoid (DIG) sites using pregelled bipolar Ag/AgCl surface electrodes (Noraxon USA) with a diameter of 1 cm and an interelectrode distance of 2 cm center to center, parallel to muscle fiber direction over the muscle belly as recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. The reference electrode was placed on the C-7 spinous process. All SEMG electrode sites were rigorously abraded and cleansed with sterile alcohol prep pads prior to electrode placement.\n\n【28】The activity of the bilateral lateral pterygoid (LP) sites was recorded intraorally by way of surface electrodes per Hiyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34, 35\\]</u>. The electrodes used were a small Ag/AgCl surface electrode Blue Ambu N with a monitoring area of 15/28 mm<sup>2</sup> and a decentralized snap. The electrodes were trimmed and adhered to reach an interelectrode distance of approximately 1 cm and secured on the mucosa in the buccal vestibule distal to the maxillary tuberosity with an adhesive. Prior to electrode placement, the mucosal tissue was dried using a standard paper towel and then cleaned with a sterile alcohol prep pad.\n\n【29】All SEMG data was collected with a telemetry device, preamplified and band-pass filtered in hardware between 20 and 500 Hz (Noraxon USA) with input impedance greater than 100 Mohms and sampled at 1000 Hz with an overall gain of 1000. Data was rectified and smoothed at 100 ms (movag) in WinNMBite software (Zebris GmbH).\n\n【30】Spatial analysis of the lower jaw was determined in conjunction with SEMG using the Jaw Motion Analysis system (JMA) from Zebris Medical GmbH . The JMA system has been determined to be accurate for recording and evaluating jaw motion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39–41\\]</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Jaw Motion Analysis system mounted on subject. Courtesy of Zebris Medical GmbH. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【32】The JMA utilizes ultrasonic sensors attached to a light head frame (approximately 3.9 ounces) and emitters (weight—approximately 10 grams) that were attached to the mandibular dentition via Stomahesive (Convatec Inc). The resolution of the ultrasonic path is approximately 0.085 mm with a maximum sampling rate of 200 Hz (sampling rate was 75 Hz for the case study).\n\n【33】Documentation of the subject’s maxillary right and left distobuccal molars and the incisal points were determined using the pointer system. The lower jaw is then referenced to these three points in space. These coordinates used are relative to the maxillary plane and provide incisal and posterior mandibular coordinates relative to the maxilla.\n\n【34】The subject was seated upright comfortably in a straight-back chair without head support, with the Frankfurt occlusal plane parallel to the floor. After SEMG electrode placement was completed, baseline/postural resting values of each site were recorded .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | SEMG activity of the bilateral temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS) suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoids (LP) at the initial baseline/postural resting position (Pre-TENS). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【36】Following the baseline recording, the subject was instructed on how to perform a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for the masseter, temporalis anterior, and pterygoids. SEMG baseline/postural data of the temporalis anterior and masseter sites were normalized to their corresponding mean SEMG values recorded during a two second maximal clench. With the teeth apart where maxillary and mandibular incisal position was even, a recording during a 2 second maximally resisted protrusive effort was performed . SEMG baseline/postural data of the lateral pterygoid sites were normalized to their corresponding mean SEMG values recorded during the two second maximum resisted protrusion effort.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Recorded during jaw protrusion against resistance while the teeth are separated.

Following application of ULF-TENS, (Dolotens, Neuromuscular Technologies, Inc.) for 25 minutes, the subject was seated in a comfortable head-supported upright position with the Frankfort horizontal plane parallel to the floor and an additional baseline recording was taken to ensure that relaxation of all muscles was achieved .

The first spatial position/border, “maximum physiologic opening” was identified based upon SEMG parameters using similar methods described by Lynn and Mazzocco  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Maximum physiologic opening was obtained by having the subject slowly open the mouth until suprahyoid or lateral pterygoid SEMG activity demonstrated a consistent elevation in excess of physiologic rest activity.

Maximum physiologic closure was obtained by having the subject to slowly close the mouth until it was determined that the elevator muscle activity (masseter, temporalis anterior, or lateral pterygoids) demonstrated a consistent elevation in excess of physiologic resting activity and greater than 2% of their MVC. The threshold of 2% was chosen based on previous work that demonstrated a mathematical calculation of normal subjects having a resting baseline of less than 2% of MVC for the mandibular elevators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Acceptable baseline amplitudes, may be operationally defined as less than a 1% to 2% MVIC amplitude for tasks that are functionally performed for about 1 hour or longer (e.g. posture of the mandible) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>.

Results\n\n【49】Spatial position for incisal, right and left posterior jaw positions relative to their corresponding physiologic positions are presented in Table 1.\n\n【50】Table 1 Summary of associated mandibular coordinates relative to physiologic parameters, determined by simultaneous monitoring of masticatory muscle activity.\n\n【51】Physiologic rest was spatially determined when all elevator muscle levels were at relatively minimal levels and balanced. Incisal vertical demonstrated the greatest discrepancy. When establishing a spatial position of “maximal physiologic opening”, the suprahyoids demonstrated an initial elevation in activity in 2 of the 3 efforts. The 2nd effort demonstrated a simultaneous response of the right lateral pterygoid and suprahyoids. When establishing a spatial position of “maximal physiologic closing”, the lateral pterygoids consistently demonstrated a bilateral elevation in activity prior to the temporalis anterior and masseter recording sites in all 3 trials. When establishing a spatial position of maximal physiologic protrusion, the right lateral pterygoid site was consistently the first to demonstrate an elevation in activity over all muscles, in all 3 trials.\n\n【52】#### 7\\. Discussion\n\n【53】As previously indicated, once adaptive capacities have been surpassed, pathology develops. This is obvious within the masticatory and associated structures. Shortened muscles can initiate pain by affecting intramuscular nociceptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u> or through metabolic effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. As muscles shorten, tension increases and concurrent mechanical stress and pain may be induced by additional tension on tendons, joints, ligaments, as well as occlusion of the vascular bed prohibiting metabolic turnover. Tenderness within these tissues contributes to the sensitization of the associated neurons lowering the pain threshold. This nociceptive input arises from muscular hypertonicity and fatigue. Therefore, treatment directed towards muscle components that limit muscle hypertonicity can decrease pain related to the dysfunction present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【54】In the case study presented, each spatial position was documented when there was evidence of muscle activity above clinically acceptable baseline levels (hypertonicity). Therefore, the resting physiologic envelope of postural jaw function in this subject would be slightly superior to maximal physiologic opening, slightly inferior to maximal physiologic closing, and posterior to maximal physiologic protrusion, and it approximates the computed trajectory to be within a physiologic muscular position .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 10 | Spatial position of the lower jaw combined with bilateral activity of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoid (LPT) sites. Coordinates listed are representative of mandibular position relative to centric occlusion and physiologic rest, maximal physiologic opening (position 1), maximal physiologic closing (position 2), and maximal physiologic protrusion (position 3). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【56】The data would suggest that in this subject, an increase in vertical dimension may be considered to be compatible within the physiologic range. The vertical dimension compared to anterior/posterior positioning may require the largest change to reach a homeostatic state with mild differences between right and left posterior mandibular positions. If vertical dimension changes were to be considered on this subject, the vertical dimension would allow relatively moderate changes (less than 3.6 mm left and 3.3 mm right posterior jaw positions, resp.) and suggest mild changes in 3-dimensions to the subject’s right in 3 of the 4 positions documented. Also, any anterior change may be limited in this subject as all positions were less than a millimeter anterior to CO to be within the physiologic range. These data suggest that the vertical dimension of both the anterior and posterior jaw may endure the greatest change, where the anterior/posterior range is much more sensitive to change.\n\n【57】Furthermore, it was found that in establishing the resting physiologic envelope, during maximal physiologic closing, the lateral pterygoid sites, not investigated in previous studies, were consistently found to be responsive prior to prime mover sites (temporalis anterior or masseter). During maximal physiologic protrusion, the lateral pterygoid consistently demonstrated earlier activation than any other site, and during maximal physiologic opening, it was found to be elevated approximately 30% of the time concurrent with the suprahyoid sites.\n\n【58】This information presents a number of appealing implications as follows.通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>This physiologic resting range of the anterior and posterior mandibular positions may be documented utilizing jaw motion analysis (e.g. Zebris Medical GmbH) when combined with SEMG. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>The vertical physiologic envelope may be smaller than previously suggested in TMD subjects. The function and activity of the lateral pterygoid suggest that this may be the limiting factor. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>The anterior border (maximum physiologic protrusion) may be documented if concurrent lateral pterygoid activity is recorded. 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>Caution should be exercised if jaw positioning is considered anterior to a trajectory created by TENS if the lateral pterygoid activity is not measured.通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>Intraoral lateral pterygoid recordings may lend important information in the construction of “pull-forward” appliances for sleep apnea patients to ensure the chosen appliance and/or position is within the physiologic range.通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>Establishing the physiologic borders through the combined use of SEMG and posterior jaw position during a bite registration procedure may allow the clinician to objectively document the range of physiologic rest of the anterior and posterior lower jaw in the vertical and anterior dimensions. Theoretically, this would allow the clinician to ensure the chosen bite registration position is within physiologically tolerable limits, thereby lessening the amount of adaptation that would be required. Within the physiologic zone of rest formed by these 4 positions, the vertical and anterior borders of the envelope of function may be documented for the incisal and posterior mandible in true 3-dimensional fashion to assist the clinician in determining a physiologic interocclusal freeway space and vertical dimension of occlusion.\n\n【59】This and previous works demonstrated tremendous promise for clinical applications for intraoral SEMG of the lateral pterygoid sites if commercially available customized miniature intraoral surface electrodes became available and an established electrode placement protocol based on verified CT sites is tested more thoroughly for clinical applications. Should these parameters be met, use of surface electromyography of the lateral pterygoids would provide noninvasive, functionally diagnostic treatment information not attainable by other means.\n\n【60】In the computed trajectory, one limitation is that functional anatomy dictates that the mandible does not move in a straight line. Therefore, it is seemingly intuitive that any sort of computer generated trajectory is an approximation and the addition of SEMG may be necessary to ensure that any chosen treatment position is within physiologic parameters.\n\n【61】Furthermore, there are obvious biomechanical implications related to the cranial-skeletal system that should be considered. Cranial asymmetries are not uncommon, often associated with craniofacial asymmetries, as well as cerebral asymmetries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49–51\\]</u>. In view of the fact that the masticatory muscles have attachments to the cranium, if asymmetries or skeletal anomalies exist, muscles are disallowed a biomechanically symmetrical alignment among homologous pairs, predisposing them to dysfunction. Without initially correcting these biomechanical issues, treatment success is likely to be limited with or without the technique or technologies presented.\n\n【62】The author acknowledges some clear limitations. In addition to the aforementioned parameters, the dimensional changes by way of orthodontic or reconstructive or other methods that were considered when referring to the data are speculative only and were not explored and thus, the rigorous research is required to establish validity of the concept. The analyzed individual represents only a convenient sample, and the extrapolation of the results or to different TMD diagnostic groups, should be done with caution. However, the concept does follow basic physiologic principles and appears to be promising.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The dose of rabeprazole was then tapered to 20 mg qd aiming to stop completely before UGIE was performed to document the efficacy of treatment. However, the pain recurred badly after about a week. The patient requested us return to double-dose rabeprazole, which again relieved the pain.\n\n【8】The second UGIE performed when the patient was still on PPI showed that the lower esophageal ulcer had completely healed 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(c) and 1(d))</u>. There was a protrusion at the cardia, which was only identified when air was minimum insufflated, suspected of a submucosal lesion. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and CT scan were performed which surprisingly showed a giant submucosal tumor at the fourth layer of the lower esophagus and the cardia . EUS-FNA was performed, and the histological examination confirmed that this lesion was a leiomyoma .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Endoscopic ultrasound showed that the submucosal tumor arose from the fourth layer of the esophageal wall (a, b).

In addition, hiatal hernia was repaired with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication . As the tumor is too large, it was cut into pieces to facilitate its removal. The solid straightened tumor was approximately 8 cm × 3 cm in size . The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery.

The postoperation specimen is shown (f).</u>\n\n【13】Four months after her surgery, UGIE was performed again which showed good results of fundoplication surgery 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(e) and 1(f))</u>. The patient sometimes had epigastric pain which could be completely controlled with intermittent rabeprazole therapy at a standard dose.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】The clinical presentation of this patient would suggest dyspepsia be a differential diagnosis as postprandial pain is the predominant symptom. However, the first UGIE clearly showed an esophageal ulcer accompanying hiatal hernia. This suggested that the pain be an atypical symptom of GERD. According to the Asia-Pacific consensus, reflux symptoms which respond poorly to PPI at a standard dose in 8 weeks are considered as refractory GERD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This patient satisfied this definition, and she was managed as refractory GERD. The lower esophageal ulcer as a complication of GERD and the presence of hiatal hernia were the two factors suggesting that acid suppression not be enough in this patient.\n\n【16】The findings on EUS and CT scan and intraoperative observation all showed that the tumor did not penetrate the mucosal layer. The esophageal ulcer could be due to tumor compression, which caused anatomical changes weakening the antireflux barrier. That the giant tumor was missed during the first UGIE would be due to some reasons. First, this leiomyoma tumor did not protrude much into the esophageal lumen. Therefore, dysphagia was absent and its endoscopic detection required a high suspicion with minimum air insufflation. There have been some case reports showing that esophageal leiomyoma might even masquerade as achalasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Dysphagia was the predominant symptom in these patients, and UGIE revealed a dilated and tortuous esophagus with no clear findings suggesting of submucosal tumor. Second, the patient is a young female while leiomyoma has been generally reported in middle-aged, male patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. A few case reports in Asia previously described giant esophageal leiomyoma in young females, but the diagnosis of these cases were not challenging as dysphagia was a predominant symptom and the tumors were easily identified under endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. This is the first time that such a giant leiomyoma is reported in a young woman in Vietnam.\n\n【17】There were several options for the enucleation of such tumors, such as the thoracotomic, thoracoscopic, or laparoscopic approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. However, the laparoscopic transhiatal approach was chosen in order to avoid causing extensive defect in the esophageal wall, which might lead to impaired esophageal peristalsis and damage of the lower esophageal sphincter. Also, the hiatal hernia was finally repaired with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication after finishing the enucleation procedure. Recently, submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection has been introduced into the management of subepithelial lesions of the esophagus. Using meticulous dissection techniques, en bloc resection of giant esophageal leiomyoma could be performed safely and effectively in the hands of experts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】This case raises some interesting questions. First, whether the pain in this patient was due to tumor compression or cardia ulceration or it was actually an atypical reflux symptom. As the frequency and severity of the pain paralleled with the intensity of acid suppression therapy, acid reflux would be the major pathogenesis factor. But, that the pain was completely controlled with a neuromodulator add-on therapy suggested that tumor compression be a contributory factor. The weak point of this case was that there was no esophageal manometry and pH monitoring investigations to document the symptom index. However, that the pain significantly improved after tumor removal and hiatal hernia repair and only intermittent standard-dose PPI therapy was enough to control the patient’s symptoms supported this theory. Second, whether there was a direct association between the presence of leiomyoma and hiatal hernia or this coexistence was by chance in this patient. There have been several studies showing that the coexistence between hiatal hernia and lower esophageal submucosal tumor was very common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 12, 13\\]</u>. A case series on 66 patients who underwent surgery therapy for esophageal leiomyoma found that hiatal hernia presented in 15 (23%) patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The association may be incidental, but there is also suggestion that the tumor pulls the esophageal-gastric junction and causes hiatal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In Vietnam, the prevalence of hiatal hernia was only 2.3% among patients who presented with upper gastrointestinal symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Also, it was especially very uncommon in such a young female. Therefore, we believe that the hiatal hernia could be associated with the leiomyoma in this patient.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【20】We report a case of giant lower esophageal leiomyoma with concomitant hiatal hernia in a young female, who presented with refractory gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. The leiomyoma was missed during the first UGIE as the tumor grew outward. It is important to look carefully for submucosal tumor at the lower esophagus and cardia under endoscopy in patients with similar manifestations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

These locally advanced cancers often involve the celiac axis or the common hepatic artery and are therefore declared unresectable. The extended distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac artery may offer a chance of complete resection. We present the case of a 48-year-old female with pancreatic body cancer invading the celiac axis. The patient underwent laparoscopy to exclude hepatic and peritoneal metastasis. Subsequently, a selective embolization of the common hepatic artery was performed to enlarge arterial flow to the hepatobiliary system and the stomach via the pancreatoduodenal arcades from the superior mesenteric artery. Fifteen days after embolization, the extended distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and en bloc resection of the celiac axis was carried out. The postoperative course was uneventful, and complete tumor resection was achieved. This case report and a review of the literature show the feasibility and safety of the extended distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis. A preoperative embolization of the celiac axis may avoid ischemia-related complications of the stomach or the liver.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is still a tumor entity with a poor prognosis and an overall long-term survival of 1–5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. A major problem is its early detection since 80–90% of the pancreatic cancers are locally or systemically advanced at the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>. Despite recent advances in chemotherapy, complete resection remains the only chance for cure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>. Thus, five-year survival rates of about 25% are observed if patients underwent surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Especially cancers of the body and tail of the pancreas are discovered mostly at advanced stages due to a lack of early symptoms; for example, obstructive jaundice which is caused by cancers of the head of the pancreas. These locally advanced cancers of the body and tail often involve major vessels such as the celiac axis or the common hepatic artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Hence the tumors are declared unresectable in spite of the absence of distant metastasis.\n\n【4】The standard resection for tumors of the body and tail of the pancreas is a distal pancreatectomy with concomitant splenectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac artery has broadened the operative spectrum in pancreatic surgery. First reported by Appleby in 1953 to achieve complete nodal clearance around the celiac artery for advanced gastric cancer, Nimura adopted this approach, for advanced cancers of the pancreatic body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 8\\]</u>. Since then just a few of these procedures have been described and due to the small number of patients, the overall survival benefit is still unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. We present the case of a 48-year-old female with pancreatic body cancer invading the celiac axis treated by preoperative embolization and subsequent extended distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 48-year-old otherwise healthy woman had suffered epigastric and back pain for 4 weeks. At first, gastroscopy was performed showing no pathological findings. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography depicted a 3.3 cm lesion in the body of the pancreas with invasion of the celiac axis 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Therefore, the tumor was declared unresectable in an external hospital, and a palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and erlotinib was initiated. After 3 cycles of chemotherapy, she presented to our clinic to be reassessed. We carefully reviewed the findings and agreed a surgical approach with her. The patient underwent laparoscopy to exclude hepatic and peritoneal metastasis. Subsequently a selective embolization of the common hepatic was performed. First celiac and superior mesenteric artery angiograms were obtained to confirm the presence of the pancreatoduodenal arcade. Thereafter, a 6F sheath was placed in the common hepatic artery. After the identification of the origin of the gastroduodenal artery an 8 mm Amplatzer vascular plug 4 (AGA Medical Corp. Plymouth, MN USA) was placed in the common hepatic artery 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. Completion angiograms of the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery confirmed complete occlusion of the common hepatic artery and retrograde arterial perfusion of the liver and the stomach through the pancreatoduodenal arcade 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Preoperative arterial phase contrast-enhanced CT scan showing a 3.3 cm lesion in the body of the pancreas.

(b) The immediate angiographic control after embolization shows a collateral circulation from the superior mesenteric artery via the pancreatoduodenal arcades to the gastroduodenal artery. This ensures sufficient arterial flow to the right gastroepiploic artery (arrow) and the proper hepatic artery (arrowhead). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】Fifteen days after embolization of the celiac axis, the extended distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and en bloc resection of the celiac axis was carried out. We favour an upper abdominal transverse incision with extension to the xiphoid to ensure maximum visibility and access to the pancreas. After confirming the absence of hepatic and peritoneal metastasis, the superior mesenteric artery was exposed at its origin from the aorta to exclude tumor infiltration. The patient underwent a prophylactic cholecystectomy to avoid postoperative ischemic cholecystitis. The hepatoduodenal ligament was dissected, and the proper hepatic artery, the common hepatic artery, and the gastroduodenal artery were exposed. After the common hepatic artery was divided proximally to the origin of the gastroduodenal artery, an excellent pulsation of the left and right hepatic artery was still assessed. The pancreas was transected at the level of the portal vein. The dissection of the portal vein revealed a potential tumor infiltration at the splenic vein confluence; thus, a concomitant portal vein wedge resection was performed. Then the origin of the celiac artery was identified above the superior mesenteric artery, and the celiac artery and the left gastric artery were divided. The body and tail of the pancreas, the spleen, the celiac axis, and the surrounding lymph nodes and nerve plexus were removed en bloc . Finally, the pancreatic duct was ligated separately and the pancreatic head stump was oversewn with nonabsorbable suture material. The operation lasted 195 min, the intraoperative blood loss was 350 mL, and no red blood cell transfusions were required.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Operative photograph taken after the removal of the specimen. 1: head of the pancreas, 2: portal vein, 3: superior mesenteric vein, 4: gastroduodenal artery, and 5: celiac axis stump. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】The postoperative course went uneventful, and the patient was discharged after 20 days stay in the hospital. A postoperative CT scan revealed sufficient arterial flow of the hepatic arteries via the pancreatoduodenal arcades . A moderate increase of the serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase returned to normal ranges within the hospital stay. A postoperative diarrhoea or ischemic gastropathy did not occur. Additionally, the patient did not develop a pancreoprivic diabetes mellitus. The postsplenectomy vaccine prophylaxis against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and Neisseria meningitidis was administered during, the hospital stay.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | The postoperative arterial contrast-enhanced CT scan shows an excellent arterial flow to the hepatobiliary system via gastroduodenal artery and pancreatoduodenal arcades from the superior mesenteric artery. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【13】The histopathologic findings showed an invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (pT3) with a size of 6 cm and clear histologically surgical margins (R0). The histopathologic grading was G2 (moderately differentiated), and two regional lymph node metastases were detected (2/17). A notable perineural infiltration extending to the celiac plexus was present. On the recommendation of the interdisciplinary gastrointestinal tumor board, a postoperative chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle for 6 months) was carried out. After treatment completion no local recurrence and distant metastasis occurred as evaluated by CT scan.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Due to late presentation of symptoms, more than 75% of carcinomas of the body and tail of the pancreas are considered unresectable at the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. The most common reasons are the presence of hepatic metastases, peritoneal dissemination of tumor, or the direct invasion of major vascular structures, respectively. Venous resections including the portal and superior mesenteric vein are well-accepted procedures, while tumor invasion of the superior mesenteric artery or the celiac axis is regarded as a contraindication for a surgical approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. This rejection is due to previously reported high mortality and poor prognosis after resection of arterial vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 15\\]</u>. Should a tumor invasion of the common hepatic artery or the celiac axis be indeed a general contraindication to resection? Consequentially, these patients, as seen in our case report, would receive chemotherapy in a palliative intention with an approximately median survival of only 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Since Nimura implemented the distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis in 1976, a few authors have performed this procedure successfully 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. Due to the small number of patients, the overall survival benefit remains unclear. Hirano et al. report an estimated overall 1- and 5-year survival rate of 71% and 42%, respectively, and the median survival was 21.0 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Mayumi et al. compared the outcome of 47 patients with carcinoma of the pancreatic body or tail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Six cases underwent an extended distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis, 19 cases received a standard distal pancreatectomy, and a third group consisted of 22 patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The cumulative 1- and 3-year accumulated survival rates for the extended, standard, and unresectable groups were 40.0, 33.3, and 5.4, and 20.0, 16.6, and 0%, respectively. Wu et al. compared 31 patients with invasion of the common hepatic artery or celiac axis: 11 patients, who received a distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis, to 20 patients, who did not undergo surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The first group had a significantly prolonged median survival time compared with the second group (14 versus 5 months, ). However, estimated 5-year survival rates of 42% as reported by Hirano et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> must be read with caution due to the small number of patients. But a median survival time of 21.0 months is excellent in cases that have previously been considered unresectable. The distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis can achieve a R0 resectability rate of 91% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. It is well known that a complete tumor resection with negative surgical margins is an important independent prognostic factor for survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and the only chance for cure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>. Hence, a surgical approach is justified in selected cases with advanced pancreatic cancers.\n\n【17】Additionally, this operation not only increases the resectability but also improves quality of life due to long-lasting pain relief 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 17\\]</u>. Advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma frequently involves nervous tissue and spreads along nerve fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>. The cancer involvement of the celiac plexus and celiac ganglions results in intractable pain, and medical treatment is often unsuccessful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Thus new techniques including celiac plexus block 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 20, 21\\]</u>, intrathecal morphine administration via a subcutaneous pump 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>, or thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> have been developed. However complete pain relief is difficult to achieve. Hirano et al. report a complete pain relief in all 10 patients with preoperative intractable pain after distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Because radical distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis includes complete removal of the celiac plexus and celiac ganglions, it is understandable that the operative procedure results in excellent pain control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 17, 24\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Despite these advantages the high morbidity rate of the distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis must be considered. Hirano et al. report a morbidity rate of 48% in a series with 23 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The main postoperative complications were pancreatic fistula and ischemic gastropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 25, 26\\]</u>. An arterial reconstruction is mostly dispensable because collateral pathways via the superior mesenteric artery, pancreatoduodenal arcades, and gastroduodenal artery maintain the arterial blood supply for the hepatobiliary system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The entire stomach can be preserved because collateral pathways ensure arterial flow also to the right gastroepiploic artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A preoperative embolization of the celiac axis may prevent ischemia-related complications of the stomach or the liver by enlarging these collateral pathways from the superior mesenteric artery. Hirano et al. noticed a remarkable decrease of ischemic gastropathy to an incidence of 13% after the introduction of the preoperative coil embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Therefore, we also performed an embolization of the celiac axis 15 days prior to the operation. Previously published case series report a waiting period between embolization and surgery of 1–29 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 27, 28\\]</u>. Although there is no reliable evidence base available regarding length of waiting period after embolization, we have some knowledge from studies concerning preoperative gastric conditioning prior to esophagectomy. Bludau et al. found that gastric mucosal oxygen saturation, which drops significantly with devascularization of the stomach, nearly returns to baseline levels by 4-5 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. A study by Veeramootoo et al. on gastric conduit reported that ischemic preconditioning 2 weeks before surgery was associated with less ischemia-related gastric failure compared to 5 days prior to surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. However, the ideal timing needs to be further ascertained.\n\n【19】During surgery the key vessel of the distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis is the inferior pancreatoduodenal artery from the superior mesenteric artery, and surgeons should identify this artery to avoid an accidental injury. If an arterial reconstruction is needed, a middle colic artery-gastroepiploic artery bypass can be used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The splenic artery, which can be taken from the resected specimen, is another suitable option for reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. We performed a staging laparoscopy before coil embolization of the celiac axis to confirm absence of metastatic disease. Approximately 40–50% of the patients have distant metastases at the time presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 31, 32\\]</u>. Despite advances of imaging technology, noninvasive staging modalities are still inaccurate in identifying small volume metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. A staging laparoscopy may reveal these unsuspected metastases and prevent unnecessary coil embolization and laparotomy.\n\n【20】This case report and the cited studies display the feasibility and safety of the operation. The encouraging results of Hirano et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, who reported a median survival time of 21 months, cannot hide the fact that distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis on its own cannot achieve a favorable long-term survival. Despite the excellent local control achieved through this procedure, early hepatic recurrence still persists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The adjuvant treatment as a postoperative chemotherapy seems to be a key factor to further improve patient survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】The extended distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the celiac axis following a preoperative embolization provides a high resectability rate and a long-lasting pain relief. These results justify further evaluation of the long-term survival benefits. However, this procedure should always be considered in patients with locally advanced cancer of the pancreatic body or tail involving the celiac axis or the common hepatic artery. The presentation of these patients to a high volume center of pancreatic surgery may avoid premature palliative chemotherapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Most commonly, an attentive patient observes such changes early in the course; when missed by the patient, such changes are usually noted by an observant clinician. Clinical diagnosis can be challenging if the patient is on multiple medications because other causes must be excluded. This condition occurs via multiple mechanisms. Frequently, the pigmentary change is reversible with discontinuation of the drug. Causative medications include nonsteroidal; anti-inflammatory agents, antimalarials, antibiotics, psychotropics, amiodarone, and chemotherapeutic agents. The; antimicrobials responsible for hyperpigmentation are antimalarials, tetracyclines, tigecycline, dapsone, rifampicin, and antiretrovirals such as zidovudine. Sunlight exposure can worsen the pigmentation seen with some of the above antimicrobials (e.g. dapsone). Here, we describe an older adult white woman presenting with acute cutaneous; hyperpigmentation of the bilateral lower extremities while on levofloxacin therapy. Hyperpigmentation resolved after cessation of the agent. Our case highlights this unique acute presentation after only a few days of oral levofloxacin.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Fluoroquinolones are a class of antibiotics that belong to the quinolone family of antimicrobial agents. Fluoroquinolones have good oral bioavailability, excellent tolerability, and a broad spectrum of activity. Some fluoroquinolones are not in current clinical use due to their uncommon toxicities. The ones commonly used in clinical practice are ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. They stop bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis via the inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are indicated in the treatment of urinary tract infections. Accordingly, they constitute some of the more commonly prescribed oral antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common adverse effects are reported in the gastrointestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), nervous system (headache, insomnia, mood alterations, hallucinations, and delirium), and connective tissue (tendinitis, retinal detachment, and aortic dissection). Although uncommon, skin reactions typically include rashes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Upon review of the medical literature in PubMed, only four cases of levofloxacin-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>. In most of these cases, the duration of levofloxacin was more than one week, and typically on the order of months. We report a case of bilateral lower extremity hyperpigmentation that occurred in an older white woman with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) after she completed a five-day course of oral levofloxacin for cystitis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 58-year-old white woman presented to the clinic with a hyperpigmented bluish-grey rash over the bilateral lower extremities persistent for two days . Past medical history was significant for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with Stage 5 CKD and hypertension. She was not on any anticoagulation. A few days before this clinic visit, she was treated with oral levofloxacin 750 mg daily for five days (total of 3750 mg) for a urinary tract infection. She denied any recent sick contacts or fever. On further questioning, she admitted to noticing this rash on day three of treatment. She denied any significant sun exposure to her lower extremities. Physical examination revealed a nonblanching bluish-grey rash located on the bilateral lower extremities, especially over the anterolateral aspect involving bilateral feet. Distal pulses were regular. No other significant clinical findings were observed on examination. Her blood work revealed a healthy complete blood cell count with differential. The basic metabolic panel revealed a stable baseline creatinine. She was referred to the dermatology clinic where she underwent skin biopsy of the lesions on her lower extremities. Skin biopsy revealed scattered deposits of brown-black pigment in dermal spindle cells and minimal inflammation, indicating pigmentary rash . High-power magnification displayed coarse brown pigmented cytoplasmic granules within the dermal macrophages . The patients’ medication history revealed no new medication other than the levofloxacin over the last four weeks. The patient had completed antibiotic therapy when she presented to the clinic with hyperpigmentation changes. On follow-up at the clinic three weeks later, the rash seen earlier over the bilateral lower extremities had entirely resolved with no residual changes.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bilateral legs with pigmentary changes.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Low-power magnification shows widely dispersed dermal pigmentation and an epidermis with no significant pathologic changes (20x; hematoxylin and eosin staining).</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Intermediate magnification shows coarse cytoplasmic granular brown pigmentation within aggregates of macrophages surrounding eccrine structures in the dermis (100x; hematoxylin and eosin staining).</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Intermediate magnification shows coarse cytoplasmic granular brown pigmentation within aggregates of macrophages surrounding eccrine structures in the dermis (200x; hematoxylin and eosin staining).</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 High-power magnification displays coarse brown pigmented cytoplasmic granules within the dermal macrophages (400x; hematoxylin and eosin staining).</u>\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Levofloxacin is a well-tolerated medication with good oral bioavailability, making it an optimal choice as an oral antibiotic. Levofloxacin is associated with dermatologic adverse effects in less than 3% of instances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common presentation is an unspecified rash. With a treatment duration of five days or fewer, such a rash is infrequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Uncommonly, it can cause a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, phototoxicity, Stevens—Johnson syndrome, fixed drug eruption, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It can cause hyperpigmentation, albeit rarely. A small but significant fraction (10% to 20%) of acquired pigmentation cases are drug-induced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Minocycline is the most common antibiotic responsible for drug-induced hyperpigmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. In a few isolated cases, polymyxin and tigecycline have caused this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Among the quinolones, few cases have been reported, and all were due to pefloxacin and levofloxacin. The levofloxacin tablet coating contains small quantities of iron oxide and hydroxide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The mechanisms responsible for this hyperpigmentation include drug metabolite deposits, precipitation of intracellular iron chelate complexes within macrophages, and increased intracellular melanin production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6, 8\\]</u>. A review of the medical literature via PubMed revealed only four reported cases of levofloxacin-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation—all confirmed by biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>. On review of these cases, three patients were on oral levofloxacin therapy for more than four weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 5\\]</u>. One case report mentioned the use of levofloxacin for only eleven days. This patient had significant exposure to sunlight with phototoxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. None of the four case reports mentioned any significant CKD. In our patient, the pigmentary changes on the lower extremities were seen on the third day of the five day therapeutic regimen. She received a higher dose of levofloxacin (a total of 3750 mg) based on her renal function. Levofloxacin and its metabolites are renally excreted. A higher dose in a patient with unhealthy renal function results in the accumulation of the drug and its metabolites. Her prior Stage 5 CKD predisposed her to a higher risk of developing adverse effects. The standard levofloxacin dose in Stage 5 CKD is a 500 mg bolus dose followed by 250 mg every 48 hours over five days (for a total of 1000 mg). Based on the renal calculation of the dose, our patient received a total of 31 days’ worth of levofloxacin over five days. Thus, our Stage 5 CKD patient received a significantly higher dose of levofloxacin (3750 mg instead of 1000 mg for five days), resulting in the accumulation of the drug and its metabolites. The rash resolved completely in three weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Discontinuation of the offending medication is currently the only therapeutic modality for levofloxacin-induced hyperpigmentation. Pigmentary changes in all the case reports resolved following the discontinuation of levofloxacin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>.\n\n【13】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【14】We report an unusual adverse effect of levofloxacin in a CKD patient. This case report stresses the importance of dose adjustments of renally excreted medications in the CKD population. Also, CKD patients may present with pigmentary changes earlier than a typical patient due to supratherapeutic drug levels. While such changes are reversible by discontinuation of the drug, in such instances, a new regimen based on the antibiogram must then be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

They are related to mutations in the CNTNAP1 (contactin associated protein 1) gene, playing an important role in myelination. Recent studies have shown that both diseases could present with a wide phenotypic spectrum, with promising survival up to early childhood. We report on a 7-year-old boy from a nonconsanguineous Lebanese family presenting with neonatal hypotonia, respiratory distress, and arthrogryposis. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of a pathogenic variant in the CNTNAP1 gene leading to a premature stop codon: NM\\003632.2:c.3361C>T p.(Arg1121). A review of the literature is discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Mutations the CNTNAP1 gene (contactin associated protein 1) (OMIM 602346) have been associated with two rare autosomal recessive congenital diseases, lethal congenital contracture syndrome type 7 (LCCS7) (OMIM 616286), and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy type 3 (CHN3) (OMIM 618186). CNTNAP1 is located on chromosome 17q21 and encodes a contactin-associated transmembrane receptor (CASPR), highly essential in the formation of paranodal axoglial junctions in myelinated axons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】CNTNAP1 is also involved in regulating neural progenitor cells and the development of cerebral cortex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It was first implicated in human disease in 2014, leading to disorders characterized by polyhydramnios, severe neonatal hypotonia, arthrogryposis, facial diplegia, and severe motor paralysis, leading to death in early infancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. These mutations have been reported in 31 patients, with a wide phenotypic spectrum and promising survival up to early childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here, we report on a new case presenting with LCCS7 with a novel identified CNTNAP1 variant, with survival beyond early infancy.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【7】This study is conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n【8】##### 2.1. Clinical Presentation\n\n【9】The patient is a 7-year-old boy, born to Lebanese unrelated healthy parents. He is the second of three children, his siblings being both healthy.\n\n【10】##### 2.2. Whole Exome Sequencing\n\n【11】After informed consent was obtained by the parents in compliance with national ethics regulation, genomic DNA extraction was performed from peripheral blood using standard techniques.\n\n【12】Approximately 60 Mb of the consensus coding sequences (>99%) were enriched from fragmented genomic DNA using the SureSelect Human All Exon V6 kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the generated library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with an average coverage depth of 100x. An end-to-end bioinformatics pipelines including base calling, primary filtering of low quality reads and probable artefacts, and annotation of variants was applied.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【14】##### 3.1. Clinical Report\n\n【15】Pregnancy was complicated with placental abruption and unexplained polyhydramnios. The patient was born after an emergent C-section at 35 weeks of gestational age, with generalized hypotonia and a severe respiratory distress. His weight was 2340 g (25<sup>th</sup> percentile), his length was 47 cm (50<sup>th</sup> percentile), and his head circumference was 36 cm (>97<sup>th</sup> percentile). On initial examination, he was comatose, hypotonic, with absence of spontaneous motility, and intermittent trepidation of lower limbs. He was intubated and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Upon admission, initial metabolic and infectious workups were within normal ranges. Cardiac evaluation was normal. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a slowing of flow in some superficial cortical veins with asymmetric flow in both transverse sinuses with no visible thrombophlebitis. An electroencephalogram monitoring revealed a slowed cerebral activity with intermittent burst suppressions. Neurological workout included the dosage of neurotransmitters in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that identified a dosage of L-dopa at 31 nmol/L (reference range lower than 30 nmol/L), a low dosage of homovanillic acid (HVA) (<543 nmol/L; reference range between 601 and 1397 nmol/L), and a low dosage of 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) (<383 nmol/L; reference range between 382 and 949 nmol/L).\n\n【16】On clinical examination at one month of age, the patient remained hypotonic, areflexic, with no visual tracking nor blinking, and an absence of muscular movements of the intercostal muscles. He also presented a major plagiocephaly and a persistent upper limbs contraction. He was noted to have epicanthal folds, thickened nares, and thickened lips. He received valproic acid for recurrent generalized clonic movements. Dilated fundus examination revealed an anterior subcapsular cataract in the right eye. The patient underwent tracheotomy and gastrostomy. Complementary metabolic workout was within normal ranges, including amino acid and organic acid chromatography. Muscle biopsy revealed muscular hypertrophy with mitochrondrial and neurogenic dysfunction. Congenital disorders of glycosylation were ruled out, as well as Prader-Willi syndrome, by genetic studies. Finally, a tracheotomy was undergone because of the impossibility of ventilation weaning, and the patient was fed by gastrostomy, due to the absence of swallowing.\n\n【17】Afterwards, no changes occurred in his clinical status. At seven years, generalized hypotonia remained prominent, and the patient showed a failure to thrive, with a weight of 16 kg (<1<sup>st</sup> percentile), a length of 102 cm (<1<sup>st</sup> percentile), and a head circumference of 56 cm (>97<sup>th</sup> percentile). Tracheotomy weaning turned out to be impossible and nutrition was provided exclusively by gastrostomy. No infections were detected and the patient received all his immunizations.\n\n【18】##### 3.2. Molecular Analysis\n\n【19】By whole-exome sequencing (WES), we detected a homozygous variant in the CNTNAP1 gene NM\\003632.2:c.3361C>T p.(Arg1121) that creates a premature stop codon. This variant has been confirmed by Sanger sequencing and found at the heterozygous state in both parents. It was classified as likely pathogenic (class 2) according to the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【21】CNTNAP1 involvement in human diseases was first described by Laquérriere in 2014 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. To this day, most of the 31 identified patients (11 LCCS7 and 20 CHN3), issued from 20 families, were males and answered to diverse ethnicities (Palestinian, Irish, English, American, Qatari, Lebanese, and French), which brings the number of affected families to twenty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 6–11\\]</u>. Only seven girls were reported to be affected, three of which were diagnosed with LCCS7 and four with CHN3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. First degree consanguinity was noted in most families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【22】##### 4.1. Clinical Features\n\n【23】All affected patients presented with respiratory distress at birth, secondary to motor nerve paralysis. Most of them were born preterm (58%) and had marked fetal akinesia (42%) with polyhydramnios (97%). Another classical finding was the absence of swallowing (58%). However, arthrogryposis multiplex congenital was present in 42%, with a nonspecific joint involvement. Hypotonia (87%) remains frequent in this population. Other findings remain rare and nonpathognomonic .\n\n【24】Table 1 Review of clinical features associated with LCCS7 and CHN3.\n\n【25】The above described patient answers to most of the clinical features reported previously. He also presented some of the rare features cited in the literature, such as seizures and epicanthus. To this date, this is the only surviving patient showing evidence of an isolated unilateral anterior subcapsular cataract in association with LCCS7. No known cause of juvenile nor congenital cataract was identified. The ophthalmological examination was otherwise within normal ranges, and the seizures were well controlled under treatment. Moreover, no other reported case underwent a dosage of CSF neurotransmitters, which could be a track to follow for further studies of management.\n\n【26】##### 4.2. Histopathology\n\n【27】Nerve biopsy is now less often performed, as genetic testing in patients with hereditary neuropathies is becoming increasingly used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 12\\]</u>. However, sural nerve biopsy is nonspecific and consists mainly of paranodal abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9\\]</u>, along with significant homogeneous axonal loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6, 9, 11\\]</u>, significant decrease of large myelinated fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10, 11\\]</u> and thin myelin sheaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6, 9–11\\]</u>, all consistent with hypomyelinating neuropathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 10\\]</u>. Muscle biopsy can reveal early muscle innervation disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> with generalized small muscle fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u> and neurogenic muscular atrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. On electron microscopic examination, a marked widening of the nodes of Ranvier is often noticed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 6, 11\\]</u>, leading to a loss of attachment sites of the myelin loops in the paranodal regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 11\\]</u> and an absence of the typical transverse bands that cross the paranodal junctional gap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【28】##### 4.3. Imaging\n\n【29】Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is also nonspecific and could reveal signs of hypomyelination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7–10\\]</u> and cerebral atrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8–10\\]</u>. Cases have been reported with normal brain MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 8, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【30】##### 4.4. Functional Explorations\n\n【31】Electroencephalography (EEG) might show a discontinuous immature pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, while electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies converge to a neurogenic rather than a myopathic pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9\\]</u>. Auditory and visual evoked potentials could be nonspecifically altered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【32】##### 4.5. Antenatal Diagnosis\n\n【33】Fetal sonography can detect prenatal manifestations for LCCS7, such as fetal hypokinesia, abnormal positioning of the limbs, and polyhydramnios that require therapeutic amniotic fluid reductions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. No interference with fetal growth velocity has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Detection can go as far as 27 weeks of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. No patient has been recorded to be born before 30 weeks of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【34】##### 4.6. Genetic Counseling\n\n【35】The present case identifies a new pathogenic variant in the CNTNAP1 gene, leading to a premature codon stop. The list of reported variants is presented in Table 2. While CHN3 can be caused by either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the CNTNAP1 gene, LCCS7 is only caused by a homozygous mutation.\n\n【36】Table 2 Variants in CNTNAP1 gene.\n\n【37】##### 4.7. Management\n\n【38】Although there is no evidence of a milder phenotype, extensive medical care might explain the survival of twelve cases to this day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Of the latter, four underwent gastrostomy and twelve tracheostomy at the neonatal intensive care unit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8–10\\]</u>. Supportive treatment must be provided accordingly.\n\n【39】##### 4.8. Prognosis\n\n【40】Life expectancy in patients with LCCS7 is usually limited to death in the neonatal period, varying from a few hours of life to three months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11\\]</u>. However, patients with CHN3 are reaching early teenager years, with the oldest reported patient at 15 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. To this day, ten patients with CHN3 are reported to be alive, and only one girl with LCCS7 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>; we report on the second LCCS7 patient to remain alive, leading to a total of twelve cases. Respiratory distress was the main cause of death.\n\n【41】##### 4.9. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【42】CHN were first described by Dejerine and Sottas in the late 1800s, and they consisted essentially of progressive muscle wasting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Later on, a larger spectrum has been identified and new classifications emerged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 14, 15\\]</u>. CHN present with hypotonia, areflexia, and distal muscle weakness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15–19\\]</u>. CHN1 (OMIM 605253) has commonly been linked to mutations in EGR2 gene, while CHN2 (OMIM 618184) is associated with mutations in MPZ gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Interestingly, no intellectual disability was reported in these two types, in opposition to CHN3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 11\\]</u>. Nerve histology remains nonspecific in CHN with severe hypomyelination, whereas other hypomyelinating diseases, such as Dejerine-Sottas Syndrome or Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1, a redundant “onion bulb” formation is found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 20, 21\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) has been linked to fetal hypokinesia and underlying neurologic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. It can result from an impairment of skeletal muscles, or the neuromuscular junction or axoglial development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 22\\]</u>. However, it can also be caused by nongenetic factors, namely maternal autoimmune myasthenia or mechanical limitations of fetal movements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. As recorded by Hengel et al. in 2017, AMC is no longer an obligate feature of hypomyelinating neuropathies and could either be the primary manifestation of a musculoskeletal disease or the secondary manifestation of a neurologic process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Consequently, in opposition to LCCS7, CHN3 is not associated with AMC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Moreover, LCCS form a heterogeneous family of 11 types that were all initially characterized by hypokinesia, AMC, and early neonatal death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. All types have been linked to non-overlapping genetic mutations: LCCS1 (OMIM 253310) caused by mutation in the GLE1 gene, LCCS2 (OMIM 607598) caused by mutation in the ERBB3 gene, LCCS3 (OMIM 611369) caused by mutation in the PIP5K1C gene, LCCS4 (OMIM 614915) caused by mutation in the MYBPC1 gene, LCCS5 (OMIM 615368) caused by mutation in the DNM2 gene, LCCS6 (OMIM 616248) caused by mutation in the ZBTB42 gene, LCCS8 (OMIM 616287) caused by mutation in the ADCY6 gene, LCCS9 (OMIM 616503) caused by mutation in the ADGRG6 gene, LCCS10 (OMIM 617022) caused by mutation in the NEK9 gene, and LCCS11 (OMIM 617194) caused by mutation in the GLDN gene.\n\n【45】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【46】In conclusion, LCCS7 and CHN3 are rare disorders, associated to a CNTNAP1 mutation. It combines severe neonatal hypotonia, to polyhydramnios and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy, along with severe respiratory insufficiency often requiring tracheostomy, and developmental delay. Survival beyond early infancy is almost uncommon. However, early extensive medical care has recently proven to elongate life expectancy, up to late childhood.

The syndrome is characterized by cognitive impairment, encephalopathy, psychiatric symptoms, and seizures associated with increased level of anti-thyroid antibodies. The exact pathophysiology underlying cerebral involvement is still lesser known. Although symptoms suggest a nonlesional encephalopathy in most of the cases, sometimes the clinical appearance can be subtle and may not respond to immunosuppressants or immunomodulatory agents. Here we report a case who presented with drowsiness and amnestic complaints associated with paroxysmal electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities which could be treated only with an antiepileptic drug.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hashimoto’s encephalopathy (HE) has been acknowledged as a syndrome of altered mental status varying between delusional thinking, confusion, and hallucinations with the presence of increased serum levels of anti-thyroid antibodies. Epileptic seizures may accompany these symptoms. The syndrome was first described by Brain and colleagues as a case report in 1966 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. HE syndrome can be acute and fulminant or chronic as in dementia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Ataxia, tremor, myoclonus, focal neurologic deficit, and some psychiatric symptoms including depression, manic state, and psychosis in severe forms can be observed in this syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. HE is relatively rare and still lesser known. Here we present a patient with paroxysmal memory impairment attacks and loss of attention. Here we report and discuss clinical, electroencephalographic (EEG), and neuroimaging findings of a HE syndrome by highlighting diagnostic and treatment features.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 52-year-old woman suffering with drowsiness and memory problems was admitted to our hospital’s neurology department. She complained about disremembering some parts of a day and what she had done. These attacks were lasting for a few minutes to one hour sometimes and repeating every day in last three months. She had no history of psychiatric disease, epilepsy, or other mental problems including dementia. Neurologic examination did not reveal any focal abnormalities. Extended laboratory findings including CBC, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, vitamin B12, folate, electrolytes, blood ammonia, and glucose levels were normal. Thyroid function tests including free T3, free T4, and TSH were normal. Her mini mental state examination test score was within the normal range for her age and education level (29/30). Neither a noncontrast cranial computerized tomography 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u> nor the T1-weighted images of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormalities like calcification. T1-weighted images after intravenous gadolinium administration were unremarkable. No evidence of cytotoxic edema was present on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2 weighted images demonstrated bilaterally symmetric basal ganglia hyperintensity 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(b) and 1(c))</u>. On EEG, the background activity was mildly slow and irregular 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. An interictal EEG recording showed bilateral paroxysms of rudimentary spike and sharp wave discharges 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Mini mental state examination test score was 27. To explain the etiology of subacute encephalopathy we examined her autoimmune markers. Serum anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and ENA panel tests were negative. Anti-thyroid antibodies were elevated. Anti-TPO was 1258 U/mL and the anti-TG antibody was 154. In the light of clinic and laboratory findings she was diagnosed as HE. Intravenous methylprednisolone treatment with a dose of 1000 mg per day was initiated and maintained orally 60 mg per day. Control EEG on the 14th day of the treatment showed a normal background activity. Her attention and drowsiness were also improved. However the paroxysms of sharp waves on EEG persisted and she was still complaining about amnesia attacks. The patient was given orally levetiracetam with a dose of 1000 mg per day. On follow-up she was symptom free and her control EEG recording was normal.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Noncontrast CT scan is normal (a) and FLAIR 通用删除1(英):<u>(fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)</u> images demonstrate increased T2 signal activity at bilateral lentiform and caudate nucleus (b-c).</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 EEG showing the presence of slow and irregular background (a) and bilateral sharp wave paroxysms (b).</u>\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can cause an autoimmune encephalopathy with an unknown pathophysiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The clinic presentation of this rarely seen syndrome is variable including psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairments, seizures, and hemispheric neurologic deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Patients with HE can be euthyroid as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. An extended diagnostic procedure for vascular, toxic, metabolic, and infectious diseases should be performed carefully to avoid other etiologies which are not caused by thyroid dysfunctions such as autoimmune encephalopathy, infections of central nervous system, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, and CNS angiitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【10】The most common cranial MRI changes in this syndrome include bilateral subcortical high signal lesions and bilateral hippocampus or thalamic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, as in a recently reported case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> our patients MRI showed bilaterally, symmetrical basal ganglia hyperintensity without any mass effect, cytotoxic edema, and calcification.\n\n【11】Our case is a patient who presented with drowsiness, loss of attention, and paroxysmal memory impairment attacks associated with symmetric slowing background activity and bilateral paroxysms of sharp wave discharges on EEG. It is well known that HE may be associated with mental and cognitive dysfunctions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In a recent study, Wang et al. showed that the impairments in cognitive functions for patients with HE are similar to those with Alzheimer’s disease patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Epileptic seizures can also be seen in HE. The most frequent seizure types contain generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and complex partial seizures often associated with an EEG showing diffuse slowing background activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The syndrome can cause status epilepticus rarely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. In HE, steroid therapy has shown to be associated with improvement or resolution of EEG findings. However, in our patient even though the slow background activity on EEG was improved after steroid therapy, the paroxysmal slow-wave discharges persisted until levetiracetam was initiated as an antiepileptic drug. Similar to our case, in two cases recently reported by Wang et al, levetiracetam was found to be effective in treatment of HE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【12】It is important to recognize this syndrome which is usually treatable successfully with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents such as IVIG, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and azathioprine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Nevertheless, as in our case steroid therapy may not always be able to treat both clinic and electrophysiologic symptoms. Therefore appropriate antiepileptic medication should be administered.\n\n【13】HE should be considered especially in patients with encephalopathy with an unexplained etiology. But our case demonstrated that HE symptoms can be subtle. On such an occasion, the clinicians should suspect the presence of HE and evaluate anti-thyroid antibodies. But we thought that emphasis must be given to EEG which is valuable in evaluation of neurological conditions either associated with or apart from epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. As in our case, in patients with impaired consciousness or altered mental state EEG is important in diagnosing and monitoring the whole treatment process.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The most frequently involved vessel is the aorta as well as femoral and cerebral arteries. A vascular-colonic fistula from infected aneurysms is even rarer, which remains a challenge for diagnosis and treatment. In this case report, we aimed to illustrate an 89-year-old man presenting initially with an aneurysm of the right common iliac artery. Forty days later, this lesion was infected and produced fresh blood in the rectum and sigmoid colon observed by colonoscopy. The final diagnosis of this case was a right common iliac artery aneurysm-colonic fistula due to infection. The patient was successfully diagnosed and treated with surgery at our hospital.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】A mycotic aneurysm is an uncommon disease caused by infection of the artery wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is difficult to diagnose early due to its silent manifestation; therefore, an infected aneurysm is often treated when complications arise, such as rupture or fistula. For unruptured mycotic aneurysms, the mortality rate is 15%–50%, whereas the mortality rate for ruptured aneurysms is as high as 90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Concerning a vascular-colonic fistula secondary to an infected aneurysm, its unusual complication with gastrointestinal bleeding is a decisive sign of this condition. If mycotic aneurysms rupture into the bowel, patients are likely to suffer a massive hemorrhage, fulminant sepsis, or even a fatality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. With a leaking aneurysm, the clinical onset may be gastrointestinal hemorrhage lasting from several days to months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Imaging features play an important role in the detection of infected aneurysms in suspected cases and, in confirmed cases, imaging modalities also help clinicians assess complications and vascular mapping before treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Several imaging modalities are used in the diagnosis of mycotic aneurysms, such as Doppler ultrasonography, multidetector computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and conventional angiography; however, CT angiography remains the first choice. Furthermore, blood culture and biomarkers for fungal antigens such as cryptococcus antigen, galactomannan, or 1,3-beta-D-glucan are quite crucial for the determination of etiology. In terms of management, antibiotic therapy, intervention, and surgery are most often used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. In this article, we intended to depict a rare case of a mycotic aneurysm with a right common iliac artery-colonic fistula.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】An 89-year-old man presented to the emergency department with hematochezia for 7 days. His medical history was unremarkable. Forty days before admission, he had pain in his lower abdomen and hematuria. An abdominal CT scan showed a saccular aneurysm of the right common iliac artery (17 × 18 mm in size) with fat stranding, edema, gas, and prominent inflammatory soft tissue around the aneurysm  and a bladder tumor. He was treated with a complete resectioning of the bladder tumor, and the histopathology result demonstrated transitional cell carcinoma. However, the aneurysm was treated with conservative management.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT scanner forty days prior to admission. (a) Enhanced axial CT shows a bladder tumor (arrow). (b, c) Enhanced coronal and axial CT shows a 17 × 18 mm saccular aneurysm arising from the right common iliac artery  surrounded by fat stranding. (d) Enhanced axial CT shows small foci of gas (arrow).</u>\n\n【8】A physical examination showed the patient was conscious with a temperature of 37.2°C, he had tachycardia with a pulse of 107 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 98/60 mmHg, his respiration was 16 beats per minute, and he had pale skin. An abdominal examination indicated his abdomen was soft without a palpable mass, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly. A rectal examination showed hematochezia, but no other anomalies were detected. The laboratory test results were the following: hemoglobin 75 g/L, hematocrit 0.24 L/L, white blood cell 5.91 g/L, platelet 189 g/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 2.29 mg/dL.\n\n【9】An abdominal CT scan at the time of admission showed a significant increase in the size of the aneurysm (31 × 36 × 40 mm), with a neck of 7 mm and irregular wall thickening with 15 mm of mural thrombus . The fat stranding, edema, gas, and inflammatory soft tissue surrounding the aneurysm were also increased compared to 40 days before, indicating that infectious process of aneurysm was increased. The anterior wall of the aneurysm had adhered to the posterior wall of the sigmoid colon, and a colonoscopy revealed fresh blood in the rectum and sigmoid colon and hematic infiltration of the sigmoid wall . The patient was diagnosed with a fistula between the mycotic right common iliac artery aneurysm and the sigmoid colon and underwent an emergency laparotomy.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CT scanner at the time of admission.

The aneurysm had signs of inflammation: edema and adhesion on the surrounding tissue. A fistula between the sigmoid colon and aneurysm was determined on the anterior wall of the aneurysm with a diameter of about 30 mm . To diminish the risk of graft infection, the vascular surgeon decided to create a femoral-femoral bypass graft and then remove the aneurysm. A resectioning of the affected colon segment and end-colostomy (Hartmann’s procedure) was performed. After surgery, the patient was given sulperazone and metronidazole. Two days later, he had a temperature of 39 °C. Subsequently, blood cultures were drawn, which grew Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Imipenem, amikacin, and tigecycline were added to the antibiotic therapy. Fourteen days later, the patient’s fever was resolved and his leukocyte count and CRP concentration were within normal ranges. He was discharged five days later.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Intraoperative results (a, b); arrow in (b): injured sigmoid colon.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Illustration of the anatomic relations found at operation showing the right common iliac artery aneurysm, sigmoid colon, and the fistula between them.</u>\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Mycotic aneurysms are saccular vascular dilatations caused by the destruction of the vessel wall by invasive organisms. It may result from hematogenous spread, lymphatic spread, or direct extension from an adjacent infected organ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Mycotic aneurysms can involve any artery, but the aorta is the most frequently affected section 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The femoral artery is the most frequently involved peripheral artery due to intravenous drug abusers or interventional procedures, with mycotic iliac aneurysms presenting in about 2% of these cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【17】A vascular-enteric fistula is a form of pathological communication between the vascular system and the gastrointestinal tract and may be the result of a myotic aneurysm. Aortoenteric fistulas can be classified as primary or secondary and most often involve the duodenum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Fistulization of an iliac aneurysm into the sigmoid colon is rare and results in lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The clinical presentations are variable with acute or chronic, massive or slight gastrointestinal hemorrhage, such as hematochezia, hemorrhagic shock, or syncope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. These patients also suffer from pain related to the location of the lesion, such as abdominal, back, or suprapubic, and prolonged fever and sepsis may present related to infection. Some common pathogens of myotic aneurysms are Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Salmonella 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Due to the high frequency of Staphylococcus aureus, it is essential to administer anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus drugs such as vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (TMP-SMZ), quinupristin-dalfopristin, clindamycin, and tigecycline as empiric therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Gram-negative bacilli, including enterobacteria, are increasing and now comprise a major proportion of intra-abdominal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Imaging modalities play a pivotal role in the early diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of mycotic aneurysms and their complications. A CT scan is the best diagnostic tool for the diagnosis, as the symptoms of a vascular-enteric fistula include effacement or blurred borders of fatty planes around arteries, soft tissue collection around the artery >5 mm, ectopic gas within or adjacent to the artery, intravenous contrast within the gastrointestinal lumen or around the artery, and intestinal wall thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The presence of ectopic bowel gas or extravasation of contrast into the bowel lumen is 100% specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In this case, apart from the imaging features of an infected aneurysm, the CT scan also revealed that the anterior wall of the aneurysm had adhered to the posterior wall of the sigmoid colon. Associated with the symptoms of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, it strongly suggested a vascular-colonic fistula. Although some findings of a mycotic aneurysm may be noted on an MRI, such as mural edema and surrounding fat stranding, it is inferior to a CT scan because of the risk of artifact, small volume coverage, and unreliable detection of the presence of aortic extraluminal gas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10\\]</u>. Doppler ultrasonography in the diagnosis of an infected aneurysm is not as reliable as a CT scan or MRI and is limited to assessing deep structures. Angiography is rarely used as the first-line imaging modality; however, it may be helpful for surgical planning in certain cases or used to treat massive gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to vascular-enteric fistula by embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Colonoscopy is also a useful modality for the diagnosis, as it may be useful in detecting hemorrhage and erosion of the intestinal wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Conservative management is associated with poor outcomes, including a mortality rate of 50% and a 1-year survival rate of only 32% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Prompt diagnosis and timely treatment are necessary for patient recovery. Treatment management may include antibiotic therapy for controlling sepsis, surgery, and endovascular therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5\\]</u>. The operative technique or endovascular treatment depends on several factors, such as aneurysm location, the extent of the infection, the fitness of the patient, complications, and the surgeon’s preference 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, the operation was divided into two steps: vascular reconstruction and gastrointestinal repair. In the first step, to diminish the risk of graft infection, the vascular surgeon decided to create a bypass graft and remove the aneurysm. In the second step, the GI surgeon resected the sigmoid colon and formed a stoma in the lower-left quadrant.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】A mycotic aneurysm is unusual, and its complication with iliac artery aneurysmo-colonic fistulas is even rarer. The clinical onset of this disease is unpredictable and can present with mild symptoms to life-threatening hemorrhage due to ruptured aneurysms. Imaging modalities are essential for the early diagnosis and assessment of mycotic aneurysms and their complications and, therefore, the treatment orientation of clinicians and surgeons.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Excessive nitrous oxide inhalation has been shown to cause a functional vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia, which can lead to peripheral neuropathy and hypercoagulability, respectively. While the development of neurologic toxicity from chronic nitrous oxide abuse (i.e. encephalopathy, myelopathy, and neuropathy) has been previously described, the thrombotic potential of chronic nitrous oxide abuse is less known. The authors report two cases of nitrous oxide abuse leading to both neurologic and thrombotic complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Inhaled nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), also known colloquially as “whippets,” was traditionally used in the medical and dental fields for its anesthetic effects. It was first described by Humphry Davy in 1800, and at that time, the drug had already been widely used recreationally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. More than 200 hundred years later, the lifetime prevalence of nitrous oxide use was found to be 23.5% of over 120,000 survey responders from more than 30 countries according to the Global Drug Survey 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Nitrous oxide abuse has also become highly prevalent in the younger populations because of its euphoric and antianxiety effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In addition to its euphoric effects, inhaled nitrous oxide can classically cause neurologic symptoms (e.g. numbness) by causing a functional B12 deficiency. Rarely, inhaled nitrous oxide can also lead to hypercoagulability, believed to be secondary to hyperhomocysteinemia. In this case series, we report two patients who developed both neurologic and thrombotic complications in the setting of chronic nitrous oxide abuse.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentations\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 22-year-old healthy man with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with lower extremity swelling and was found to have a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right popliteal, tibial, and peroneal veins. He was discharged home on rivaroxaban. He presented to the emergency department again two days later with a chief complaint of right groin pain and ataxia. His ataxia started one week prior to presentation, along with frequent falls, bilateral foot numbness, and urinary retention. He has endorsed daily nitrous oxide “whippets” use for the last two years, using multiple canisters in a day. On physical examination, his heart rate was high at 120 beats per minute. On neurologic examination, he was found to have proximal muscle weakness in the lower extremities with 3/5 strength bilaterally and 3+ hyperreflexia of the patellar and plantar tendons. Laboratory studies revealed a megaloblastic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL (normal 13.7–17.5 g/dL), an MCV of 100 fl (normal 79.0–92.0 fl), a homocysteine level of 67.9 micromol/liter (normal less than 16 micromol/liter), methylmalonic acid of 2.417 micromol/liter, and vitamin B12 of 187 pg/mL (normal 213–816 pg/mL). Peripheral smear showed hypersegmented neutrophils . Computed tomography (CT) angiography showed extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism involving the right middle, right lower, left upper, and left lower lobar pulmonary arteries . Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine with contrast was performed, and the axial T-2 weighted images suggested areas of cord signal abnormality, but this was likely artifactual. An extensive evaluation of hypercoagulability was performed: negative prothrombin mutation, Factor-V Leiden mutation, rheumatoid factor (RF), ANA, anti-dsDNA, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-B2gp1 antibody, and normal antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S levels. The patient had a heterozygous mutation for methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase of the C677T genotype. This genotype is not thought to be associated with excess thrombotic risk; however, actual risk may be modified by synergistic interactions with other factors. He was treated with rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, intramuscular vitamin B12 1,000 mcg weekly, and oral vitamin B12 500 mcg daily. At his two-month follow-up visit, he had stopped using nitrous oxide, had normal gait and strength, and had a vitamin B12 level of 1649 pg/mL. He was subsequently lost to follow-up.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Peripheral smear showing hypersegmented neutrophils consistent with megaloblastic anemia from vitamin B12 deficiency.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli seen on chest CT angiogram.</u>\n\n【10】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【11】A 38-year-old man with a past medical history of seizure disorder presented to the emergency department with one day of acute shortness of breath. He admitted to long term use of nitrous oxide abuse but could not quantify his use. The night prior to presentation, he reported using 25 cartridges of nitrous oxide. On presentation, he complained of bilateral lower extremity paresthesias, urinary retention, and low back pain; however, he also reported falling down a flight of stairs two months prior. In the emergency department, the patient’s initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 133/92 mmHg; heart rate, 117 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/minute; temperature, 37.3 C oral, and O<sub>2</sub> Sat 99% on RA. His laboratory studies were significant for megaloblastic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL (normal 13.7–17.5 g/dL), MCV of 105.8 fl (normal 79.0–92.0 fl), vitamin B12 of less than 146 pg/mL (normal 213–816 pg/mL), a methylmalonic acid level of 8.92 μmol/L (0.00–0.40 μmol/L), and a homocysteine level of 127 μmol/L (normal less than 16 μmol/L). COVID-19 PCR was negative. The patient did not undergo any additional hypercoagulability workup, as it was presumed that his venous thromboembolisms were due to his chronic nitrous oxide use. A lower extremity venous duplex showed DVTs of the left popliteal vein and right popliteal vein extending into the right distal superficial femoral vein. A CT angiography showed bilateral central pulmonary emboli with right ventricular septal flattening and he was started on a heparin infusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine was performed and revealed an abnormal signal in the posterior columns of the cervical cord and an abnormal signal, more centrally located, in the thoracic cord . On discharge, he was continued on rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, methionine 1 g three times per day, folic acid 1 mg daily, oral vitamin B12 1,000 mcg daily, and intramuscular vitamin B12 1,000 mcg weekly, which were discontinued after three months. The homocysteine level decreased to 14 μmol/L on day 7, and at 2-month follow-up, it was 10 μmol/L.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 MRI of the cervical spine showing abnormal signal in the posterior columns.</u>\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Nitrous oxide, also known as “laughing gas,” is used medically for its analgesic and sedative properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Its rapid onset, short duration, and ability to cause euphoria make it an appealing recreational drug of abuse. Inhalation of nitrous oxide can lead to death due to simple asphyxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. With prolonged and heavy use of nitrous oxide, significant neurologic sequelae may manifest secondary to a vitamin B12 deficiency. Clinical effects of this functional vitamin B12 deficiency include numbness, weakness, ataxia, polyneuropathy, bone marrow suppression, and megaloblastic anemia. Although rare, nitrous oxide abuse can also be associated with a hypercoagulable state, secondary to hyperhomocysteinemia. Here, we describe two cases of chronic nitrous oxide abuse that presented with hyperhomocysteinemia, greater than four times the upper limit of normal, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Both patients were found to have neurologic and hematologic pathologies.\n\n【15】Nitrous oxide inactivates vitamin B12 through oxidation of the cobalt moiety. This leads to indirect irreversible inhibition of methionine synthase, which is an enzyme that converts homocysteine to methionine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. When inhibited, homocysteine accumulates and leads to hyperhomocysteinemia. Homocysteine is an amino acid not supplied by the diet that, when elevated, has been associated with various cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Nitrous oxide abuse has been associated with thromboembolic diseases, such as pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and aortic arch thrombus. In all of these cases, the patients had hyperhomocysteinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Hyperhomocysteinemia can be caused by genetic polymorphisms, such as the thermolabile variant of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, hypothyroidism, and cigarette smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Both of our patients were cigarette smokers, potentially contributing to the observed hyperhomocysteinemia. Our patient in the first case underwent an extensive hypercoaguability workup, which was unrevealing. This presentation was years prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; therefore, SARS-CoV-2 was not considered as a cause for hypercoaguability. When investigating the etiology of hypercoaguability, it is important to evaluate for conditions such as Factor-V Leiden thrombophilia, the presence of prothrombin gene mutations, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S deficiencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The patient in case two did not undergo additional hypercoaguability workup, as it was postulated that the patient’s hyperhomocysteinemia was the cause of his provoked venous thromboses.\n\n【17】With cessation of nitrous oxide use, supplemental vitamin B12, and anticoagulation, both patients made meaningful recoveries with normalization of homocysteine and vitamin B12 levels. We postulate that chronic nitrous oxide abuse led to vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia and ultimately the occurrence of both neurologic effects and pulmonary embolism in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Its etiology is unknown. It has been rarely linked with schizophrenia and head injury. Case Presentation. We describe an unusual case of a 44-year-old female with schizophrenia and hyperostosis frontalis interna having a history of head trauma. At the age of 3 years, she had a head injury that could be classified as mild traumatic brain injury. She presents a family history of schizophrenia. She was admitted for resistant schizophrenic disorder. The cranial computed tomography showed bilateral and asymmetrical hyperostosis of the frontal bone that was more pronounced on the right side. This corresponds to the impact of the trauma with frontal atrophy without any metabolic or endocrinal abnormalities. Conclusion. We surmise that the long-term pathological effects of traumatic brain injury, including hyperostosis frontalis interna, are likely to interact with genetic vulnerability and may lead to schizophrenic disorder.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hyperostosis frontalis interna (HFI) is an irregular thickening of the frontal bone that is generally presented as single or multiple bilateral nodules on the inner lamina, while diploe and external lamina of the bone remain unaffected. Its mode of formation and growth is unknown. It has been linked with many symptoms. Two syndromes have been described in association with it. Morgagni’s syndrome consists of HFI and both obesity and hirsutism and the Stewart-Morel syndrome comprises neuropsychiatric symptoms and headache.\n\n【4】Here, we describe an unusual and interesting case of schizophrenia and hyperostosis frontalis interna (HFI) having a history of head injury without metabolic or endocrine dysfunctions.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】In this report, we describe an unusual case of a 44-year- old female with hyperostosis of the frontal bone. The patient is a single Moroccan female with a university degree and living with her parents. She showed normal psychomotor development during early childhood.\n\n【7】At the age of 3 years, she had a head injury. She fell on a sharp object that caused frontal head impact . The bleeding was stopped at home with traditional first aid. She was somnolent on the day of trauma.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Scar of head injury.</u>\n\n【9】Prior to this incident, she had never been examined nor had she undergone any neurological tests, despite the persistence of moderate headaches.\n\n【10】She was a sociable child and had no issues in her adolescence. Family history revealed that her sister was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n\n【11】The schizophrenic symptoms of our patient began when she was 22 years old. She was hospitalized and received antipsychotic treatment.\n\n【12】The evolution was marked by very short remissions and numerous relapses due to treatment discontinuation.\n\n【13】With time, the symptoms appeared resistant and severe. She had major anxiety, depersonalization, derealization, and obsessive symptoms. She presented audiovisual hallucinations with mental automatism, persecution delusion, reasoning difficulties, impaired judgment, sexual disinhibition, and emotional impulses. These were associated with several suicide attempts that did not involve sadness in her mood.\n\n【14】Psychometric evaluations revealed scores of 102 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia  and 9/10 on the clock drawing test (CDT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. A neurological examination showed normal findings.\n\n【15】Table 1 Patient’s PANSS subscale score.\n\n【16】In the context of therapeutic resistance, cranial computed tomography was carried out. The results showed bilateral and asymmetrical hyperostosis of the frontal bone that was more pronounced on the right side.

Laboratory tests did not show metabolic or endocrinal abnormalities like imbalanced sexual hormones and thyroid function. She had no history of epilepsy and the electroencephalography did not show any abnormal activity.\n\n【19】We could not carry out further treatments, including administering clozapine and electroconvulsive therapy. During a 10-day treatment with clozapine, she developed severe diarrhea without fever or any infective cause. Moreover, her family refused electroconvulsive therapy.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】HFI has been identified in antiquity and has increased during the last century, especially among young individuals. It has been shown to be more common and more severe in females. It is usually an incidental finding on imaging, for example, in X-ray, cranial computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【22】It is considered an independent condition that is benign and incidental, although in some reports it has been associated with many conditions, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, headaches, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric or behavioral disorders. The etiology of HFI remains unknown, but it is generally related to an endocrine imbalance, especially in pituitary function. However, to our knowledge, only one report attributed HFI to head trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Our patient presented with an unusual association of resistant psychotic symptoms, head injury, family history of schizophrenia, and HFI. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether there is a relationship between schizophrenia, head injury, and HFI.\n\n【24】We assume that the head injury of our patient might be one of the reported risk factors of HFI, especially because this is more developed on the side of the trauma. Moreover, our patient did not present any metabolic or endocrinal abnormalities. The head injury in the other reported case was more severe than in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The literature has reported traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a source of neuroendocrine disturbances. Patients can develop hypopituitarism in the postacute phase of a TBI and it may normalize later; however, it may recur after the postacute phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This suggests that TBI could contribute to the formation of HFI through hypopituitarism. However, in our case, we do not have enough evidence to confirm that the traumatic event can be defined as TBI. Children may be unable to report some symptoms immediately after traumatic events, such as sensory problems, confusion, or headaches. Somnolence could indicate cerebral damage, while headache is a common and persistent symptom following mild TBI. The trauma in our case could be classified as mild TBI.\n\n【26】Several papers have noted an association between severity of HFI and the cortical atrophy with severity of psychotic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Some authors have observed that prognosis did not seem to be affected by HFI, and the clinical outcome was in accordance with the psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n【27】The problem regarding our patient lies is in distinguishing whether the onset of schizophrenic disorder was a consequence of HFI; is related to childhood TBI; or that the co-occurrence of schizophrenic disorders, head injury in childhood and later development of HFI is just a coincidence, especially that the available literature has suggested that there is an increased risk of schizophrenia following TBI, with a larger effect in individuals from families with an elevated genetic predisposition to psychosis. Furthermore, some studies have supported that childhood trauma may have a causative role in some presentations of psychosis. The explanation for this long latency from injury to onset of illness may be related to the neurodevelopmental theory of schizophrenia.\n\n【28】Head injury, HFI, and schizophrenia are important factors that must be considered when interpreting frontal atrophy in the case of our patient. The longest follow-up TBI studies have supported that there is a brain volume loss in a patient with chronic brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The neuroinﬂammatory reactions following TBI may play a role in the progression of degenerative brain changes for months to years after injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Similarly, May et al. noted that the presence of HFI suggests a decrease in brain volume and has major clinical signiﬁcance as it may indicate the beginning of degenerative processes of the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, in our case, it is difficult to ascertain the direction of this relationship because the patient underwent a scan only once, without being examined by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, which limited the possibility of drawing conclusions about causal relationships.\n\n【30】On the other hand, patients with untreated schizophrenia lasting 5 to 47 years had less cortical thickness relative to healthy people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【31】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【32】Finally, we suggest that all these factors (head injury, HFI, and schizophrenia) contribute to cerebral atrophy, severity, and resistant psychotic symptoms in our case.\n\n【33】This observation indicates that even mild head injuries have the potential to initiate a cascade of neuropathological events that reduce brain reserve capacity and increase vulnerability for neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\n【34】In conclusion, we surmise that the long-term pathological effects of TBI including HFI may represent an additional causal factor that can interact with genetic vulnerability and may lead to schizophrenic disorder.\n\n【35】#### Abbreviations\n\n| HFI: | Hyperostosis frontalis interna |\n| --- | --- |\n| TBI: | Traumatic brain injury |\n| PANSS: | Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale |\n| CDT: | Clock drawing test. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Brown tumor is a localized form of osteitis fibrosa cystica, being part of the hyperparathyroid bone disease. It is rarely the first symptom of hyperparathyroidism. Nowadays, the diagnosis is made at an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic stage. We present a male patient presented with a massive painless swelling in the left maxilla as the first manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroidectomy was performed, and there was a regression of the bone lesion, without the need of performing other local surgical procedures.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The most common cause of hypercalcemia is hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in outpatients. Incidence of PHPT is 2-3/1000 in women and 1/1000 in men. The disease is most frequent in postmenopausal women during the sixth decade of life, although it is seen in all age groups. Of patients with PHPT, 80–85% develop the disease due to parathyroid adenoma, 15–20% due to hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland, while in less than 0.5%, the cause is parathyroid carcinoma. Brown tumor is a reactive lesion in the bone tissue, very rarely seen during the course of PHPT and is secondary to localized rapid osteoclastic bone turnover resulting from the direct effect of parathormone. Hemorrhage, vascular fibrous tissue, and resultant granulation tissue replace normal bone marrow elements. Localized accumulation of fibrous tissues and giant cells results in bone expansion. These are reversible tissues with excision of the parathyroid adenoma or removal of the four glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 23-year-old male patient with no known additional disease history has noticed about 10 months ago a painless swelling first on the left side of his face which gradually generalized and presented to the dental clinic. The patient was treated with antibiotics for a while. When the swelling in the patient’s face persisted despite the treatment, biopsy was performed to the affected part of the face. The patient was referred to our hospital for advanced examinations after the pathologic analyses demonstrated giant-cell reparative granuloma.\n\n【6】Physical examination of the patient revealed no additional pathologies other than the swelling in the left maxillary region. Upon noticing considerably increased levels of alkaline phosphatase and blood calcium and considerably decreased levels of blood phosphor (calcium: 14.6 mg/dL, phosphor: 2 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase: 702 U/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(70–290)</u>) in the results of the requested analyses, the patient was hospitalized at our clinic for emergency hypercalcemia treatment and advanced analyses. The patient was initiated on isotonic 5 L/day and furosemide infusion for emergency treatment. Zoledronic acid 4 mg vial infusion was started as the calcium values did not decrease despite the treatment. With this treatment, patient’s blood calcium levels returned to normal levels (Ca: 9.5 mg/dL) on the second day of the treatment. Because primary hyperparathyroidism was considered as the diagnosis of the patient when initiating the emergency treatment, intact parathormone (IPTH) and 24-hour urine calcium levels were requested from the laboratory. The results were indeed significantly high, supportive of our prediagnosis; IPTH: 1302 pg/mL 通用删除7(英):<u>(15–65)</u> and 24-hour urine calcium: 617.5 mg/24 h. Although our diagnosis was confirmed biochemically, neck ultrasound and parathyroid scintigraphy (sestamibi scintigraphy) were requested to localize the adenoma in the patient. In addition, cranial MRI including the face was scheduled to fully understand the facial lesion radiologically and to be able to follow up after the planned surgery. The neck ultrasound revealed a  mm lesion containing a  mm hypoechoic space in the thyroid left lobe inferior. Expansile, remodeling, and multicentric osseous lesions of multilocular septate appearance localized at bilateral maxillary and left ramus-corpus mandibula, the largest of which was localized in left maxillofacial bones, were detected on cranial MRI analysis . Parathyroid sestamibi scintigraphy results were consistent with parathyroid adenoma . These findings confirmed the primary hyperparathyroidism diagnosis of the patient. The patient, after achieving reductions in blood calcium with emergency treatment, was referred to surgery. Total excision of the parathyroid adenoma guided by gamma probe was performed in the patient. The lesion in the maxillofacial region was judged to be Brown tumor secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism, based on both biopsy and radiographic findings. This lesion was monitored without any intervention. Presence of Brown tumor in other bones was investigated through long bone graphy and extremities and cranial direct graphies. No foci suggestive of another Brown tumor were identified. The pathology report was also consistent with parathyroid adenoma. Hungry bone syndrome developed following the surgery: PTH < 3 pg/mL and Ca: 8.2 mg/dL. The patient was administrated i.v. calcium treatment for two days and was initiated on calcitriol 0.5 tbl. calcium tbl.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Cranial MR: multicentric osseous lesions in left maxillofacial bones. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Sestamibi scintigraphy: parathyroid adenoma. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】Regression in the Brown tumor localized in the left maxillary region was observed during followup .

Discussion\n\n【12】Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrinologic condition following diabetes mellitus and thyroid diseases. Its annual incidence has been reported as 28/100.000 in the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Improper or excessive secretion of PTH results in PHPT. Of patients with PHPT, 80–85% develop the disease due to parathyroid adenoma, 15–20% due to hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland, while in less than 0.5% the cause is parathyroid carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A single adenoma indicates sporadic disease, while hyperplasia of four glands suggests familial diseases (MEN type 1 or 2A). Its diagnosis is usually based on serum calcium and PTH levels higher than normal limits. In some cases, blood calcium levels within normal limits may also be observed. Today, patients with PHPT can be diagnosed in the early and asymptomatic period owing to the advances in the blood analysis methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Although many systems are affected in PHPT, the most pronounced alternations are observed in the bone. Approximately 2% of the patients are reported to develop osteitis fibrosa cystica, and 0.8% develop Brown tumor. These figures suggest a very low frequency of Brown tumors in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Brown tumor is the localized form of osteitis fibrosa cystica 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and is a reactive lesion in the bone tissue, very rarely seen during the course of PHPT. The tumor is secondary to localized rapid osteoclastic bone turnover resulting from the direct effect of PTH. Hemorrhage, vascular fibrous tissue, and resultant granulation tissue replace normal bone marrow elements. Localized accumulation of fibrous tissues and giant cells results in bone expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Brown tumors are primarily observed in face, mandible and neck region, followed by the pelvis, ribs, and femur. Axial skeleton is rarely involved. They may occasionally cause pathologic fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Primary treatment of Brown tumors is surgical removal of associated parathyroid pathology. Brown tumors generally regress spontaneously over time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Return of serum PTH, calcium, and phosphor levels to normal limits is an indicator of the success of treatment. Increases in bone mineral mass during the consequent period may also represent a significant indicator 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The patient may first present with the complaint of painless mass in the maxillary region, as was the case in our patient. There are very few cases in the literature describing Brown tumor localized in the maxillary and facial regions in primary hyperparathyroidism. Diagnosis may be easily overlooked in such cases. Therefore, we must consider primary hyperparathyroidism in differential diagnosis by analyzing blood calcium and PTH levels of patients presenting with mass in bones, particularly in the face. Establishing an accurate diagnosis will eliminate patient’s problem through the surgery of the parathyroid gland and will avoid more advanced surgical interventions. It should be kept in mind that there may be a regression in the Brown tumor over years, as is the case in our patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Acupuncture is a form of complementary medicine and has gained popularity worldwide in the last few decades. It is mainly used for the treatment of chronic pain. Acupuncture is usually considered a safe procedure but has been reported to cause serious complications including death. It has been associated with transmission of many viruses and bacteria. Two cases of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus have been reported recently following acupuncture therapy. We are reporting a case of a 57-year-old Korean female who developed vertebral osteomyelitis and intraspinal and paraspinal abscesses as a complication of acupuncture. Blood cultures, skin lesion culture, and body fluid culture yielded Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Good anatomical and medical knowledge, good hygiene standards, and proper acupuncture techniques should be followed to prevent the complications. Acupuncturists should consistently review the infection control guidelines to acupuncture. This case should raise awareness of such condition and hazards of presumably benign procedures such as acupuncture.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Acupuncture in Latin words means “acus” (needle) and “puncture” (penetration). Acupuncture is one of the oldest medical procedures in the world and originated in China about 2,000 years ago. In United States it appeared in the early 18th century but gained popularity after 1971 when New York Times journalist, James Reston, reported his experience with acupuncture. He was visiting China for President Nixon’s visit. He had an emergency appendectomy in China and was given acupuncture for postoperative analgesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Acupuncture is mainly used for the treatment of chronic pain such as back pain, neck pain, and joint pain and for conditions like fatigue, insomnia, and depression. However, acupuncture, presumably a benign procedure, is related to the transmission of infectious agents and can cause devastating complications. We are reporting a first case of community acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acute osteomyelitis with intraspinal and multiple paraspinal abscesses related to acupuncture.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 57-year-old Korean female presented with complaints of two-day history of nausea, vomiting, and generalized weakness along with subjective fever and night sweats. The patient also complained of intermittent chronic back pain for years that worsened over last week and made her go to have acupuncture therapy for the first time two days priorly for her chronic back pain but unfortunately pain got worse. Her physical examination revealed tenderness in the lumbosacral region without any redness or erythema. Laboratory tests showed normal white count with bands of 34% (normal range: 0–5%). Chest X-ray showed patchy opacities in the bilateral lower lung fields. Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【6】The next day after admission the patient developed urinary retention. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar spine was done to rule out disc herniation, which instead showed enlargement of the right psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles with induration of paraspinal soft tissue. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine showed fluid in the soft tissues posteriorly, which was reported as nonspecific but could be related to acupuncture.\n\n【7】Blood cultures came back positive for MRSA and only Vancomycin was continued. The patient developed multiple 2 mm new skin pustules over her legs and cultures from the skin lesions were also positive for MRSA. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram failed to show any vegetation. A chest CT and abdominal MRI were done to discover the occult source of infection. The chest CT showed multiple necrotizing nodules suggestive of septic emboli. The abdomen MRI showed fluid collection posterolateral to the right psoas muscle, which was likely due to abscess formation. Multiple new small microabscesses in the paraspinal muscles and early osteomyelitis of the L2 vertebral body were also reported 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u>. A new small (0.6 × 0.5 cm) intraspinal fluid collection was also seen at the L2 vertebral body. CT-guided aspiration of the right paraspinal abscess was done and cultures were sent, which came back positive for MRSA as well. The patient was continued on Vancomycin.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 MRI lumbar spine. (a) MRI of the lumbar spine with contrast showing L2 vertebral osteomyelitis. (b) MRI of the lumbar spine showing paraspinal abscess. (c) Follow-up MRI of the lumbar spine showing resolution of the osteomyelitis and the paraspinal abscesses.</u>\n\n【9】MRI and CT of the lumbar spine after four weeks of antibiotic therapy again demonstrated osteomyelitis of the L2 vertebra. The paraspinal fluid collections demonstrated interval decrease in size and resolution of the intraspinal fluid collection. The patient reported improvement of back pain and was discharged on a 12-week course of intravenous Vancomycin. An MRI of the lumbar spine 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u> eight weeks following antibiotic therapy showed significant improvement of osteomyelitis and almost complete resolution of abscesses. The delayed CT scan showed complete resolution of abscesses. During a follow-up visit the patient stated that her back pain had resolved.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Acupuncture is gaining popularity as a common therapeutic procedure for chronic pain control in the United States. However, due to failure to follow infection control guidelines for acupuncture therapy (Australian Acupuncture Association Limited, 1997) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, there has been transmission of various infectious agents . A review of the literature revealed that infectious agents such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus in 1988 and 1993 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>, Human Immunodeficiency Virus in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, Mycobacteria in 2001 and 2002 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>, Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in 1997, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>, and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 2008 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u> were reported to have been transmitted by acupuncture. Now in 2015 we are reporting a first case of acupuncture associated MRSA acute vertebral osteomyelitis with intraspinal and multiple paraspinal abscesses.\n\n【12】Table 1 Infectious complications related to acupuncture (MSSA and MRSA).\n\n【13】Along with infectious complications, acupuncture is also known to be associated with mechanical organ injuries. Three deaths have been reported in which acupuncture was claimed as the cause, with one patient who died from endocarditis, another from bilateral pneumothorax, and a third due to severe asthma during acupuncture therapy. The adverse effects of acupuncture can be prevented with sound anatomical and medical knowledge, proper hygiene practices, and adequate acupuncture education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Vertebral osteomyelitis is classified as being acute, subacute, or chronic. Acute osteomyelitis develops in a few days or weeks while subacute or chronic occurs over weeks to months before treatment is initiated. Vertebral osteomyelitis occurs via hematogenous, direct inoculation, or contagious transmission. The lumbar spine is most commonly involved (58%), followed by the thoracic spine (30%) and the cervical spine (11%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Patients with vertebral osteomyelitis usually present with back pain and fever and may have some form of neurologic deficit. MRI has a high sensitivity (96%) and specificity (92%) for diagnosing vertebral osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However, response to treatment is determined by clinical assessment and inflammatory markers since radiologic improvement by MRI is delayed and always follows clinical improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Follow-up MRI is only indicated when there are no signs of clinical improvement after four weeks of therapy or an abscess is suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【16】A high index of clinical suspicion is required for vertebral osteomyelitis since the presentation can be very vague. Early imaging studies and empiric antibiotic therapy covering MRSA should be initiated to prevent serious complications, since Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism causing vertebral osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Treatment duration for osteomyelitis is generally recommended for six weeks but a longer course should be considered in complicated infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. In the present case, the patient received parenteral Vancomycin for three months and CT-guided aspiration of paraspinal abscess which resulted in a favorable outcome.\n\n【17】In the present case, back pain worsened over weeks which is the natural course of mechanical low back pain but having acute worsening after acupuncture directly suggests that bacterial inoculation at the time of procedure which was further complicated by bacteremia although there was no local skin abscess at the site of acupuncture temporal correlation is evident. The patient had been in the United States for years and this was her first hospitalization and she did not have any other medical problem suggesting that she could be carrier for MRSA so it was assumed that this infection was acquired from acupuncture as reported from previous literature.\n\n【18】To best of our knowledge, only two cases of MRSA associated with acupuncture have been reported in the literature to date. Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported acupuncture associated MRSA necrotizing aortitis in April 2008 and Woo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported MRSA causing septic arthritis following acupuncture in August 2008. We are reporting a third case of MRSA associated with acupuncture. However, this is the first case of MRSA associated vertebral osteomyelitis with spinal and paraspinal abscesses.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】Vertebral osteomyelitis and/or abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis in a patient presenting with worsening back pain following acupuncture therapy. Diagnoses of vertebral osteomyelitis can easily be missed or delayed due to its vague presentation. Careful history taking and early initiation of therapy is of paramount importance for a favorable outcome. Acupuncturists should possess sound anatomical and medical knowledge and adhere to proper hygiene standards and techniques with consistent review of the infection control guidelines pertaining to acupuncture to prevent the devastating complications and significant financial expenditure due to prolonged hospitalization. This case raises awareness of the possible hazards of presumably benign procedures such as acupuncture.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This clinical entity is often underdiagnosed as it may be mistaken for other differential diagnoses, such as pedunculated myoma or adnexal lesions. Imaging modalities, including ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), accompanied with relevant and suspicious clinical findings are important tools in making acorrect diagnosis. To date, surgical excision of the mass remains the mainstay of treatment,which provides significant symptom relief. In this study, we present a female adolescent with chronic pelvic pain since menarche who underwent laparotomy with the presumed diagnosis of a left-sided ovarian mass. Retrospective evaluation of pelvic MR images demonstrated that the lesion was in fact an ACUM, which was further confirmed by histopathological examination.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Accessory and cavitated uterine mass (ACUM) is a rare newly described Mullerian anomaly, which generally presents with chronic recurrent pelvic pain and/or severe dysmenorrhea in women younger than 30 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is an accessory mass at the insertion of the round ligament that is lined by normal endometrium and has a dark-brown-colored fluid content 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. ACUMs are difficult to diagnose because of their broad differential diagnosis, which includes rudimentary and cavitated uterine horns such as those found in other uterine malformations (e.g. bicornuate uterus), adenomyosis with cystic or degenerated areas, degenerated leiomyomas, and essential and primary dysmenorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, fewer than 60 cases of ACUM are reported in the literature at the time of writing this paper. In this case report, we describe a 14-year-old girl presenting with severe pelvic pain since her menarche. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an apparent adnexal mass, but final histopathological examination was in favor of ACUM.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 14-year-old girl presented with chronic recurrent pelvic pain since her menarche. Her pain aggravated monthly during her menstruation; however, she had a regular and normal menstrual flow. Her personal history and family history were not significant, and she had no previous sexual history. Different kinds of anti-inflammatory medications had been prescribed for her during the past two years. The patient had also received oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for two months, but none of the medications had been significantly effective. On physical examination, she was a well-developed girl with normal vital signs. She showed normal pubertal development with a height of 160 centimeters (percentile: 47%) and weight of 48 kilograms (percentile: 43%), and normal adrenarche and thelarche (stage 4). Pelvic examination of the external genitalia was normal with no evidence of imperforated hymen. No definite palpable mass was detected during abdominal examination. Ultrasonography was requested, which showed normal size and myometrial echogenicity of the uterus with normal endometrial thickness. There was evidence of a left-sided heterogeneous and mostly hyperechoic 35 × 30 mm adnexal mass with close contact to the left ovary . Color Doppler showed some internal vascularity. A small right-sided simple ovarian cyst was also seen on ultrasound. The cervix and vaginal canal were unremarkable on imaging. For further characterization of the mentioned lesion, pelvic MRI was performed, which revealed a well-defined heterogeneous mass with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and low-to-intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images with significant enhancement after administration of gadolinium. The mass was located on the left side of the pelvic cavity, close to the left ovary and uterus; however, no connection to the uterus or ovary was detected. There was no pelvic lymphadenopathy or ascites. Based on the imaging findings, a paraovarian mass or a myoma was suspected. Subsequently, the patient underwent laparotomy, and a well-defined fleshy mass was seen on the left side of the pelvic cavity. The mass was located just under the round ligament, close to but separated from the left ovary with no adhesion to the surrounding structures. Both ovaries and uterus were normal except for a simple right-sided ovarian cyst with no endometrial implants. The uterus had two normally developed fallopian tubes with no fundal impression or contour abnormality and two normal cornua. On close observation, the uterus was completely separated from the mentioned mass. Several collateral vessels arising from the left uterine artery, which provided arterial supply to the mass, were ligated during surgery to obtain hemostasis. Frozen section revealed normal myometrial muscle with reactive endometrium. Finally, the mass was successfully resected by enucleation and incision through the serosa. While performing complete excision, a chocolate-colored fluid flowed out from the mass. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged one day after surgery. She continued to be asymptomatic with complete resolution of the cyclic pelvic pain after one year of follow-up. Gross evaluation of the pelvic mass revealed a cavitated mass with a thick muscular wall, and pathological examination showed normal irregular myometrium lined by functional endometrium . Thus, a final diagnosis of accessory and cavitated uterine mass was made. Retrospective re-evaluation of pelvic MRI demonstrated a well-defined mass with signal intensity similar to the uterus on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences with central hypersignal endometrium and normal endometrial-myometrial interface .\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) On ultrasound, sagittal view of the pelvis shows the uterus with a normal uterine contour and normal echogenic endometrial line (arrow).

Discussion\n\n【11】Genitourinary development results from a complex interaction between the Wolffian ducts and the Mullerian ducts. Mullerian ducts are formed through invagination of the dorsal coelomic epithelium at about gestational week 6. At around 10 to 12 weeks of gestation, the two Mullerian ducts, fused with each other in a craniocaudal direction,finally fuse with the urogenital sinus, forming the uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes and the upper one-third of the vagina consequently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Mullerian anomalies are deviations from normal anatomy resulting from distortion of the complex embryogenesis. Although these anomalies are usually benign conditions, they may lead to significant reproductive problems based on the degree as well as the type of maldevelopment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. These commonly occurring anomalies can be found in about 4–7% of the population; so, an effective and reliable classification of Mullerian anomalies can contribute to proper diagnosis and management of affected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Mullerian anomalies were classified by Acien and colleagues in 1992 for the first time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>; however, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and the European Society for Gynecological Endoscopy (ESHRE/ESGE) recently updated the classification system of female genital anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In this categorization, the main classes are designed on the basis of deviations from normal uterine anatomy deriving from the same embryological origin, while the clinical significance and degree of deformity are the basis for subclasses classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Uterine-like mass (ULM) is a distinct clinical entity defined as a cavitated mass lined with functional endometrium that is composed of sex hormone-sensitive smooth muscle cells, which are arranged irregularly at the periphery of the mass. These masses can be located within the uterus or anywhere else outside the uterus. ACUM, a subtype of non communicating ULM, is a rare newly described anomaly that, unlike other Mullerian anomalies, is associated with an otherwise normal uterus; hence, it should be classified as a separate entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Persistence or duplication of Mullerian duct due to a gubernaculum dysfunction at the site of round ligament attachment has been postulated as the pathogenesis of ACUM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The same appearing masses have been described in the literature by different names, including cavitated adenomyoma, accessory cavitated mass, and juvenile cystic adenomyoma. However, ACUM is different from cystic adenomyosis, which usually occurs in middle-aged women, and is characterized by diffusely distributed adenomyotic foci within the uterus. Also, cystic adenomyosis lacks the normal endometrium and myometrium organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The current criteria used for the diagnosis of ACUM includes: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an isolated accessory cavitated mass; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> normal uterus (endometrial cavity), tubes, and ovaries; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> surgical case with excised mass and with pathological examination; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> accessory cavity lined by endometrial epithelium with glands and stroma; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> chocolate-brown-colored fluid content; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> no adenomyosis (if uterus removed), but there could be small foci of adenomyosis in the myometrium adjacent to the accessory cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The present case fulfilled all of the diagnostic criteria for ACUM; in addition, since the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries were normal in this patient, other Mullerian anomalies were ruled out. ACUM has multiple challenging differential diagnoses, such as cavitated uterine horn with degenerated area or rudimentary uterine horn; however, imaging modalities such as hysterosalpingography, ultrasound, and especially MRI can aid in making a proper diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 12, 13\\]</u>. Although most of the reported ACUM cases are located on the right lateral wall of the uterus near the round ligament, about one-third of cases are adjacent to the left round ligament, as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Table 1 presents a summary of the main findings of patients with ACUM that have been reported in previous studies. The most common symptoms in patients with ACUM are severe dysmenorrhea and recurrent pelvic pain that may occur before, during, or after menstruation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Affected individuals usually experience severe cyclic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea due to the presence of functional accessory endometrium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Table 1 Summary of previously reported cases of ACUM regarding their clinical features and management.\n\n【19】Patients usually undergo surgical excision of the mass, and most of them have a presumed diagnosis of adnexal mass or pedunculated myoma preoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, ACUM is diagnosed when an isolated cavitated mass is resected via surgery in patients with otherwise normal uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Conclusively, ACUM is a rare Mullerian anomaly and treatable cause of severe dysmenorrhea in young females. To the best of our knowledge, most cases, as ours, are misdiagnosed before surgery, and diagnosis can only be confirmed after histopathological examination; hence, we recommend imaging modalities such as MRI for better evaluation. Pelvic MRI is highly accurate in making a diagnosis of ACUM in young women who present with early-onset dysmenorrhea and recurrent periodic pelvic pain, especially with otherwise normal uterus and ovaries. Although the true prevalence of ACUMs is not known yet, we believe that this clinical entity is in fact more common than currently thought. Thus, ACUM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with clinically relevant symptoms.\n\n【21】#### Abbreviations:\n\n| ACUM: | Accessory and cavitated uterine mass |\n| --- | --- |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| OCP: | Oral contraceptive pill |\n| ULM: | Uterine-like mass. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It classically presents as a painful orthostatic headache that is exacerbated when a patient is upright. For treatment, patients are often started on conservative options such as hydration, caffeine, bedrest, and NSAID analgesics; however, certain patients who fail these therapies may require intervention with an epidural blood patch. The epidural blood patch remains the gold standard for treating refractory postdural puncture headache. Contraindications to epidural blood patch include severe coagulopathy, patient refusal, or infection at the intended site of entry. There are no clear consensus recommendations regarding patients with a hematological malignancy and potential risk that autologous blood may seed malignant cells into the neuraxis. In this case report, we present a patient with acute myeloid leukemia who developed a postdural puncture headache after receiving subarachnoid administration of antineoplastics. The patient was refractory to conservative therapy, prompting multidisciplinary consultation and discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of proceeding with an epidural blood patch. Ultimately, the patient elected to proceed with the offered epidural blood patch which led to complete resolution of his painful headaches and did not cause any spread of malignant cells into his neuraxis or cerebral spinal fluid.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is a frequently encountered complication following any neuraxial procedure which either purposefully or inadvertently punctures the dura. Risk factors for PDPH include age less than 60, female gender, pregnancy, and the use of larger gauge or cutting needles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A dural puncture headache presents as a severe fronto-occipital headache which is orthostatic in nature, namely, symptoms are exacerbated when the patient is upright and improved when laying supine. The pathophysiology is debated; one proposal posits that upright positioning causes increased loss of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and intracranial sagging which elicits painful traction on the meninges, while an alternative mechanism suggests pain is elicited from meningeal vasodilation which is a compensatory mechanism for intracranial hypotension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Conservative treatment includes hydration, caffeine, bedrest, and abdominal binder application, along with medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen. For patients refractory to conservative treatments, an epidural blood patch (EBP) remains the most effective therapy with greater than 75% of patients reporting complete symptom resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. EBP contraindications include coagulopathy, elevated intracranial pressure, patient refusal, bacteremia, or local infection at the puncture site. In patients who are unable to receive an EBP, a sphenopalatine ganglion block via topical anesthetic may also provide relief.\n\n【4】An EBP is usually considered a low-risk procedure when autologous blood from a healthy patient is used; however, further consideration is warranted in a patient with a hematological malignancy or with immunocompromised status. The literature on this subject is sparse, and no consensus or expert recommendations exist to guide clinicians. While alternatives to autologous blood, such as donated allogenic blood, fibrin glue, or saline have been postulated, there is a paucity of data on their efficacy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A previously healthy 31-year-old male with a medical history only significant for previous polysubstance abuse presented to his local emergency department with a one-month history of night sweats, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion. Emergency department workup revealed a critical leukocytosis of 466 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (normal range = 4.5–11 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), normocytic anemia with hemoglobin of 4.1 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 18 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (normal range = 150–400 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Given concern for acute leukemia with impending blast crisis, the patient was emergently transferred to a tertiary medical center for treatment escalation. Cytoreductive therapy was initiated, and subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Induction chemotherapy was initiated, and on hospital day 28, a diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) was performed to examine for central nervous system disease. A 20-gauge cutting spinal needle was inserted at the L3-L4 level to obtain a CSF sample, and no immediate postoperative complications were noted. Wright-Giemsa staining of CSF showed blast cell formation, and intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy was initiated on day 31, and the intrathecal space was again accessed via a 20-gauge cutting spinal needle. Less than 24 hours after this procedure, our patient reported a debilitating positional headache that was brought on after sitting upright or standing for 30 minutes. He rated the pain intensity as a 9 out of 10 when upright, with complete resolution when recumbent. He endorsed that the headaches were accompanied by mild nausea but denied vision changes, photophobia, fever, and neck stiffness, and he had no focal neurologic deficits on exam. He was initiated on conservative therapy with both oral and parenteral caffeine, intravenous fluids, and acetaminophen. After 11 days of intractable postural headache pain, the Interventional Pain Service was consulted for consideration of an EBP.\n\n【7】Prior to consenting the patient for EBP, the team considered the possibility of meningitis, in addition to the risk of seeding malignant cells into the CSF. Given the presence of the characteristic postural headache and the absence of fever over the previous 11 days, the probability of meningitis was deemed to be very low. With respect to the consideration of the risk of seeding the CSF, it was noted that in contrast to the most recent CSF analysis, repeat bone marrow biopsy one day prior did not identify blast cells. After a thorough, multidisciplinary discussion ensuring his understanding of the risks, the patient decided to pursue EBP. Under fluoroscopic guidance, an 18G Tuohy needle was used to access the L3-4 epidural space via loss-of-resistance technique. Fluoroscopic contrast injection confirmed epidural placement, and the patient received a slow injection of 20 mL autologous blood . The procedure was uncomplicated, and within an hour the patient had complete resolution of symptoms. Following the successful EBP, he had three additional, uncomplicated lumbar punctures for both CSF blast cell analysis and ongoing IT chemotherapy. The subsequent CSF findings were negative for blast cells, and he did not have any further postural headaches. At time of follow-up one year later, the patient had achieved remission, remained free from substance use, and had no recurrence of postural headaches.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The L3-L4 epidural space was accessed under fluoroscopy, and correct placement was confirmed with injection of contrast.</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】The International Classification of Headache Disorders’ criterion for a PDPH diagnosis is the development of a headache within 5 days of dural puncture that either spontaneously resolves within 1 week or within 48 hours after EBP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A postural headache which worsens when upright is pathognomonic for PDPH, and the most common associated symptoms include nausea, neck stiffness, and rarely photophobia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. When evaluating a patient with a postural headache after a dural puncture, a thorough history and physical exam should be performed to rule out more insidious etiologies masquerading as PDPH, such as posterior reversible encephalopathy, subdural hematoma, cerebral venous thrombosis, or arachnoiditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Conservative management should be considered and discussed with the patient, as approximately 50% of dural puncture headaches will resolve within 4 days of dural puncture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. EBP remains the gold standard of treatment for PDPH, with resolution rates >75% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. There are limited data on the risk of seeding malignant cells into the neuraxis with autologous blood from a patient with an active hematological malignancy; thus, the decision to perform an EBP in these patients remains challenging.\n\n【12】Albeit sparse, there is literature addressing whether a patient with an active hematological malignancy is a candidate for EBP given the potential risk to seed the neuraxis with autologous blood containing malignant cells. Strand et al. retrospectively reported outcomes of 19 hematologic malignancy patients who underwent EBP and found that one patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subsequently developed a biopsy-confirmed DLBCL brain lesion following EBP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, the authors suggest that its location on the corpus callosum make the epidural or intrathecal spaces an unlikely anatomical point of origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Demaree et al. conducted a retrospective review of 18 leukemia and 62 lymphoma patients who underwent EBP for PDPH, and after a median follow-up period of over 3 years, they reported that no patients developed CNS involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Providers should be cognizant of the infection risk associated with EBP administration, particularly in the immunocompromised host. Seeding of normal skin flora into the CSF or epidural space during catheter insertion may lead to meningitis or epidural abscess formation, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Contamination of the injection site by the normal upper airway flora of the proceduralist has also been implicated in infection following neuraxial interventions. Each of these modes of transmission can be minimized by meticulous attention to aseptic technique. Hand hygiene, use of sterile gloves and a facemask, and decontamination of the injection site with an alcohol-based antiseptic should be routine aspects of aseptic technique in neuraxial anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A further mode of transmission that deserves special consideration in this case is the direct inoculation of microorganisms contained in the blood patch where the patient has an underlying blood stream infection (BSI). On the basis of expert consensus, BSI is a relative contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A neutropenic host may not manifest with the usual signs of BSI, and in cases where a patient is febrile and has an absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/μL, the procedure should be postponed.\n\n【14】In this case report, we described a patient with a PDPH who was hospitalized for a recently discovered hematological malignancy. The patient continued to have debilitating postural headache pain eleven days after his most recent lumbar puncture, and he had failed conservative treatments. In our case, the decision to proceed with an EBP was influenced by a serendipitous finding that on the day prior, his bone marrow biopsy was bereft of blast cells while they were still detected in his CSF analysis. While these findings do not eliminate the risk of CNS seeding, they helped tilt the risk-benefit analysis in favor of proceeding with an EBP.\n\n【15】Although definitive solutions are not always present in such challenging medical situations, it is imperative for the clinician to have an open discussion with the patient on risks and benefits of EBP and to assess the degree of discomfort and burden from the PDPH. Given the lack of safety data and the considerable variability in the goals each patient may have, we advocate for a multidisciplinary discussion individually tailored to the needs of the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The exact mechanism of GH remains unknown, but fluctuations in blood glucose and insulin levels play important roles in promoting glycogen accumulation. We report a case of a 16-year-old female diagnosed with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus with hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes. The patient experienced multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis, and she also had celiac disease diagnosed 2 years previously based on serology and a duodenal biopsy. The laboratory analyses results were compatible with acute hepatitis, and the celiac serology was positive. Other investigations ruled out viral hepatitis and autoimmune and metabolic liver diseases. Ultrasound and computerized tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen revealed liver enlargement with diffuse fatty infiltration. A liver biopsy revealed the presence of abundant glycogen in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes. PAS staining was strongly positive, which confirmed the diagnosis of GH. There were no features of autoimmune hepatitis or significant fibrosis. Duodenal biopsy results were consistent with celiac disease. Despite our efforts, which are supported by a multidisciplinary team approach that included a hepatologist, a diabetic educator, a dietitian, and an endocrinologist, we have encountered difficulties in controlling the patient’s diabetes, and she persistently maintains symptomatic hepatomegaly and abnormal liver biochemistry. Given the patient’s age, we assumed that these abnormalities were related to patient noncompliance. In conclusion, GH remains an under-recognized complication of type 1 DM that is potentially reversible with adequate glycemic control. The awareness of GH should prevent diagnostic delay and its implications for management and the outcome.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Glycogen hepatopathy is characterized by glycogen deposition in hepatocytes due to both glycogen synthesis and the inhibition of glycogenolysis. This condition has been described in type 1 diabetes mellitus and occurs as a result of an imbalance in the production and degradation of glycogen following insulin introduction. This imbalance leads to the abnormal accumulation of glycogen in hepatocytes and results in hepatomegaly and the leakage of transaminases out of liver cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Although the mechanism of the development of GH is still unrecognized, it is clear that fluctuations in blood glucose and insulin levels play an important role in promoting glycogen accumulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We report a case of a 16-year-old female diagnosed with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on insulin therapy. She was referred to an adult hepatology outpatient clinic due to hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes that were discovered incidentally during a routine workup a year previously.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 16-year-old female was referred to an adult hepatology outpatient clinic due to elevated liver enzymes that were discovered incidentally during a routine workup one year previously. She had T1DM diagnosed 4 years previously and was receiving insulin therapy with an average requirement of 1.2 units/kg/day. However, her diabetes was poorly controlled (hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> 11.5%), and she had multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n【7】She was frequently nauseated and frequently complained of abdominal distension associated with mild to moderate colicky intermittent epigastric pain. There was no history of liver disease, blood transfusion, herbal ingestion, or cholelithiasis. She was not an alcohol or drug consumer and was not taking any medication other than insulin. Additionally, she did not exhibit any symptom or signs compatible with acute or chronic hepatitis. The patient had celiac disease diagnosed 2 years previously based on serology and a duodenal biopsy. She was on a strict gluten-free diet. Her elder brother had T1DM, and her younger brother had eczema. There was no family history of liver diseases or other autoimmune disorders. Her menarche occurred at 12 years of age, and her periods were irregular.\n\n【8】Physical examination revealed a body mass index of 22.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. She had a nontender distended and tense abdomen with hepatomegaly. She had no ascites or stigmata of chronic liver disease. Her pubertal development was normal. The physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【9】During her clinical follow-ups, she had several severe flares of serum transaminases that returned to normal within days without any specific treatment. Her laboratory analyses were compatible with acute hepatitis  with concomitant increases in gamma-glutamyl transferase (164 U/L, normal <55) and alkaline phosphatase (286 U/L, normal <180). Her liver function panels were all normal and included albumin (39 g/L), INR (0.81), and total bilirubin (4 µmol/L). Her lipid profile was abnormal with elevated triglycerides (5.26 mmol/L) and a cholesterol level of 7.2 mmol/L.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Liver enzymes pattern.</u>\n\n【11】A complete blood cell count, renal profile, and ferritin level were normal. The serologies for viral hepatitis A, B, C, E, HIV, EBV, and cytomegalovirus were negative. A complete workup for autoimmune and metabolic liver disease was unremarkable and included tests for serum ceruloplasmin, copper, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha-fetoprotein, and immunoglobulins. Additionally, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-nuclear smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), and liver-kidney microsomal antibody (LKM1) were all negative. The celiac serology was positive. Her thyroid function, FSH, LSH, and prolactin levels were normal. Her vitamin D level was low (58.29 nmol/l normal >145), and her vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal.\n\n【12】The ultrasound and CT scans of the abdomen revealed liver enlargement (23 cm span) with a bright, coarse echotexture. She exhibited no splenomegaly or ascites. A liver biopsy revealed the presence of abundant glycogen in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes. The PAS staining was strongly positive. Perls staining revealed no iron deposition. There were no features of autoimmune hepatitis or significant fibrosis . A duodenal biopsy revealed total villous atrophy with an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes and crypt hyperplasia consistent with celiac disease.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Liver biopsy showing presence of abundant glycogen in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and (b) a strongly positive PAS stain.</u>\n\n【14】Despite our efforts, which were supported by a multidisciplinary team approach that included a hepatologist, diabetic educator, dietitian, and endocrinologist, we have encountered difficulties in controlling the patient’s diabetes, and she is persistently symptomatic with hepatomegaly and abnormal liver biochemistry. Given the patient’s age, we initially assumed that these abnormalities were related to patient noncompliance.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】From a historical point of view, in 1930, Pierre Mauriac described Mauriac Syndrome (MS) as a rare complication of poorly controlled type I DM in children. MS is characterized by overloading of the hepatocytes with glycogen, hepatomegaly, and abnormal liver enzymes. MS is associated with growth failure, delayed puberty, and cushingoid features. These complications were first described shortly after the introduction of insulin in 1922 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Hepatic glycogen deposition was described as a feature of MS, but more recently it has been described in the absence of other MS features. Even more recently, this condition has been known as glycogenic hepatopathy (GH) and has been described in children, adolescents, and young adult with poorly controlled type I DM. MS has recently been reported in patients with type II DM who are receiving insulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The disease results from glycogen synthesis and the inhibition of glycogenolysis. In the state of hyperglycemia, glucose enters hepatocytes independent of insulin and is subsequently converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by glucokinase. This high level of G-6-P can allosterically stimulate glycogen synthesis via the activation of glycogen synthase. When insulin is administered, it has a covalent modification effect on both glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis that involves the promotion of the dephosphorylation of both the glycogen phosphatase and glycogen synthase enzymes. This effect leads to an imbalance in the production and degradation of glycogen, and the hepatocytes subsequently abnormally accumulate glycogen. Swelling of the hepatocytes leads to the leakage of liver transaminases and hepatomegaly. This condition can occur as early as two to four weeks after the initiation of insulin therapy or as a late complication of poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. However, not all diabetic patients who exhibit poor glycemic control develop GH. It has been suggested that a regulatory protein is responsible for the marked glycogen accumulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>; however, recent studies have failed to demonstrate such an effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Although the mechanism of the development of GH is still unrecognized, it is clear that fluctuations in blood glucose and insulin levels play an important role in the promotion of glycogen accumulation. This process can be controlled by either stabilizing the persistent hyperglycemia with infrequent large doses of insulin, such as those given during ketoacidosis, or alternately by the administration of glucose to patients who are receiving excessive insulin to treat the hypoglycemic episodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Several studies have demonstrated that intensive glycemic control or the normalization of glucose metabolism in post-pancreatic transplantation leads to the normalization of liver enzymes and resolves hepatomegaly. Additionally, the complete resolution of histopathological changes can occur within a relatively short period, which results in a favorable prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Hepatomegaly and elevated serum transaminase in diabetic patients are commonly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Clinically, it is important to distinguish GH from NAFLD. The characteristics of both diseases are summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4, 9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Table 1 Comparison of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and glycogenic hepatopathy.\n\n【23】In our case, prior to obtaining the liver biopsy, we thought of celiac hepatopathy as a possible explanation for her unexplained elevated liver enzymes given her positive serology and abnormal duodenal biopsy. Our case is one of the two reported cases of GH in association with celiac disease. Celiac hepatopathy clinically, radiologically, and histologically varies depending on the degree of liver injury. The characteristics of celiac hepatopathy are summarized in Table 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Table 2 Comparison of celiac hepatopathy and glycogenic hepatopathy.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】GH remains an under-recognized complication of type 1DM and is characterized by severe transaminase flares and hepatomegaly and is reversible with adequate glycemic control. Clinicians should monitor the clinical response to optimize the glycemic control. Furthermore, the awareness of GH should prevent diagnostic delay and its implications for management and outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In our patient, the abscess occurred three weeks after LSG in a 21-year-old man, and it was successfully treated conservatively.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Morbid obesity is nowadays a common disease affecting large amount of adults worldwide. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a simple procedure to treat morbid obesity. However, complications occur and include hemorrhage, leak of luminal contents, obstruction, and infection (wound and intra-abdominal abscess).

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 21-year-old obese male with a body mass index of 45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> underwent LSG in our department in April 2018. The patient did not have any past medical or surgical history. No systemic CT scan was done preoperatively, only gastroscopy that showed normal mucous of the stomach. The operation was very smooth without any complications: no splenic infarction nor a tear was detectable. No hemostatic agents were used. Immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 2 after tolerating a clear diet. No routine CT scan or opacification was made. Three weeks after surgery, the patient presented high fever and chills and took 24 hours of oral antibiotics before consulting his surgeon who decided to rehospitalize the patient.\n\n【6】At admission, his temperature was 38.5°C, and pulse rate was 120/min with a normal blood pressure. The blood results revealed 17,700 WBC and a CRP level at 295. Abdominal CT scan  showed a splenic abscess of 10 cm with no evidence of leakage. Initial management included hydration, intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam), and percutaneous drainage . The liquid culture was negative.

A new abdominal CT scan showed a residual splenic collection of 2 × 3 cm with a pleural effusion . The pleural effusion was drained, and it revealed a transudate liquid with negative culture. The splenic collection was considered as a residual abscess, and then we decided to upgrade antibiotherapy to a larger broad-spectrum one (imipenem) without radiologic or surgical drainage of the residual splenic abscess. A total of ten days with intravenous antibiotic treatment was necessary before fever disappearance. The patient was discharged under IM ertapenem for 10 days.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Pleural effusion and residual splenic abscess of 2 × 3 cm.</u>\n\n【11】Follow-up at 6 months, the patient was completely asymptomatic.

Discussion\n\n【13】In general, splenic abscess can result from multiple causes such as neoplasia, immunodeficiency, trauma, splenic infarction, endocarditis, and sickle cell disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It was also reported after some gastric procedures like Nissen fundoplication and gastrectomy for cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Splenic abscess after LSG is a very rare condition, and the literature enumerates twelve patients who experienced this condition  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>. The mechanism of formation of splenic abscess described by the previous authors include iatrogenic splenic injury during surgery, splenic ischemia after LSG, extension from a gastric staple-line leak, and temporary immune suppression in the immediate postoperative course.\n\n【15】Table 1 Characteristics of the different cases.\n\n【16】In our case, there was no evidence of leakage nor a spleen ischemia or a spleen injury during the operation. Therefore, the formation of splenic abscess could be related to temporary immune suppression that results from rapid weight loss, limited oral intake, and a transient bacteraemia as it was noticed by Sakran et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In most of the cases, the patient presented with fever, leucocytosis, and left upper quadrant pain. Our patient experienced the same symptoms.

Enteric Gram negative and Gram positive were the common organisms as presented in Table 1. In our case, the culture was negative because the patient started on antibiotics without our knowledge before being admitted.\n\n【19】Solitary spleen abscesses are actually treated with percutaneous or laparoscopic drainage, in order to preserve the spleen. When symptoms persist or when multiple abscesses exist, splenectomy remains the definitive management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11, 12\\]</u>. However, our patient experienced a good evolution and a stable condition under conservative treatment, although a residual collection was documented on the last CT scan.\n\n【20】After all, would a splenectomy be beneficial even if the patient is completely asymptomatic, knowing that he is actually 6 months off treatment postoperatively?\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】Splenic abscess is a very rare complication after LSG. The etiology of formation of splenic abscess needs further studies.

The increased absorption of the spilling conjugated bile from the gall bladder by the inflamed peritoneum causes jaundice and direct hyperbilirubinemia. A 56-year-old male patient with septic generalized peritonitis and obstructive-type hyperbilirubinemia came to our hospital. The blood examination showed that total, direct, and indirect bilirubin were 6.20, 5.38, and 0.82 mg/dl. The gall bladder perforation was not detected on USG, CT scan, and MRCP. On laparotomy, we found a 0.5 cm perforation on the fundus of the gall bladder and 2500 cc of bilious fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Cholecystectomy was performed, and the patient completely recovered after the surgery. Preoperative diagnosis of spontaneous gall bladder perforation is difficult even by using ultrasonography, CT scan, and MRCP. The inflammatory reaction of the peritoneum in bile peritonitis increases the absorption of the spilled conjugated bile from the peritoneal cavity. The obstructive-type hyperbilirubinemia without dilatation of the bile duct on imaging examination was the sign of bile leakage into the peritoneal cavity. In septic condition, the preoperative diagnosis of the spontaneous gall bladder perforation is important to establish so that the surgeon can make only a minimal procedure in reducing the morbidity.

The vital signs were the BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 110, and rectal temperature 38.6°C. The patient had jaundice, and the abdomen was distended, guarding with rebound tenderness and decreased bowel sound. The laboratory values were as follows: white blood cell count 25.020 mm<sup>3</sup>; total bilirubin 6.20 mg/dl; direct bilirubin 5.38 mg/dl; indirect bilirubin 0.82 mg/dl; AST 22 U/L; ALT 15 U/L; amylase 18 U/L; and lipase 13,28 U/L.\n\n【6】On abdominal ultrasound, the gallbladder was normal with stones inside, with the biggest size 1.29 cm without dilatation of the bile duct system . There was also nonconclusive finding on abdominal computed tomography .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Abdominal ultrasound: normal gall bladder with stones without dilatation of the bile duct.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Abdominal CT scan: nonconclusive finding.</u>\n\n【9】MRI was performed due to the jaundice and direct hyperbilirubinemia, and the result showed that there were two gallstones, without dilatation of IHBD and EHBD .

Laparotomy and cholecystectomy were performed. On the specimen examination, we found a perforated tract on the fundus of the gallbladder surrounded by the focal necrotic area . After being operated on, the patient completely recovered and allowed home 7 days after the surgery.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Gall bladder specimen: (a) perforated tract marked with a thread; (b) gall bladder section through the tract.</u>\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】The etiopathogenesis of spontaneous gall bladder perforation is still obscure; however, the most plausible mechanism is the complication from the stones and acute cholecystitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. The clinical sign presented was like acute cholangitis because the patient was having jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain with the total bilirubin 6.20 mg/dl and direct bilirubin 5.38 mg/dl. The sign of infection WBC 25.02 k/uL and CRP 235.00 mg/l was also found. However, after we found that there was no dilatation of the bile duct on MRCP, the diagnosis of acute cholangitis was excluded. Generally, the signs and symptoms of spontaneous perforation of the gallbladder show that it is difficult to distinguish them from peritonitis because of other causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–11\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Ultrasonography was not conclusive in the presumptive diagnosis of gall bladder perforation even with CT scan and MRI. The HIDA scan is more sensitive to diagnose gall bladder perforation; however, it is not suitable for patients with septic peritonitis and unstable hemodynamics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The inflammatory reaction of the peritoneum in bile peritonitis induces neoangiogenesis which increases the effective endothelial surface layer leading to relatively faster absorption of the spilled conjugated bile from the peritoneal cavity to the blood capillaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Moreover, the dilution of the previously hyperosmotic and irritative bile by the peritoneal fluid makes the osmotic conductance of the bile through the peritoneal membrane increase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Bile consists of both conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin in varying proportions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The increased absorption of the conjugated bile in the peritoneal cavity by the inflamed peritoneum in the case of bile peritonitis causes the patient to have jaundice and direct hyperbilirubinemia on blood examination.\n\n【17】In the case of bile peritonitis, indirect bilirubin is less absorbed by the peritoneum because it predominantly exists in its diacid form rather than to the smaller amounts of mono/dianion. The diacid form has low aqueous solubility and tends to aggregate on the lipid membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. On the contrary, the direct bilirubin is water-soluble 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Therefore, the direct bilirubin increased its systemic concentration greater than indirect bilirubin, mimicking obstructive-type jaundice in this patient.\n\n【18】The acidity (pKa) also affects the bioavailability of bilirubin. The direct bilirubin pKa is approximately 1.5, whereas the indirect bilirubin pKa varies widely from 4 to 9 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. At the pH of the peritoneal fluid, direct bilirubin will be ionized and more water-soluble than indirect bilirubin is, and therefore, the former is potentially absorbable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Spontaneous common bile duct perforation also shows the similar sign, that is, obstructive-type jaundice. However, jaundice should have begun long before the sign of generalized peritonitis because it must be preceded by the previous common bile duct obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In this case, jaundice presently occurred concomitant with the signs of generalized peritonitis, so we excluded the common bile duct perforation. Hyperbilirubinemia is also found in generalized peritonitis caused by perforated or gangrenous appendicitis; however, in this case, not only the direct hyperbilirubinemia but also concomitant with indirect hyperbilrubinemia may occur. The pathogenesis is thought to be because of bacteremia or endotoxemia brought through the portal vein causing an imbalance between the production and excretion of bilirubin in the liver, and it impaired the excretion of bilirubin from the bile canaliculi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. There are also the cases with other peritonitis caused by bowel perforations where the infection is also brought through the portal vein to the liver and causes both direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. However, in the case of spontaneous gall bladder perforation, only direct hyperbilirubinemia may occur, but indirect hyperbilirubinemia does not increase much because the infection of the gall bladder that causes perforation to be brought not through the portal vein. Moreover, indirect bilirubin is less absorbed by the peritoneal membrane.\n\n【20】It should be emphasized that the symptom of peritonitis concomitant with obstructive-type jaundice and no dilatation of the bile duct are the specific signs in making the diagnosis of gall bladder perforation. However, when there is a dilatation of the bile duct, then the diagnosis of acute cholangitis is suspected.\n\n【21】The preoperative diagnosis of spontaneous gall bladder perforation in the case of septic peritonitis is important to make so that the surgeon can decide not to perform more invasive surgery. In septic condition, only performing percutaneous biliary drainage is more beneficial than immediately performing laparotomy and cholecystectomy. By draining the bile from the peritoneal cavity, the condition of the patient will improve. Then, on the next step, cholecystectomy can be performed with less morbidity without performing laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【22】From the abovementioned explanation, it could be concluded that the presently occurring jaundice and obstructive-type hyperbilirubinemia without dilatation of the bile duct in the case of generalized peritonitis are specific signs of spontaneous gall bladder perforation. In septic condition, the preoperative diagnosis of spontaneous gall bladder perforation is important to establish so that the surgeon can make only a minimal procedure in reducing the morbidity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

A rare case of spontaneous rupture of SPT is reported. A 13-year-old female felt acute abdominal pain without blunt abdominal trauma. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor in the pancreas tail with fluid collection around it. The tumor was diagnosed as SPT with hemoperitoneum associated with spontaneous rupture. The bleeding was stopped conservatively and she was referred for surgery at three months after the rupture. At that time, CT revealed a tumor 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreas tail without distant metastases. Since peritoneal dissemination was not seen on intraoperative exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT with rupture of the capsule of tumor, and complete resection was confirmed. The patient has been followed up for two years, and she is alive without recurrence.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas was first described by Frantz in 1959 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. SPT is regarded as an uncommon low grade malignant tumor accounting for 1-2% of exocrine pancreatic tumors, usually affecting young females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>. The clinical presentations of SPT have been various and not specific. SPT was discovered by rupture and hemoperitoneum which was considered to be rare. In the literature, most of the ruptures of SPT were associated with the blunt abdominal trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>, while the spontaneous rupture seemed to be quite uncommon. We report a rare case of a spontaneous ruptured SPT which was resected completely by elective laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain. She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it . The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor. Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously. The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender. Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor. At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable. The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared . From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed. Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears . Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss. Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4. Except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT of the pancreas. The negative surgical margin and the rupture of the capsule of tumor were verified by microscopic examination . She survived without recurrence of disease for two years after the operation.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Urgent CT of acute abdomen.

Discussion\n\n【11】It is well known that SPT usually shows no characteristic clinical presentation, and the main nonspecific symptoms are abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4, 9–12\\]</u>. In the present case, tumor was discovered by acute abdominal pain due to rupture of the tumor and hemoperitoneum. The incidence of the rupture of SPT was reported in 2.7% of 292 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Regarding rupture of SPT, blunt abdominal trauma was the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u> and according to a review article, 3% of 718 cases of SPT were discovered after the trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Other cases were considered to be spontaneous rupture and it was estimated to occur in approximately 1% of all SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Since the cystic part of SPT consisted of the degeneration after the intramural hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9, 13, 16\\]</u>, SPT had a natural tendency to hemorrhage inside the tumor. Therefore, the spontaneous rupture of SPT was considered to result from both abrupt massive hemorrhage and increase of the pressure in the tumor. Panieri and colleagues reported a case of the major bleed into the lesser sac causing the rupture of SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, and the enhanced CT also revealed a massive bleeding around the pancreatic tumor when our patient felt acute abdominal pain. Moreover, the tumor of the present case seemed to be slightly larger at the moment of rupture than three months later. When the abrupt hemorrhage occurred in the abdomen, emergency laparotomy was usually indicated. However, in the present case, the hemorrhage stopped with conservative therapy and allowed elective surgical treatment.\n\n【13】Surgical resection is the only treatment to cure SPT generally assuring a good prognosis, as reflected in the overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 95% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 12\\]</u>. Most cases of SPT have previously undergone the standard pancreatic resections such as pancreatoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy, because the tumors were relatively large and misdiagnosed as malignant disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11\\]</u>. However, the surgical procedure indicated for SPT still remains controversial. Namely, taking into account the character of SPT, if at all possible the surgical procedures preserving pancreatic parenchyma and function should be selected. Butte and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> described microscopic margins that were not considered a strong prognostic factor for the disease recurrence in SPT. Therefore, either partial resection or enucleation might be indicated for the small SPT, especially those localized in the periphery of the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 11, 17, 18\\]</u>. Actually, local resections and enucleations were performed in approximately 30% of SPT according to the recent literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 19, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【14】On the other hand, there was a report that enucleation for the pancreatic tumor had a high risk of pancreatic fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Although postoperative pancreatic fistula was reported in 38% of sixty-one enucleation cases of the pancreatic tumor, it was considered a safe and effective procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 21\\]</u>. Li and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> recommended a minimized resection such as enucleation and partial resection for SPT, because there were no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative complications and the prognosis between the minimized resection and the standard resection.\n\n【15】In pancreatic surgery, the laparoscopic technique has been increasingly applied in recent years, but it still remains uncommon. Both enucleation and distal pancreatectomy were procedures without reconstruction. Therefore, they were the first to be performed by the laparoscopic approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>. These laparoscopic procedures of enucleation and distal pancreatectomy have already been considered to be feasible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–22\\]</u> and have shown good indications for the low-grade malignant SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 21, 22\\]</u>. It was mentioned that there were no statistically significant differences in the postoperative complications and the prognosis between laparoscopic surgery and ordinary surgery for SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. With regard to SPT, parenchyma preserving surgical procedure with laparoscopy should be considered if the tumor is small in size and located away from the main pancreatic duct.\n\n【16】There might be another argument in the surgical approach for ruptured SPT. Namely, when the emergency operation was decided just after the rupture of SPT, open surgery might usually be selected. Since acute hemorrhage due to the rupture of SPT was stopped by conservative therapy in the present case, we considered elective laparoscopic surgery. But if the peritoneal dissemination was seen on intraoperative laparoscopic exploration, the conversion to open surgery was considered necessary for curable resection of a metastatic lesion with primary tumor.\n\n【17】Recurrence was reported to occur in 10% to 15% of SPT patients after surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 10, 12\\]</u>. Kim and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> asserted that the tumor rupture might be the risk factor for recurrence after surgery for SPT. The previous reports showed that peritoneal dissemination of SPT occurred in only few cases even after the rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 14, 23, 24\\]</u>, although rupture of SPT was expected to be the most predictable factor for the peritoneal dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 25\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Actually, some case reports indicated that disease free periods of the ruptured cases ranged from 12 to 66 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 15, 25, 26\\]</u>. On the other hand, Kyokane et al. reported that the dissemination associated with the rupture of SPT was seen in only one case among the six cases of SPT with peritoneal dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Since the rupture of SPT has been quite uncommon, the relationship between rupture of SPT and peritoneal dissemination remains to be resolved.\n\n【19】In conclusion, a quite uncommon case of spontaneous rupture of the solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas has been described. Although emergency laparotomy is usually performed in the case with hemoperitoneum associated with rupture of the pancreatic tumor, we were able to resect SPT completely by elective laparoscopic surgery. SPT is considered to be a low-grade malignancy and a good prognosis is expected after the surgery. However, our patient who is alive without recurrence after surgery for two years should continue to be followed up carefully.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We herein present a case of a large subcapsular splenic hematoma with a large pancreatic pseudocyst successfully treated with splenic arterial embolization and US-guided percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst, for the first time.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 44-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of recurrent abdominal pain for more than two years that worsened over the past two weeks. He was a heavy drinker, with alcohol consumption of 250 g/day for 15 years. He had no history of trauma but previous 3 episodes of pancreatitis. He had the first episode of acute pancreatitis two years ago and received conservative treatment for it. The second episode of acute pancreatitis, about one and a half years ago, was accompanied by retroperitoneal cyst and splenomegaly along with dilation of the pancreatic duct. During the second episode, he underwent pancreatic duct dilation with a stent implanted into the pancreatic duct that was removed after 4 months. During the third episode of acute pancreatitis, about six months ago, a large pseudocyst was seen in the body and tail of the pancreas. Patient’s symptoms were relieved after symptomatic treatment, but pseudocyst had not been treated. Nearly two weeks ago, the patient had recurrent upper abdominal pain, which was persistent and radiating to the left shoulder and back. He was admitted to local hospital. The routine blood test showed hemoglobin 102 g/L and serum amylase 139 U/L. Abdominal CT showed a large pseudocyst in the body and tail of the pancreas with signs of bleeding, a large subcapsular hematoma of the spleen, and cholecystitis with gallstones. Despite the conservative treatment consisting of pain control, bowel rest, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics, the pain was not relieved, so he visited our hospital.\n\n【6】After admission, his blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature were 117/69 mmHg, 58 beats per minute, and 36.5°C, respectively. The abdominal examination revealed a palpable mass in the left upper quadrant with mild tenderness. The spleen was palpable under the left costal arch. Murphy’s sign was negative. The laboratory findings showed that the liver function tests, renal function tests, and electrolytes were within normal limit. However, there was a leukocytosis (12500/mm<sup>3</sup>), increased C-reactive protein (10.1 mg/dL), and decreased hemoglobin (9.1 g/dL) and hematocrit (26.9%). The serum amylase was 117 U/L, which were slightly above the normal range. The endoscopic ultrasonography revealed gastric vein varicosis in the fundus, pancreatic pseudocyst, cholecystitis with accumulation of biliary sludge, splenomegaly with subcapsular hematoma, and splenic vein varicosis. The CT-Abdomen revealed a huge low-density mass (16.0 × 16.0 × 7.6 cm) with some separations and loss of normal pancreatic morphology in the body and tail, splenomegaly with subcapsular hematoma (13.5 × 10.0 × 8.0 cm) that possibly pressurizes the left kidney, multiple cysts seen in the liver, gallstones, abdominal and pelvic effusion, bilateral pleural effusion with lungs atelectasis, splenic vein dilation, and expansion of portal vein branches .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT scan showing a large subcapsular splenic hematoma (16.0 × 16.0 × 7.6 cm) with a large pancreatic pseudocyst (13.5 × 10.0 × 8.0 cm).</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CT scan showing a large subcapsular splenic hematoma with a large pancreatic pseudocyst.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Vascular restructure with CT showing splenic vein dilation and expansion of portal vein branches.</u>\n\n【10】During hospitalization, EUS-guided pseudocyst puncture and drainage were done, where small amount of dark brown liquid was collected.

Splenic artery embolization  was done on the next day, with no significant changes on the follow-up CT-Abdomen result. About 4 days later, ultrasound-guided percutaneous puncture drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst was done . Postoperative fluid collection was about 5000 ml of dark brown liquid with amylase 21577 U/L, lipase 56704 U/L, red blood cell count 0.45 × 10<sup>12</sup>/L, and hemoglobin 29 g/L. The follow-up CT-Abdomen (plain + contrast), about 2 weeks later, showed the disappearance of pancreatic pseudocyst and multiple areas of infarction on the spleen, while the splenic subcapsular hematoma had significantly reduced . Abdominal ultrasound was done to obtain detailed status of the subcapsular hematoma. During hospitalization, the patient was also supplemented by antibiotics, nutritional support, acid suppression, and inhibition of pancreatic secretion. The patient was discharged after almost a month of his hospital admission with the drainage tube attached, and about 2 weeks later the drainage tube was removed upon CT scan confirmation of decrease in the volume of the subcapsular hematoma .

Discussion\n\n【17】In the present case, a large subcapsular splenic hematoma complicating large pancreatic pseudocyst gradually disappears after splenic arterial embolization and US-guided percutaneous drainage of a large pancreatic pseudocyst, and drainage of a subcapsular splenic hematoma and surgical procedures such as a splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy were avoided.\n\n【18】Splenic hematoma is a rare complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis when compared with traumatic origin of subcapsular hematoma. The tail of the pancreas is in close proximity to the splenic hilum, whereas the peritoneum encases the anterior pancreatic surface along with the splenic vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. This anatomy provides a potential for splenic involvement in pancreatitis. There are several possible theories which might explain the mechanisms that how pancreatitis leads to subcapsular splenic hematoma: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> erosion of splenic parenchyma after pancreatic enzyme leakage, resulting in either a splenic hematoma or intrasplenic bleeding, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> disruption of splenic hilar vessels leading to subcapsular splenic hematoma, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> expansion of intrasplenic pseudocysts resulting in splenic rupture and bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In our case report, patient has a history of three episodes of pancreatitis. During the third episode, the CT scan showed pseudocysts with variable sizes at the body and tail of the pancreas, which were compressing the splenic vein and parenchyma. Therefore, according to the results of CT scan and enhancement imaging, we assume that direct erosion into the splenic parenchyma or disruption of the splenic vein might have led to a subcapsular splenic hematoma in this case.\n\n【19】Because splenic involvement in patients with pancreatitis is uncommon, the diagnosis of subcapsular hematoma of the spleen needs the alertness of physicians and imaging studies. Patients with pancreatitis exhibiting a mass in the left upper quadrant, pain radiating to the left shoulder, elevation of the left diaphragm, and a moderate fall in hematocrit should be suspected to have splenic complications. Imaging studies that are used to monitor the pancreatitis, such as CT and MRI, are regarded as reliable diagnostic tools and should be performed early in questionable patients. A splenic hematoma can be distinguished from simple fluid collection based on density (Hounsfield units > 30). Angiography is not essential for the diagnosis but would be indicated if splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, splenic vein thrombosis, or active bleeding was suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The management of subcapsular splenic hematoma in pancreatitis remains controversial, maybe due to its rareness. Some reports have advocated aggressive management with early splenectomy to avoid splenic rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 10\\]</u>. Thompson Jr. and Ashley 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> described 3 cases with acute pancreatitis accompanied by large subcapsular hematoma of the spleen. Two patients recovered after splenectomy, but 1 patient died due to continuing blood loss. They suggested that the treatment of subcapsular splenic hematoma should be a splenectomy in the vast majority of patients to prevent continuing blood loss and potential rupture. However, some authors advocate a conservative approach, which is based on the experience with traumatic lesions that can resolve spontaneously. Patel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a case of subcapsular splenic hematoma managed conservatively with a favorable outcome, in which the CT scan showed the marked resolution of the hematoma after 4 months. This approach was considered as a safe management in hemodynamically stable patients. As a part of conservative approaches, percutaneous drainage of the hematoma, which showed good prognosis, may be increasingly used in recent years. Four cases of a subcapsular splenic hematoma have been reported which were successfully treated by percutaneous drainage of the hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>. Prompt relief of symptoms, a short recovery time, avoidance of rupture, and spleen preservation are the benefits of percutaneous drainage. In addition, Purushothaman and Borowski 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> also demonstrated the satisfying effect of splenic artery embolization for subcapsular splenic hematoma. However, it was just one particular case, which was reported.\n\n【21】In this special case, the patient suffered from a large subcapsular splenic hematoma with a large pancreatic pseudocyst. After repeatedly discussing about patient history and imaging studies in the multidisciplinary team (MDT), we considered that the only drainage of large pancreatic pseudocyst or spleen subcapsular hematoma will destroy the balance of the existing abdominal pressure, which may worsen subcapsular splenic hematoma, and the rupture of splenic hematoma and other unpredictable life-threatening consequences might even occur. Therefore, we made splenic artery embolization to decrease the blood supply of the spleen. Following, we made the US-guided percutaneous drainage of the large pancreatic pseudocysts. The postoperative abdomen CT scan demonstrated the significant resolution of pancreatic pseudocyst and subcapsular splenic hematoma, with relief of symptoms. There are several possibilities which might explain that subcapsular splenic hematoma gradually disappeared after splenic artery embolization and percutaneous drainage of the large pancreatic pseudocysts: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> splenic artery embolism reduces the blood supply of spleen, and spleen subcapsular bleeding stopped; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> after adequate percutaneous drainage of the large pancreatic pseudocyst, the pressure of splenic hilum decreased and the return of splenic vein increased which accelerated the absorption of hematoma; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> there was the common channel between subcapsular splenic hematoma and pancreatic pseudocyst, so subcapsular splenic hematoma was also being drained while draining the pancreatic pseudocyst.\n\n【22】In conclusion, the definitive management of a subcapsular splenic hematoma complicating pancreatic pseudocyst is not yet established. Surgical intervention may be one of the therapeutic options for hemodynamically unstable patients, but with high mortality rate. Imaging-guided percutaneous drainage and splenic artery embolization appeared to be another feasible option for subcapsular splenic hematomas to prevent splenic rupture and obviate splenectomy. For the case of subcapsular splenic hematoma with a large pancreatic pseudocyst, the splenic artery embolization and US-guided percutaneous drainage of large pancreatic pseudocyst may be a safe and effective management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Spindle cell (sarcomatoid) carcinoma of the larynx is a rare tumor and comprises 2% to 3% of all laryngeal cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most malignant carcinoma of the larynx, and spindle cell (sarcomatoid) tumor is considered a highly malignant variant of squamous cell carcinoma. Spindle cell carcinoma is considered to be a biphasic tumor that is composed of a squamous cell carcinoma (in situ or invasive) and spindle cell carcinoma with sarcomatous appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Since a majority of these tumors are polypoid or pedunculated and tend to cause obstructive symptoms, these tumors are often detected at an early stage, removed by polypectomy during diagnosis, and tend to have a very good prognosis. The following is a case report of one such patient who presented to our institution with spindle cell (sarcomatoid) carcinoma of the larynx.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 67-year-old Caucasian male presented to the internal medicine clinic with 2-month history of progressive hoarseness that has been affecting his ability to speak and dysphagia. The patient also described a 20-pound weight loss over the last several months due to his dysphagia and odynophagia. The patient history was significant for 60 packs years of smoking.\n\n【6】In the clinic, the patient had difficulty in speaking and hoarseness of in voice. Physical examination of the patient showed a very small palpable lymphadenopathy in the anterior cervical region more pronounced on the right compared to the left. The patient did not have any supraclavicular lymph nodes bilaterally.\n\n【7】A CT scan of his neck with contrast revealed a 7 mm polypoid mass involving the anterior commissure of the vocal cords; however the nasopharynx, pharynx, peripharyngeal spaces and epiglottis appeared unremarkable. The parotid gland and submandibular salivary glands were normal; however the CT showed that the thyroid gland was enlarged. There was no adenopathy noted however .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | CT of the neck with contrast: There is 7 mm polypoid mass involving the anterior commissure of the vocal cords.

There is no significant neck adenopathy noted. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】The patient underwent a flexible laryngoscopy that showed the presence of an anterior commissure mass. The patient then underwent direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, rigid bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy which showed a pedunculated mass located in the anterior commissure with extension of the pedunculated portion into the glottic and subglottic regions. The lesion of the pedunculated mass was biopsied for pathology.\n\n【10】The pathology report showed a spindle cell (sarcomatoid) carcinoma  that strongly stained for EMA, CK 5/6 and AE 1/3, and a high MIB-1 but negative for myoD1, SMA, desmin, and myf4 .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Histological findings: loose myxomatous fibrous connective tissue containing both spindle-shaped cells as well as ovoid cells with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei with eosinophilic cytoplasm.

There was also an increase in FDG avidity with SUV 6 in the right paratracheal region of concern for a second primary malignancy. However a CT scan of his chest did not show any mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy.\n\n【14】The patient spindle cell (sarcomatoid) carcinoma was staged T1 because the tumor was pedunculated and attached only at the anterior commissure even though it prolapsed into the glottic and subglottic region of the vocal cord.\n\n【15】The patient was evaluated by head and neck surgery, and his tumor was found to be amenable to surgical excision and adjuvant radiation therapy. The patient underwent direct laryngoscopy with excision of the malignant mass and received radiation therapy. The patient’s symptoms gradually improved, and he regained good control of his voice.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is considered to be the most common type of malignant laryngeal tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Spindle cell carcinoma (SpCC) or sarcomatoid carcinoma is a highly malignant variant of squamous cell carcinoma. It is a rare tumor with a reported incidence of 2% to 3% of all laryngeal cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Spindle cell carcinoma is considered to be a biphasic tumor that is composed of a squamous cell carcinoma (in situ or invasive) and spindle cell carcinoma with sarcomatous appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. SpCC is also considered to be a monoclonal epithelial neoplasm with the sarcomatous component derived from squamous epithelium with divergent mesenchymal differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Although the exact cause of SpCC is not known, it is strongly associated with a history of cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse. It has also been suggested that SpCC is associated with radiation exposure although the determination of radiation risk may be complicated by the dose and duration of radiation exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. SpCC is more predominant in men compared to females (12 : 1 ratio) although it is becoming more common in females, and it is usually seen in the 6th and 7th decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Spindle cell carcinoma most commonly affects the glottis in the majority of cases (70%), and the majority of patients present with symptoms of hoarseness, dyspnea, cough, and dysphagia often of less than 1-year duration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The majority of these tumors are characterized as being polypoid or pedunculated (98.9%) tumors that are often less than 2 cm in size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The diagnosis of spindle cell carcinoma requires histological demonstration of both the squamous cell component and the spindle shape cells with sarcomatous appearances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Histological examination can often show the presence of squamous cell carcinoma at the surface or deeper within the tumor although this is rare especially with tumors where the surface is ulcerated or denuded. What is often seen is a blending of squamous cells and spindle cells which can be differentiated by their different arrangement which includes storiform, solid, and fascicular appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In about half of cases there is also a desmoplastic stromal fibrosis, and because the epithelial cells are capable of transforming into sarcomatoid spindle cells, it is not uncommon to see the presence of bone and cartilage and or osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma on histology.\n\n【19】In addition to histological studies, immunohistochemical studies of epithelial and mesenchymal markers are used to diagnose the tumor. Epithelial markers include keratin (AE1/AE3, CK1, 8, 9), epithelial membrane antigens, KI, and K18. Mesenchymal markers include vimentin, desmin, S-100, Osteopontin, and BMP 通用删除7(英):<u>(2, 4)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. For spindle cell carcinomas with poorly differentiated epithelial tumor components Lewis et al. have shown that p53, a transcription factor that is important for epithelial proliferation and differentiation, isparticularly useful for diagnosing SpCC of the head and neck region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Spindle cell carcinomas are staged according to the TNM classification scheme of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging. Tumors are staged according to their size and the presence or absence of metastasis to local lymph nodes or other parts of the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The treatment of spindle cell carcinoma is most influenced by the tumor location and the stage of the tumor including tumor metastasis. Other factors that are important include laryngeal preservation, good voice control posttreatment, and a lower risk of treatment complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Tumor size, locations (supraglottic, glottis, or subglottic), vocal cord mobility, and tumor stage can all impact the treatment and outcomes of patients. The majority of spindle cell tumors are detected early in stages T1 and T2 due to their obstruction of the larynx causing symptoms and are correlated with a better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Since most spindle cell tumors are polypoid and pedunculated, polypectomy and wide local excision during diagnosis can completely eliminate the entire tumor mass because of their noninvasion of the underlying stroma at that early stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Tumors that are stage T2 or less can be managed conservatively with limited field irradiation and conservative treatment to preserve the patient’s voice. Tumors that are stage 3-4 can be treated with local resection, partial laryngectomy, total laryngectomy with or without lymph node dissection followed by combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Spindle cell carcinoma of the larynx has a very good 5-year prognosis of 65%–95% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Poor prognostic factors include tumors diagnosed at higher stages, large tumors ( 3 cm) with a predominance of epithelial component, nonglottic tumors, fixed vocal cords, history of radiotherapy and metastasis to regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】Spindle cell carcinoma (SpCC) or sarcomatoid carcinoma of the larynx is a highly malignant variant of squamous cell carcinoma that is very uncommon. Because most spindle cell tumors are polypoid and pedunculated and tend to cause obstructive symptoms such as hoarseness, dyspnea, and dysphagia, most tumors without metastasis are detected early and tend to have a very good 5-year prognosis.\n\n【23】This patient’s spindle cell (sarcomatoid) carcinoma was staged T1NO without any evidence of metastasis. Due to the early detection of the tumor, the patient underwent surgical excision and adjuvant radiation therapy. His symptoms subsequently improved, and he regained good control of his voice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

A 76-year-old female suffered from a transverse type myelopathy was successfully treated by posterior decompression.

Coalition of the atlantooccipital joints and osteoarthritis of the atlantoaxial joints with degenerated dens was also revealed. Magnetic resonance imaging showed compressed spinal cord at C1 level by the ossification of TLA and AAS. We suggest a mechanism of ossification of TLA as follows: hypertrophied dens and stress to the atlantoaxial joints caused by coalition of atlantooccipital joints could make forward shift of atlas leading to irreducible AAS, and continuous tension given to TLA from irreducible AAS would result in hypertrophied and ossification of TLA.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】A pseudotumor behind dens is known to be a factor associated with cervical myelopathy at the atlantoaxial region.

All of the laboratory findings were within normal limits.\n\n【8】##### 2.2. Radiological Findings\n\n【9】Dynamic lateral plain radiographs of cervical spine revealed irreducible atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) . A sagittal reconstructed computed tomogram (CT) revealed the ossified mass behind dens and osteophyte continuing to dens. Dens and anterior arch of atlas were sclerotic, and dens itself was hypertrophied. There was no ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. CT also revealed ossified mass compatible to ossification of TLA. A space between dens and posterior arch decreased 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Dens and lateral masses of atlas were sclerotic and space around dens decreased in a coronal reconstructed CT. Coalition of bilateral atlantooccipital joints was seen 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. A sagittal planes of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed compressed spinal cord with high intensities within the spinal cord by the mass behind dens. The mass showed high intensities on T2-weighted images. The spinal cord was compressed between the mass and posterior arch of atlas, and there was no subarachnoid space around the spinal cord. The spinal cord was also compressed at the level of C3-4 and C4-5 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>.

Characteristic features of patients with ossification of TLA were elderly population, AAS, and hypertrophied dens. AAS were recognized in three cases, and hypertrophied dens were recognized in two cases. Hayashi and colleagues described that a trauma of 12 years ago led to ossification of TLA, but they did not describe a mechanism of this ossification in detail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The mechanism of this ossification is still unclear from the previous literatures.\n\n【21】Irreducible AAS and osteoarthritis at atlantoaxial joints with hypertrophied dens were seen in the current case similar to the previously reported cases. A coalition of atlantooccipital joints was also recognized only in the current case. Remnants of the atlantooccipital joints were seen in a coronal reconstructed CT, and so we diagnosed not as an assimilation of atlas but as a coalition caused by degeneration. According to Detlef and Walter, an assimilation of the atlas caused AAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Greenberg, Hagiwara, and colleagues suggested a mechanism that atlantoaxial joint compensated the function of stabilized atlantooccipital joint and a greater stress on TLA results in stretching and leading to AAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Coalition of atlantooccipital joints is different from an assimilation of atlas, but it may cause AAS as the adjacent segment degeneration by similar mechanism. On the basis of these findings, we suggested mechanism of ossification of TLA as follows: hypertrophied dens and coalition of atlantooccipital joints make forward shift of the atlas leading to irreducible AAS. Continuous stress given to TLA by irreducible AAS would result in hypertrophied and ossification of TLA leading to spinal cord compression.\n\n【22】The posterior decompression was performed for current case, because there was no instability at occipito-atlantoaxial complex.

{"seq_id": "e3dcf8e9-97e1-4054-847f-dd4b3930c7e4", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Small bowel obstructions (SBO) are a commonly encountered diagnosis within emergency departments. Typically, these patients have evident risk factors including, but not limited to, prior abdominal surgery, personal or family history of gastrointestinal disorders, femoral and inguinal hernias, or neoplasm. In this case, we describe an SBO in a female, professional athlete whose swift, severe symptom onset, rapid resolution with conservative treatment, lack of identifiable risk factors, and prompt return to high level competition without recurrence are certainly unique. A female professional basketball player in her mid-20’s with no past medical history presented with a seven-hour history of worsening abdominal pain beginning in the epigastric region and migrating to the right lower quadrant. Physical exam did not reveal abdominal distension, tympany to percussion, or high-pitched bowel sounds. Initial differential diagnosis included appendicitis, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and other genitourinary pathology. Computed tomography with contrast revealed distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, and decompressed loops of bowel distally, consistent with an SBO. Symptoms resolved after 24 hours with conservative treatment, including decompression with a nasogastric tube. The athlete returned to full participation five days after initial presentation without recurrence of symptoms. Outpatient gastroenterology workup was negative for predisposing conditions. This presentation is rare in the absence of bowel pathology, family history, or prior abdominal surgery. Perhaps, her profession as an athlete, with frequent air travel and extensive exercise, may have contributed to this unique presentation. This case report should serve as a reminder to all providers that SBOs can occur in young, active patients devoid of risk factors. Even in the absence of typical signs on physical examination, providers should use imaging as adjuncts based on their clinical gestalt and utilize conservative management, when appropriate, to maximize chances of recovery with minimal morbidity.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Small bowel obstructions (SBO) occur when a functional or mechanical blockade impairs the transit of chyme, and later air, through the intestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. There are many known risk factors that contribute to the development of an SBO, which include, but are not limited to, prior abdominal surgery, personal or family history of inflammatory bowel disease, personal history of neoplasm, femoral and inguinal hernias, or gastrointestinal motility disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In the absence of these risk factors, idiopathic SBOs rarely occur in the young, athletic population, possibly because of regular exercise habits. Moderate exercise has been proven to accelerate transit of chyme, feces, and gas within the intestines, thereby reducing the likelihood of SBO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. This case is unique in that the patient’s presentation was more typical of appendicitis or a gynecologic pathology; thus, SBO was not suspected until computed tomography (CT) revealed a transition point and bowel wall edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Given that this diagnosis is so uncommon in this population, there is a paucity of data stating when it is safe to return to athletic competition after SBO. Therefore, the medical team used the athlete’s symptoms as the guide in return to play decisions, and she was able to return to full participation five days after presentation without recurrence of symptoms.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A female professional basketball player in her mid-20’s presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a seven-hour history of worsening, sharp abdominal pain. Her pain, reported 7 out of 10 on the numeric rating scale (NRS) and exacerbated by movement with no alleviating factors, began in the epigastric region and migrated to the right lower quadrant. The patient experienced worsening nausea and emesis in the ED, warranting administration of 4 milligrams (mg) of intravenous (IV) ondansetron (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) and infusion of a one liter (L) lactated ringer bolus. Review of systems was negative for diarrhea, constipation, fever, chills, dysuria, or vaginal discharge. The patient had only consumed self-prepared food for the past day and had no recent changes to her diet, sick contacts, or recent illnesses. She had never experienced pain like this previously. Her housemates and close contacts had no similar symptoms. The patient reported a low likelihood of pregnancy, and her last menstrual period was within the last month. She also reported no personal or family history of gastrointestinal disorders, prior pregnancies, or abdominal surgery. At the time of presentation, she denied any prior or current use of medications, alcohol, tobacco, or recreational drugs.\n\n【6】The patient’s initial vital signs were a temperature of 36.8 degree Celsius (°C), blood pressure of 131/65 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), heart rate of 60 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate of 16 per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. She was in apparent discomfort, clutching her abdomen. Her physical exam revealed a nondistended abdomen with normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Tenderness to light and deep palpation in the right lower quadrant was apparent, but there was no guarding, rebound, or tympany to percussion on initial examination.\n\n【7】Initial workup included a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), and lipase, which were all within normal limits. A serum pregnancy test was negative. Urinalysis (UA) was only significant for trace ketones. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast revealed distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, and decompressed loops of bowel distally. Fecalization of the small bowel was also apparent . The preliminary diagnosis was an acute SBO. Within the ED, conservative treatment was initiated including administration of cefazolin (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) 1 gram (g) IV every 8 hours, maintenance of IV fluids at a rate of 125 milliliters per hour (mL/hr), placement of a nasogastric tube, and initiation of nil per os (NPO). The patient was admitted to the general surgery service. The timeline of events is illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showing distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, decompressed loops of bowel distally, and fecalization of small bowel.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Timeline of symptom onset through hospital discharge.

Additionally, they wanted to assess the severity of the SBO; thus, a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound (US) and a small bowel follow-through (SBFT) were ordered, respectively. The US was only significant for trace free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas, and the SBFT showed resolution of the SBO at 12 hours after admission . At this point, a clear liquid diet was added, and gastroenterology (GI) was consulted to rule out inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as the cause of the acute SBO which resolved rapidly. The GI consultants progressed the patient to a soft diet since she had a nonbloody, well-formed bowel movement and ordered a serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), both of which were within normal limits. Thus, it was decided to follow up with GI as an outpatient for further workup. At the time of discharge, the patient was pain free, tolerating regular diet, and passing stool and flatus. At four days after presentation, the athlete’s team physician allowed her to resume light jogging and shooting, followed by a full practice with her teammates later in the day. That same day, she flew with her teammates to the city of their next game. At five days after presentation, the athlete competed in a game and remained symptom-free. The patient was seen by GI seven days after presentation at which point magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) was ordered . The MRE showed no dilation, thickening, or enhancement of the bowel. These findings, coupled with her prior normal CRP and ESR, resulted in low suspicion for an underlying diagnosis of IBD, which would have been a potential predisposing condition for SBO. No other risk factors for SBO were ever identified so the patient’s etiology remains idiopathic.

Discussion\n\n【14】Annually, there are 579–654 SBOs per 100,000 people, leading to over 300,000 surgeries in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, it is atypical for a young, healthy, elite female athlete without a history of abdominal surgery or IBD to present with an SBO. In this population, abdominal pain is more frequently attributed to appendicitis, ovarian torsion, acute gastroenteritis, or IBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In the “virgin abdomen, ” defined as having no prior abdominal surgery, Beardsley et al. found adhesions to be the primary cause of SBO when diagnosed by CT and confirmed with laparoscopy; however, in this cohort, CT was only 52.9% accurate, and patients were subjected to unnecessary laparoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Furthermore, Colon et al. reported that presence of a transition zone on CT does not correlate with the need for surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Therefore, the literature supports the decision to care for this patient nonoperatively given her stable appearance, reassuring vital signs, inherent risks of surgical intervention, and high likelihood of the SBO resolving with conservative therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite the inherent limitations of imaging, CT remains the gold standard for workup of presumed SBO since definitive diagnosis with direct visualization via laparoscopy confers the common surgical risks of bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Because this patient lacked the classical findings of abdominal distension, tympany to percussion, and high-pitched bowel sounds, the diagnosis could have been missed if diagnostic imaging had not been pursued 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Despite previous reports that 13% of SBOs do not have identifiable etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, it is important to be aware of unusual causes of SBO which may not be considered in the initial differential diagnosis and may require specific work up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Bezoars, or concretions, are undigested material within the alimentary tract which can cause an SBO resulting in nonspecific symptoms similar to those appreciated in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. There are multiple types of bezoars, including: food bolus bezoars, phytobezoars, and trichobezoars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Food bolus bezoars can stem from simple origins such as incomplete mastication, rapid deglutition, and consuming large nuts or pits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Perhaps, an athlete in a rush may eat quickly and inadvertently increase the risk of a food bolus bezoar. Phytobezoars are primarily composed of undigestible plant fibers and seeds, and as such, a vegetarian diet may increase the patient's risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Trichobezoars are composed of undigested hair and are most frequently associated with trichotillomania with trichophagia. Trichobezoars can be seen in this patient’s age group and should be considered as a possible etiology of SBO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. An extremely thorough clinician would be required to unmask these potential SBO etiologies via in-depth history and exam to uncover eating habits and areas of alopecia; however, in the ED setting, these questions are unlikely to arise. Furthermore, in a retrospective case series, CT scan was only 47% effective in identifying bezoars, so imaging alone cannot be depended upon to reach the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Thus, a high index of suspicion, coupled with history, physical, and diagnostic testing, is necessary to tailor treatment given that few bezoars will pass spontaneously and instead require endoscopic or open surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 18\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Intense physical activity can be another uncommon etiology of SBO. As aforementioned, studies suggest an inverse relationship exists between exercise and gastrointestinal disease with mild to moderate activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Despite this suggestion, de Oliveira and Burini caution that strenuous exercise coupled with dehydration exacerbates the risk of gastrointestinal symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Additionally, van Nieuwenhoven et al. hypothesized that running decreases small bowel transit time and blood flow, thereby increasing SBO risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Therefore, exercise serves both as a preventive measure for long-term GI disease, but in strenuous conditions, may potentiate acute illness.\n\n【18】The list of uncommon etiologies continues with researchers such as Massalou et al. suggesting that even recent air travel may contribute to SBO due to the threat barometric changes pose to hollow viscera. This likens the risk of SBO to the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pneumothorax associated with flight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Although many of the aforementioned etiologies are speculative, careful consideration and awareness of the possibilities helps physicians to make sound medical decisions and tailor the treatment plan to the patient’s unique presentation and risk factors.\n\n【19】Though definitive diagnosis of an SBO necessitates direct visualization via laparoscopy, history, physical examination, and CT were sufficient to suggest the diagnosis of an SBO in this case. Conservative management was successful, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgical risks. Furthermore, the patient was able to return to play more quickly because there was no surgical intervention. Given her comprehensive outpatient workup which failed to reveal any predisposing factors for her SBO, the exact etiology of the SBO remains unknown. This case highlights the importance of clinical acumen and utilization of adjunctive tests, specifically imaging, to render diagnoses and provide treatment suited to the patient’s lifestyle. It also illustrates diagnostic challenges that may come from intrinsic difficulties of patient history taking. In order to identify a rare etiology for an SBO, a physician must be aware of the numerous possibilities and explore them thoroughly with the patient. Furthermore, this patient’s case is unique in that she experienced full resolution of the SBO within twelve hours and returned to elite competition five days after initial presentation, despite the absence of clear recommendations within the literature regarding the timing of safe to return to play after an acute SBO.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The imaging studies revealed a huge renal vein aneurysm. The patient refused any interventional management, despite the risk of possible rupture, and after a week of mild pain therapy, she was discharged. She was followed up closely, and after one year, she remains asymptomatic. Conservative management of such patients has been described before with success. However, open repair or percutaneous thrombosis of the aneurysm remains the indicated therapy, when vein patency is an issue for organ viability.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The most common location for visceral venous aneurysms remains the portal system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Venous aneurysms of the portal system are often associated with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. However, renal veins consist of an unusual location for visceral venous aneurysms (incidence < 3%), with only a small number of case reports in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Therefore, there are insufficient data regarding optimal treatment.\n\n【4】The aim of this report is to present an unusual case of a patient with portal hypertension presenting with a large-sized renal vein aneurysm. Proper diagnostic and therapeutic management is discussed.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】Α 40-year-old female patient with history of liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B infection presented complaining of diffuse abdominal pain. Her medical history revealed portal hypertension without ascites or encephalopathy. No acute or distended abdomen was found during physical examination. Moreover, her laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Duplex ultrasonography revealed portal vein thrombosis as well as a left renal vein aneurysm showing increased turbulent venous flow (30 cm/sec). A computed angiography followed that showed an enlarged tortuous left renal vein forming a giant saccular aneurysm (7.8 cm × 6.0 cm) .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Computed angiography showing a large-sized renal vein aneurysm (white arrow) arising from the left renal vein (black arrow).</u>\n\n【8】A vein aneurysm resection or endovascular aneurysm embolization was recommended due to the risk of possible rupture. The patient, however, refused any intervention and decided to be followed up closely. After receiving mild pain therapy for a week, she was discharged, and after one year, she remains asymptomatic.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Although a functional hemodynamic intrarenal disorder is observed in patients with liver cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, there is still no direct association confirmed between portal hypertension and aneurysm formation in renal veins. Portal hypertension remains the main cause for acquired cases of portal vein aneurysm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> although cases of renal vein aneurysms are rare and discovered incidentally most of the times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, our patient had a history of portal vein thrombosis. This type of aneurysms may be asymptomatic or present with abdominal pain and other atypical symptoms when reaching a respectful size as in our case. Regarding the location, renal vein aneurysms are more common on the left side than on the right side due to hemodynamic (“nutcracker phenomenon”) and embryologic factors (formation of left renal vein due to anastomosis of the subcardinal veins) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【11】As far as proper management is concerned, computed tomography imaging using intravenous contrast media remains a useful tool for identifying such aneurysms and designing possible therapeutic strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, Doppler ultrasonography still remains a useful noninvasive imaging modality to easily identify and describe their basic features (size, flow, and location) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Watchful waiting has been recommended with satisfying results although this should be preferably applied in aneurysms of smaller size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. When the risk of rupture is high as in our case or when aneurysms are symptomatic, repair of the aneurysms should be scheduled promptly. In these cases, first therapeutic choice remains the use of interventional percutaneous techniques aiming at aneurysm thrombosis, whereas open vascular reconstructions remain the alternative choice, when vein patency is an issue for target organ viability or the aneurysm itself causes compression to adjacent structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, as underlined by many authors, durability of endovascular techniques needs to be confirmed in long-term follow-up of such patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

An 80-year-old woman was admitted to our department with severe respiratory insufficiency and hemodynamic instability. Abnormal high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and ST-segmental elevation in II, III, aVF, and V3–V6 were present on admission. Segmental motion abnormalities of the left ventricular wall were not detectable in echocardiography. Instead, the presence of a right ventricular strain raised the suspicion of a lung artery embolization. The diagnosis was confirmed by a computed tomography of the chest, and a thrombolytic therapy with 100 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was administered. Though respiratory and hemodynamic stability were established, electromechanical disassociation suddenly occurred 30 hours later and the patient died. Electrocardiographic changes mimicking a myocardial infarction may occur after a massive pulmonary embolism and constitute a diagnostic challenge for clinicians being active in the field of emergency medicine and intensive care.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Since pulmonary arterial imaging emerged as the main diagnostic tool of acute pulmonary embolism, electrocardiographic findings have lost their importance in diagnosing this life-threatening condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although newly introduced electrocardiographic trends have been proposed to consist valuable diagnostic tools in patients with pulmonary artery embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, well-established electrocardiographic changes are mainly implemented as prognostic indicators of clinical outcome, such as development of a secondary pulmonary hypertension, circulatory shock, and in-hospital mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. We present a case of a bilateral lung artery embolization mimicking an acute myocardial infarction.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A woman in her 80s, with no history of cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors, was admitted to our territory medical center with acute dyspnea and sinus tachycardia of 1 hour’s duration. Further symptoms were not assessable, due to an underlying dementia. Shortly before admission, she had a syncope and systemic arterial hypotension of 80/50 mmHg. On her arrival to our emergency department, her heart rate war regular at an average of 110 bpm, respiration rate was 35 per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 80% on ambient air. Results of blood chemistry tests and complete blood cell count revealed a serum lactate of 10 mmol/L (normal range 0.5–1.0 mmol/L) without further abnormalities. The initial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) was 1027 pg/ml (normal range <400 pg/ml), and ST-segment elevation was present in II, III, aVF and V3–V6 of a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) . A bedside echocardiography revealed an acute right ventricular strain, but left ventricular systolic function was normal, without segmental wall motion abnormalities. A computed tomography (CT scan) of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of a bilateral pulmonary artery embolization (PAE) . A rescue thrombolytic therapy with 100 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was administered intravenously. 12 hours later, respiratory stability was achieved and the patient remained hemodynamically stable without catecholamine. Nevertheless, ST-segment elevation persisted and hs-cTnI was still above the normal range with 40.580 pg/ml. A repeated bedside echocardiography revealed improvement of the right ventricular strain and left ventricular systolic function remained intact. However, 30 hours later, electromechanical disassociation suddenly occurred, and the patient died.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showing an ST-segment elevation in II, III, aVF, and V3–V6.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, showing the bilateral pulmonary artery embolization (PAE) (the thin arrow on the right side and the thick arrow on the left side).</u>\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Severe respiratory insufficiency and hemodynamic instability occurred after bilateral pulmonary artery embolization in our case. Abnormal hs-cTnI and ST-segmental elevation in II, III, aVF, and V3–V6, otherwise signs of an acute myocardial infarction, were interpreted in the context of the concurrent right ventricular strain, which was present in echocardiography. Traditional electrocardiographic manifestations of acute cor pulmonale, such as SI QIII or SI QIII TIII pattern, right bundle branch block, P pulmonale, or rightward QRS complex axis shift were absent in the patient’s ECG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. According to a retrospective study by Stein PD et al. the most common electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with acute submassive or massive pulmonary embolism are nonspecific T-wave changes and nonspecific elevation or depression of the RST segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Ischemic signs, mimicking acute coronary syndrome, have been also described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Because segmental motion abnormalities of the left ventricular wall were absent in the admission echocardiography of our case, we avoided performing an emergency coronary angiography, even though both electrocardiographic changes and the elevation of hs-cTnI denoted an ongoing ischemic myocardial trauma. We supposed that the underlying state of severe systemic hypoxemia caused a global myocardial tissue hypoperfusion, which was rather functional than anatomical as observed in conditions of a coronary artery occlusion due to arterial thrombosis.\n\n【11】An additional argument for not performing an emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is that the administered thrombolytic therapy already consisted a validated treatment in the hypothetical case of an underlying acute myocardial infarction, and therefore, both conditions were concurrently treated with this therapeutical approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【12】After thrombolytic therapy was administered, hs-cTnI remained detectable in abnormal levels and ST-segment elevation was present in serial electrocardiographic controls. The persistence of elevated heart enzymes and abnormal electrocardiographic findings up to two weeks after pulmonary artery embolization is a well-described phenomenon and, therefore, raised no worries in the medical team, regarding the issue of a prolonged myocardial hypoperfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【13】However, the coronary status of the patient and the presence of a concurrent myocardial infarction remain uncertain, as a postmortem examination has been opposed from the patient’s relatives. Whether an early coronary angiography could have influenced the clinical course of our case is debatable. The authors believe that even if an acute myocardial infarction was present, thrombolytic therapy was still indicated as the primary treatment option because shock and respiratory insufficiency, due to the underlying pulmonary embolism, were the main clinical manifestations, presenting a vital threatening condition on admission.\n\n【14】#### 4\\.

{"seq_id": "60a25604-fa59-48a4-bfa1-60656dd610b5", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Atorvastatin and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are the most frequently used medication in the world due to very few adverse toxic side effects. One potentially life threatening adverse effect is caused by clinically significant statin induced rhabdomyolysis, either independently or in combination with fusidic acid. The patient in our case who previously had cardiac insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and thoracic aorta aneurysm and was treated with insertion of an endovascular metallic stent in the aorta is presented in the report. He had an inoperable aortitis with an infected stent and para-aortic abscesses with no identified microorganism. The patient responded well to empirical antibiotic treatment with combination therapy of fusidic acid and moxifloxacin. This treatment was planned as a lifelong prophylactic treatment. The patient had been treated with atorvastatin for several years. He developed severe rhabdomyolysis when he was started on fusidic acid and moxifloxacin. The patient made a fast recovery after termination of treatment with atorvastatin and fusidic acid. We here report a life threatening complication of rhabdomyolysis that physicians must be aware of. This can happen either in atorvastatin monotherapy or as a complication of pharmacokinetic interaction between atorvastatin and fusidic acid.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Rhabdomyolysis is most commonly described by “lysis” or disintegration and breakdown of skeletal muscles and subsequent release of toxic intracellular components into the systemic circulation. The major causes of rhabdomyolysis include trauma, infections, hyperthermia, myopathies, and adverse drug-drug interactions of certain medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Statin myotoxicity is a well-known side effect and is related to serum levels of the drugs and can also be influenced by coprescription with other drugs, thus increasing the risk of side effects including rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>. Although it has been reported previously that there is an increased risk of myopathy with coprescription of atorvastatin and fusidic acid, it was not before 2011 that the avoidance of coprescription of this drug combination was recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>. We present a patient already on statin treatment who developed rhabdomyolysis apparently precipitated by fusidic acid. The potential life threatening interaction between atorvastatin and fusidic acid is highlighted in this case report.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A Caucasian man aged 75 years presented to the Emergency Department at the National Hospital, Faroe Islands, with complaints of a two-week history of progressively severe diffuse myalgia, confined to the lower back and proximal lower muscles, reduced power in all four extremities, and generalized weakness, and he was immobile and bedridden. He was neurologically sound and there was no complaint regarding headache, numbness, tingling, or paraesthesia. He denied indulgence in any kind of vigorous physical exercise and over consumption of alcohol. He was already under medication for hypertension and in treatment with rivaroxaban due to atrial fibrillation and atorvastatin 80 mg daily for hyperlipidaemia and on lifelong prophylactic empirical antibiotic treatment with oral fusidic acid 500 mg twice a day combined with oral moxifloxacin 400 mg daily and for an infected aortic aneurysm, with an infected endovascular aortic stent and para-aortic abscesses. He had no familial or prior personal history of muscle disorder and no past history of muscular toxicity with statin or fibrate use. He had been in treatment with atorvastatin for several years. He had been treated with fusidic acid and moxifloxacin for 6 days before the day of admission.\n\n【6】He was afebrile with heart rate 75 beats/minute but hypotensive (103/42 mmHg). The cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tract examination was normal. He complained of moderate discomfort due to myalgia. The quadriceps muscles were tender to palpation and he had reduced power bilaterally. The cranial nerves 2–12 examination was normal. The power 5/5 strength in all the muscle groups was observed, except for the hip flexors and quadriceps which rated 3/5 bilaterally. He was immobile due to weakness. He had normal sensory examinations to light touch, pin prick, and proprioception.\n\n【7】On admission the laboratory measurements revealed the following: hemoglobin 6.4 mmol/L, total leukocyte count 7.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, sodium 140 mmol/L, urea 16.8 mmol/L, creatinine 128 micromol/L, and blood glucose 6.5 mmol/L. Serum muscle enzymes were markedly elevated: creatinine kinase (CK) 328 U/L (reference values: 40–208), LDH 266 U/L (reference values: 115–255), BNP 607 pmol/L (normal up to 28.9), elevated liver function test with ALAT 125 U/L (reference values: 10–70), alkaline phosphatases 232 U/L (reference values: 35–105), and normal bilirubin 9 U/L (reference values: 5–25). Table 1 describes the levels of CK, myoglobin, creatinine, and urea (the combination was stopped on 6th day after admission). Urine analysis showed no significant microscopic hematuria or proteinuria. The patient was also screened for autoimmune diseases: autoantibody p-ANCA (IgG) with medium positive result (nonconclusive), autoantibody c-ANCA (IgG) negative, and autoantibody ANA negative. These results made the differential diagnoses immunological vasculitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) unlikely. The rheumatological differential diagnoses polymyositis and dermatomyositis were unlikely because of negative autoantibodies known to be associated to polymyositis and dermatomyositis . A spinal tap was performed to rule out Guillain-Barré syndrome as differential diagnosis. The spinal tap showed no pleocytosis, normal protein, and normal glucose level in the cerebrospinal fluid. An MRI of the cervical spine showed a nonsignificant spinal stenosis at the C5/C6 level, which did not explain the symptomatology of the patient. Finally because of negative HMG-CoA reductase antibodies (IgG), associated to autoimmune statin induced rhabdomyolysis, this differential diagnosis was unlikely in our patient . Therefore, considering the clinical development, the kinetics of the biochemical markers, and the medication history, we assume that the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis as a consequence to combination therapy with atorvastatin and fusidic acid is highly likely. Treatment with atorvastatin and fusidic acid was halted on 6th day after admission and approximately 12th day since the combination started. Fusidic acid was changed to oral Co-amoxiclav 500/125 mg tid and the patient continued on atorvastatin and oral moxifloxacin 400 mg daily. The patient was treated with intravenous fluid and physiotherapy.\n\n【8】Table 1 Muscle and kidney function biomarkers during the admission. The combination of atorvastatin and fusidic acid stopped at day 6 since admission.\n\n【9】Table 2 Screening for autoantibodies known to be associated to polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and isolated statin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) causing myalgia.\n\n【10】The patient was discharged after 5 weeks with remarkable improvement of symptoms. When he left hospital the biochemical markers revealed normal muscle enzymes with CK 71 U/L, myoglobin 94 ng/L, and normal transaminases . It was decided not to treat the patient with fusidic acid in the future.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The graph shows the levels of creatinine kinase (CK) and myoglobulin in the \\-axis and the admission days in the \\-axis. The rapid fall and normalization of the CK and myoglobulin in our patient, after cessation of treatment with atorvastatin and fusidic acid on 6th day prior to admission, clearly suggest the diagnosis of pharmacokinetic interaction between atorvastatin and fusidic acid as cause of rhabdomyolysis.</u>\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Statins are HMG-CoA inhibitors (hydroxymethylglutaryl/coenzyme A) and they lower the cholesterol levels by competitively inhibiting the HMG-CoA reductase, the final pathway in cholesterol biosynthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>. The three statins (lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin) are metabolized by the cytochrome p-450 3A4 (CYP-3A4) isoenzymes, whereas pravastatin is metabolized in the liver by sulfation and fluvastatin is metabolized by the cytochrome 2C9 isoenzyme (CYP-2C9) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Rhabdomyolysis is one of the complications of myopathies. The risk of myopathies and rhabdomyolysis is increased by the concomitant administration of fusidic acid with statins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Plasma concentration of statins significantly increases by coadministration of fusidic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7, 9\\]</u>. The mechanism of interaction, whether it is pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics or both, is still unknown. Reports have shown rhabdomyolysis, including some fatal cases, in patients receiving combination of fusidic acid and its salts with oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, other coumarin derivatives, or anticoagulant; this may also increase plasma concentration of these anticoagulant agents, thus enhancing the anticoagulant effects with risk of bleeding. An interaction between fusidic acid and drugs biotransformed via CYP-3A4 system is suspected. Apparently the mechanism of this interaction is possibly mutual inhibition of metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However, recent studies suggest fusidic acid inhibits hepatic transporters and metabolic enzymes which may cause drug-drug interaction with statin coadministration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The mortality rate associated with statin induced rhabdomyolysis is approximately 0.15 deaths per 1 million 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 11\\]</u> and it is considered as a rare side effect involving less than 0.1% of patients on statin treatment. The FDA database reports a mortality rate of 7.8% in patients with rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 12\\]</u>. Cerivastatin was previously one of the most commonly implicated statin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 11\\]</u>. Due to more than 100 fatal outcomes linked to rhabdomyolysis, it was withdrawn from the market in August 2001 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Factors increasing the plasma concentration of the statins increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis and hepatitis. These include concomitant use of lipid lowering drugs, hosts genetic factors, and drug interactions with other medications that are metabolized by the same cytochrome p-450 system of enzymes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 13\\]</u>. Risk factors for these adverse effects include renal disease, hepatic dysfunction, diabetes, age above 80 years, and hypothyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 14, 15\\]</u>. The most common medications affecting statin metabolism, apart from fusidic acid, are fibrates (especially gemfibrozil), cyclosporine, warfarin, digoxin, macrolides, azole antifungals, calcium channel blockers, and amiodarone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 14–16\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The mainstay treatment of rhabdomyolysis is hydration and increasing diuresis. Diuresis protects the kidneys by diluting myoglobin in the renal tubules and hence prevents the toxic cast formation and also promotes the excretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Mannitol and urine alkalinization are also indicated in the treatment of rhabdomyolysis. To our knowledge there are no specific guidelines, but The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology and the European Association of Poisons Centre and Clinical Toxicologists have issued a paper recommending administration of a bolus of 225 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate intravenously over 1 h, followed by additional intravenous boluses q. 1 h, to maintain pH between 7.5 and 8.5. Another regimen is to add 1–3 amps (50 mEq/50 cc) of sodium bicarbonate from 8.4% to 0.9% or 0.45% normal saline or 5% D5W 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In all regimes, high recommendations have been made to monitor the pH, serum potassium, and arterial pH hourly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】This case report is highlighting the importance of early recognition and treatment of this rare but potentially fatal side effect, rhabdomyolysis, caused by use of the statin group of drugs, either separately or combined with fusidic acid. If statins are used to treat patients, fusidic acid should not be used. In conditions where life threatening infection is involved and fusidic acid is the only antibiotic option available, it is suggested that all statin treatments should be set on a halt, as long as the patient is receiving fusidic acid.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The computed tomography (CT) scan later aided in an accurate diagnosis. Symptomatic huge ACKD has, to our knowledge, scarcely been described. In addition, retroperitoneal lesions resulting in abdominal pain remain unusual and underrecognized in general practice.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】A cystic kidney disease is a group of conditions that cause fluid-filled sacs to form in or around the kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is attributed to a broad spectrum of etiologies, including inherited, acquired, and systemic disease-related conditions. One of the most common causes is acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Whilst the great majority (approximately 86% of cases) are asymptomatic, certain patients may develop hematuria, lower back pain, and urinary tract infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Abdominal pain is thus claimed to be an unusual presentation. Various pain characteristics have been described, including dull, uncomfortable fullness, stabbing, and cramping 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We herein reported a rare case of an elderly patient who was ultimately diagnosed with infected ACKD, initially presented with acute abdominal pain.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 85-year-old male was evaluated at this hospital because of acute abdominal pain. His comorbidities included essential hypertension, old myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, and gouty arthritis. No family history of early-onset chronic kidney disease was documented. Two years earlier, he had the first episode of urinary tract infection (UTI), which was resolved with a ten-day course of oral antibiotics at another hospital. One week after treatment, he underwent a kidney ultrasound examination to evaluate the possibility of complicated UTI. However, it revealed no abnormalities. The patient had been in his usual state of health until ten days before admission to our hospital, when acute abdominal pain, constipation, early satiety, and nausea developed. Abdominal pain was generalized, dull, 6 out of 10 in severity, and gradually worsened. He denied other organ-specific symptoms, except for a low-grade fever. He had never undergone abdominal surgery. On examination, the temperature was 38.4°C, the blood pressure was 127/73 mm·Hg, the heart rate was 86 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. His abdomen was soft and moderately distended with slight but diffuse tenderness to soft touch and normal bowel sounds. The remainder of the examination was normal. A digital rectal examination revealed hard, brown stool with no blood or mucus. Plain film of the abdomen demonstrated a large well-defined high-density shadow on the left upper quadrant abdomen, deviating left colon to the central abdomen, without significant bowel dilatation . He then underwent computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, which disclosed multiple, variable-sized, thin-walled, well-marginated cysts in both kidneys . The diameter of the cysts ranged from 3.5 to 13.0 cm, and it showed internal hyperdensity (16–20 Hounsfield units). Both kidney sizes were of normal size and had normal parenchyma without solid components. A complete blood count revealed a leukocyte count of 12,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> with neutrophil predominance (79%). His serum creatinine was 2.13 mg/dL without proteinuria. Urinary analysis showed leukocyturia (a urine white blood cell count of 30–50 cells/high power field) with nitrite positive. After he was diagnosed with bilateral multiple infected acquired renal cysts, ciprofloxacin was administered intravenously. Four days later, his fever and abdominal pain had largely diminished. The hemoculture was reported negative and urine culture grew Escherichia coli. After his clinical conditions improved, ciprofloxacin was switched to oral form, and he was referred to a urologist for further evaluation and considering an evaluation for kidney transplantation.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Supine (a) and upright (b) abdominal radiographs revealed a large well-defined soft tissue opacity at the left upper quadrant of abdomen, deviating left-sided colon medially. No signs of bowel obstruction were noted.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Coronal (a) and axial (b) CT images of the abdomen revealed multiple, variable-sized, thin-walled cysts in both kidneys. The diameter of the cysts ranged from 3.5–13.0 cm. Some renal cysts had higher attenuation with perinephric fat stranding, representing infected renal cysts.</u>\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】A spectrum of adult renal cystic diseases was categorized into hereditary and non-hereditary conditions. The common causes in patients with multiple renal cysts remain autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), ACKD, and simple renal cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Our patient was diagnosed with acquired renal cysts since his kidney sizes were of normal size and he had normal parenchyma. Yet, there were neither extrarenal cysts nor a positive family history of early-onset chronic renal diseases nor other organ-specific manifestations. His impaired renal function made the diagnosis of simple renal cysts unlikely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In addition, the congenital causes are less likely attributed to his clinical presentations because of his old age and no abnormal findings on the previous kidney ultrasound.\n\n【10】The four cardinal symptoms of bowel obstruction are pain, vomiting, obstipation (or constipation), and distention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However, these tetrads were neither specific (28–61%) nor sensitive (56–75%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Therefore, the clinical features alone might not aid in recognizing and promptly managing bowel obstruction. Our patient presented with bowel obstruction-like symptoms with no history of abdominal surgery. Aside from partial bowel obstruction, conditions that had to be considered in a differential diagnosis included acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, mesenteric ischemia, and mesenteric artery ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. A plain film of the abdomen revealed a mass-like shadow on the left upper quadrant abdomen without any evidence of bowel dilatation. Furthermore, CT abdomen revealed bilateral multiple huge renal cysts extended anteriorly toward intra-abdominal organs. The stretched peritoneum reasonably explains his generalized abdominal pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This case reminds us that a pattern recognition process or an intuitive approach in diagnosis has its limits in certain situations, particularly with highly incoherent data. Alternative strategies for generating differential diagnosis include anatomic approach, and systems approach, under a hypothetico-deductive method with critical thinking and clinical reasoning, may provide a more comprehensive range of possible conditions in this clinical setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【11】ACKD is a condition commonly found in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, presenting with multiple bilateral cysts, which are usually between 0.5 and 3 cm in diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The prevalence of ACKD was approximately 7% and 22% in pre-dialysis patients and dialysis patients, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Common imaging techniques including ultrasonography, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play an indispensable role in the diagnosis, prognostic staging, and management. In spite of the fact that ultrasound provides the most cost-effective option, CT and MRI demonstrate greater resolution with a high sensitivity and specificity particularly for detecting renal cysts less than one centimeter in diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. Whilst its pathogenesis had not been well understood, it was postulated that nephron loss contributed to compensatory kidney hypertrophy, resulting in tubular hyperplasia and cyst formation. The process was mediated by activation of proto-oncogenes—which was presumably attributed to renal cell carcinoma (RCC)—and release of growth factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. The cyst stems from proximal tubules, and its fluid derives from the ultrafiltrate, transepithelial solute, and fluid secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. The incidence of RCC was 4–7% over 7–10 years of follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21,22\\]</u>. To date, there is no consensus regarding the proper modality and frequency of imaging to detect RCC progression from ACKD. However, modalities—reported in previous studies—included ultrasound, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 23–25\\]</u>. Among imaging studies for diagnosing renal cell carcinoma, the diagnostic performance of unenhanced ultrasound was poor. Vogel et al. revealed that median sensitivity and specificity of CT abdomen were 88% and 75%, respectively. Also, median sensitivity and specificity of MRI abdomen were 87.5% and 89%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【12】According to his cyst infection, common pathogens included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, Citrobacter diversus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus spp. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Lipid-soluble antibiotics—for instance, fluoroquinolones—demonstrated excellent penetration into cysts; however, resistant strains were increasingly being identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 28\\]</u>. Because of their properties, these regimens were favored 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The ACKD patients with pain or abdominal fullness from mass effect are treated symptomatically. Because of the rarity of cases with symptoms, the gold standard of definite treatment in patients with ACKD has not been well established. Based on previous studies of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, nephrectomy may be needed in cases with intractable pain and cyst-related complications including retroperitoneal bleeding, persistent or severe hematuria, recurrent and severe cyst infection, infected stones, and suspicion of renal cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Moreover, a recent study revealed that trans-arterial embolization of enlarged polycystic kidneys appears to be an advantageous alternative to nephrectomy before renal transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. In patients with kidney transplants, the recipient kidney was smaller in size and had milder grade of severity compared to those treated with hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Although no recurrence of his symptoms had been detected, he was referred to experienced nephrologists and urologists for an early discussion of the surgical intervention. After discussion, the preferred management was close monitoring and the invasive intervention would be re-considered if indicated. In our case, no evidence of RCC had yet been found in CT abdomen findings. We advised our patient to undergo CT abdomen scanning to assess the progression of the disease and screen for RCC every 1-2 years, based on its growth rate of 1 cm per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33, 34\\]</u>.\n\n【13】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【14】Our case exemplifies the importance of constructing a wide differential diagnosis in patients without prior abdominal surgery presenting with bowel obstruction-like symptoms. Retroperitoneal lesions, although rare, can cause abdominal pain and bowel obstruction-like symptoms. Careful radiographic examination and thoughtful evaluation of clinically relevant information is of importance to establish an accurate diagnosis and provide proper treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This tumor has a grave prognosis. We report to the best of our knowledge the first case of infantile scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumor in a 6-month-old male baby who presented with a right parietal scalp mass since the age of 1 month. This mass was initially diagnosed as scalp hemangioma based on clinical and imaging findings. However, this mass was growing fast which necessitated excision. Pathologic examination after excision showed a malignant tumor composed of sheets of rhabdoid cells. Immunohistochemically, this tumor tested positive for vimentin, CD 99, glypican-3, synaptopysin, WT-1, CK, and EMA. INI-1 immunostain was lost in the tumor cells. Subsequently, this tumor was pathologically diagnosed as extracranial scalp rhabdoid tumor. After tumor excision, the patient was referred to pediatric oncology to receive chemotherapy. Experience with scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumors is limited. However, this tumor in other organs carries a grave prognosis. Although scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumor is an extremely rare tumor, it should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of infantile scalp masses given the need of combined surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Masses in the head have a broad differential diagnosis and are usually divided into congenital versus acquired. Usually, CT and MRI are used in the evaluation of these masses initially.

The patient was referred to pediatric oncology for staging and treatment.\n\n【21】This patient was treated according to the European rhabdoid protocol. However, the patient received just intensive chemotherapy as there was no role for radiotherapy or for autologous bone marrow transplant because of the age of the patient. The intensive chemotherapy given was composed of multiple chemotherapy regimens including the following chemotherapeutic agents: doxorubicin, ifosfamide, carboplatinum, etopside, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and actinomycin-D.\n\n【22】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【23】Rhabdoid tumors can involve the CNS primarily and are termed atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT).

After surgical excision and pathologic diagnosis, the patient was referred to pediatric oncology for treatment. Given the rarity of malignant extracranial rhabdoid tumor, standardized treatment protocols have not yet been popularized worldwide.

{"seq_id": "72eb392c-4d26-4fbc-b68b-d82417b6ea61", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic used in refractory schizophrenia and depression. Its use is often complicated by its vast side-effect profile including cardiovascular reactions, agranulocytosis, and seizures. Specifically, the cardiac complications of clozapine have been shown to predominantly cause myocarditis and pericarditis. In this case report, the case of a 58-year-old male being treated for treatment-resistant depression and schizophrenia who suffers from tachycardia is presented. He is treated empirically for orthostatic hypotension with IV fluids without much success. Further imaging and echocardiography demonstrated a pericardial effusion, a rare reaction (≤1 : 10000) that has only been documented in a handful of case reports. This anecdotal evidence highlights the significance of polyserositis/pericardial effusion in the context of clozapine-induced orthostatic hypotension resistant to rehydration. When starting a patient on clozapine, it is important to consider further workup and monitoring with laboratory baseline biomarkers and cardiac evaluation with symptomatic individuals. Upon immediate cessation of clozapine, the pericardial effusion should spontaneously resolve without complication and should not be rechallenged.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Clozapine has been significant in its efficacy as an antipsychotic drug for treatment-resistant psychotic depression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Despite its lower risk of tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms, its use as an effective agent has been limited and complicated by its adverse side-effect profile. The most severe side effects include agranulocytosis, respiratory depression, and seizures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However, there have been multiple uncommon adverse cardiovascular effects noted with its use, including hypotension, cardiac conduction abnormalities, tachycardia, myocarditis, polyserositis, and pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. In particular, there have been very few reports of clozapine-induced pericardial effusion; hence, it is often disregarded as a potential etiology. In this report, we present a 58-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who is treated with clozapine and has a subsequent moderate pericardial effusion and orthostatic hypotension. We will discuss the initial clinical management and diagnostic rule out during admission, as well as the resolution with immediate discontinuation of the medication.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 58-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hypertension, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, and panic disorder was admitted to inpatient psychiatry with symptoms of suicidal ideation and auditory hallucinations. He had failed trials of multiple antidepressants and antipsychotics. A month into his admission, due to treatment-resistant depression, he was started on clozapine 100 mg PO BID and lithium 300 mg PO daily. 12 days after the initiation of the medications, he developed the new onset of tachycardia ranging between 110–130s bpm and had a brief febrile episode of 102.5 F a couple days later. He underwent a U/A which showed cloudy urine with moderate leukocyte esterase, white blood cells 15–30, and few bacteria. The patient at the time did not note any dysuria or other urinary complaints.\n\n【6】He was initially recommended admission and started oral ciprofloxacin, which was immediately switched to IV ceftriaxone x3 days for a presumptive diagnosis of UTI. At initial evaluation, he was empirically treated with a bolus of IV fluids for orthostatic hypotension (supine 115/72, upright 103/59 mmHg). On admission, chest X-ray demonstrated no acute findings  and EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 109 bpm with low-voltage QRS. His basic metabolic panel, TSH, fT4, and complete blood count were unremarkable as well. During his stay, he continued to have persistent tachycardia with a peak of 153 bpm despite completing the antibiotic regimen and IV fluids. Given his persistent tachycardia and concern for thrombus, he underwent a CTA chest  with contrast which demonstrated moderate pericardial effusion with subcentimeter bilateral hilar lymph nodes. Given the low-voltage QRS findings, he also had a TEE performed which demonstrated grossly normal LV function with small pericardial effusion present, without evidence of tamponade. A repeat EKG demonstrated similar sinus tachycardia at a rate of 118 bpm with low-voltage QRS. For the duration of admission, he had no complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, or discomfort.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Frontal (a) and lateral (b) chest X-ray images demonstrating no abnormalities or signs of pericardial effusion.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CTA chest with (a) and without (b) contrast enhancement demonstrating the moderate pericardial effusion. No pleural effusion or other abnormalities are present.</u>\n\n【9】There was a discussion with the psychiatry team regarding concerns for the vast side effects from recently prescribed clozapine vs. moderate dehydration. He received more IV fluids, and clozapine was promptly discontinued. Infectious disease was consulted, and further workup demonstrated negative coxsackie B but a positive coxsackie A virus with titers 1 : 800. This was a confounding etiology for the pericardial effusion, despite limited literature supporting coxsackie A as a cause for a pericardial effusion. Blood and urine cultures were negative at the time as well. Although after discussion, alternative etiologies such as SLE, uremia, or malignancy were considered, limited clinical suspicion rendered further workup unnecessary at that time. Given the subacute presentation in the setting of a probable offending medication, idiopathic etiology was deemed less likely.\n\n【10】Only 3 days after discontinuation of clozapine, his tachycardia had spontaneously resolved, and a repeat EKG showed a resolved normal sinus rhythm at 91 bpm with normal QRS voltage. No treatment of the pericarditis was initiated given the presumed cause related to a medication adverse effect. His vitals continued to remain stable, and he was subsequently discharged home.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic which is often used as a last resort in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The dangerous side-effect profile includes agranulocytosis, seizures, respiratory depression, and a multitude of cardiovascular complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. This particular case is of interest, as there are only a handful of reported cases of pericardial effusion (polyserositis) and fewer still with concomitant orthostatic hypotension. According to the American College of Cardiology, there is a ≤ 1 : 100 risk of suffering from the adverse effect of orthostatic hypotension. Despite myocarditis/pericarditis being ≤1 : 10000 risk, pericardial effusion was still not established as an adverse outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As per French imputability of casualty assessment, this reaction received a designation of C1S3I2B2. This case report highlights the importance of careful cardiac monitoring in patients that are taking clozapine.\n\n【13】There are no published guidelines for managing and monitoring associated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and pericarditis outcomes from clozapine. However, there is well-documented evidence that markers including CRP, ESR, troponins, BNP, and echocardiography are all potentially useful in evaluating a baseline prior to regimen initiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In our case specifically, inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP were not obtained. Having baseline reference labs could have expedited the prediction of the underlying etiology of pericardial effusion/pericarditis. In addition, leukocytosis is another marker of pericardial syndrome. This was not identified during our patient’s hospital course, despite evidence of multiple other case reports with these findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Some studies have shown the onset of eosinophilia may also predict cardiac outcomes associated with clozapine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In patient outcomes of sudden cardiac death, there were found to be cardiac eosinophilic infiltrates with myocytolysis, attributed to a hypersensitivity drug reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, in this report, eosinophils in serum remained stable and within normal limits for the duration of admission. Despite strong evidence for using laboratory biomarkers in identifying a pericardial complication, they may not always be present. This may necessitate the use of further imaging studies to confirm a diagnosis.\n\n【14】During presentation of subacute tachycardia without any apparent pathology, in the context of clozapine initiation, a more robust cardiac evaluation with necessary imaging is likely to be beneficial. Given that the adverse effect of pericardial effusion can manifest at any point, from one week to years after treatment initiation, serious considerations for monitoring should be taken 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. By obtaining a TEE early in the treatment course, we were able to obtain a timely and definitive diagnosis. This allowed for prompt discontinuation of clozapine and helped avoid any severe forms of pericardial tamponade, a potentially fatal complication. Spontaneous resolution of the effusion, as seen in our case, can also be seen in many other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7, 8\\]</u>. The 9.1 to 17.4 hr half-life of clozapine corresponds well with the several-day resolution seen following cessation of the drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The mechanism of the various clozapine-associated cardiovascular side effects is not well understood. Researchers have suggested sympathetic hyperactivity, decreased vagal tone, and cholinergic and adrenergic inhibition as potential causes. Since there is a lack of trials to demonstrate these pathophysiologies, studies that further elucidate the adverse effects and potential intervention and prevention strategies will be particularly valuable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Following cessation, recommendations include careful supportive care only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Follow-up EKG has been noted in prior studies, but despite lack of an evidence-based criterion, this is at the provider’s discretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A literature review found that patients rechallenged with clozapine after agranulocytosis and myocarditis had poorer outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【17】An important takeaway from this case was that nonspecific tachycardia in the context of recent clozapine initiation should be closely monitored for an extended spectrum of cardiac toxicity. This should include preliminary laboratory markers for inflammation and leukocytosis (specifically eosinophilia). If IV fluids do not resuscitate the orthostasis, prompt evaluation with TEE should be considered to allow for quick discontinuation of the offending agent, clozapine.\n\n【18】#### Abbreviations\n\n| PO: | Per os (by mouth) |\n| --- | --- |\n| BID: | Bis in die (twice daily) |\n| U/A: | Urinary analysis |\n| UTI: | Urinary tract infection |\n| EKG: | Electrocardiogram |\n| IV: | Intravenous |\n| CTA: | Computerized tomography angiography |\n| TSH: | Thyroid-stimulating hormone |\n| fT4: | Free thyroxine |\n| LV: | Left ventricle |\n| BP: | Blood pressure |\n| TEE: | Transesophageal echocardiogram |\n| CRP: | C-reactive protein |\n| ESR: | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate |\n| BNP: | Basic natriuretic peptide |\n| SLE: | Systemic lupus erythematosus. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Case Reports\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Case  1\n\n【6】A 52-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room because of a headache, fever (39°C), alternating with hypothermia, confusion, and weakness in the left leg. The patient also reported diarrhea, loss of appetite, and weight loss of 12 kilograms in the past three months. He had been diagnosed with HIV infection a few days before his admission. He denied previous diseases, using continuous medication, and previous hospital admissions or surgeries.\n\n【7】At the physical examination, the patient presented a regular status with confusion, isochoric and photoreactive pupils, and no signs of meningeal irritation, but a loss of force in the left leg. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed an area of hypodensity in the white matter on the upper convexity of the right frontal lobe. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a hypersignal in T2 on the upper and lower right frontal gyri, in the left occipital lobe, and lesions with ring enhancement in the deep upper left temporal sulcus . Laboratory exams showed a lymphocyte CD4 count of 94 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and HIV viral load of 479,365 copies ml. A reactive serological test for syphilis showed a titer 1 : 8, which was previously treated with penicillin G benzathine. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 3 leucocytes/mm3, proteins of 28 mg/dL, and glucose of 39 mg/dL. CSF cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. PCR testing for JCPyV virus was negative. However, PCR testing for BKPyV was positive. Detection of BKPyV consisted of a semi-nested PCR with two 20-base oligomer primers (PEP-1 and PEP-2) followed by second round PCR with 40-nucleotide sequence (BEP-1 and PEP-1), as previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The length of the BKPyV targeted for amplification was 176 nucleotide pairs. At this same hospitalization, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, and a regime of rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid was provided. The patient was started on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, he presented signs of sepsis of unknown origin twenty days after the admission and died three days later.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 A magnetic resonance image showed a hyperintensity in T2 on the upper and lower right frontal gyri, in the left occipital lobe, and lesions with annular enhancement in the deep upper left temporal sulcus (case report 1).</u>\n\n【9】##### 2.2. Case  2\n\n【10】A 45-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of headaches, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, dyspnea, loss of appetite, and fever. She had been diagnosed with HIV infection one month before. The patient was taking sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine due to a presumptive diagnosis of neurotoxoplasmosis in a previous recent hospitalization. On the physical examination, the patient was lethargic, with pain at palpation. She presented a severe immunosuppression with a CD4-T lymphocyte count of 23 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and a viral load of 167,580 copies/ml. Cerebral MRI showed mild volume loss with scattered FLAIR hyperintensities and asymmetric lesions without mass effect . The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed 8 leucocytes/mm3, protein 133 mg/dL, and glucose 40 mg/dl. Cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were negative. PCR testing for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, herpes zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and JC virus was negative. However, the sample was positive for the presence of BKPyV and cytomegalovirus. She continued to receive empiric treatment for neurotoxoplasmosis. During the hospitalization, she presented impaired renal function, which was attributed to sulfadiazine. It was also considered the hypothesis of BK renal infection, reinforced by a positive PCR testing for BKPYV in the urine. The patient was started on HAART (zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz). She was discharged after 62 days of hospitalization with partial neurological improvement.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Cerebral MRI currently shows mild volume loss with scattered FLAIR hyperintensities and asymmetric lesions without mass effect (case report 2).</u>\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】BKPyV encephalitis has been reported in patients with depression of their immune function including patients with renal allograft: hematooncological diseases undergoing chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, long-term steroid therapy, and HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–11\\]</u>. However, BKPyV has been detected in asymptomatic apparently healthy and immunocompetent individuals, with self-limited clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. To date, since the first report of BKPyV associated neurological infection almost 20 years ago, only eight cases have been described in patients with AIDS  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14–22\\]</u>. As observed in our two patients, the most common symptom is a headache. Other signs of neurological impairment include seizures, progressive mental deterioration, dysarthria, hallucinations, visual disturbances, and in one case paraplegia. BKPyV retinitis has been described in AIDS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Imaging of CNS infection by BKPyV is characterized by a preferential involvement of the periventricular and pial surfaces of the brain parenchyma. In fact, magnetic resonance imaging of the cases of BKPyV meningoencephalitis has shown areas of increased signal intensity of the periventricular white matter of brain while the cortex is generally spared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9\\]</u>. Meningeal contrast enhancement along with increased meningeal thickness also occurs when infection spread to meningitis is present. Deep white matter of the cerebellum is generally spared while deep gray matter structures are compromised. As shown in Table 1, the diagnosis of BKPyV encephalitis has usually been established by PCR testing of the CSF in the majority of the patients and sometimes complemented or not by BKPyV PCR of the brain biopsy specimen. The lack of demonstration of the virus in the brain tissue sample has been frequently observed in the reported cases, either by immunohistochemistry or by in situ hybridization. If a patient shows neurological symptoms without a positive serology and PCR for other pathogens (namely, viral agents such as JCV, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus), while a positive PCR for BKPyV is present in the CSF/brain tissue, it strongly favors the diagnosis of a BKPyV meningoencephalitis.\n\n【14】Table 1 Characteristics of HIV-infected patients with BKV encephalitis.\n\n【15】There is no established treatment of BKPyV infection. Antiviral agents such as cidofovir, leflunomide, IVIG, and quinolones have been used in refractory cases of BKPyV nephropathy and cystitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22–25\\]</u>. However, the effectiveness of these agents is doubtful and some of them can cause severe side effects. However, in the few reported cases of BKPyV encephalitis, therapy has been restricted to the use of antiretroviral therapy. Consequently, overall mortality of the reported cases has been high, 70% of the reported cases in the literature. In summary, BKPyV meningoencephalitis is an emerging disease in HIV-infected patients. Physicians should be aware to recognize the main clinical features and diagnose BKPyV meningoencephalitis. Specific antiviral therapy is an urgent need for treatment of BKPyV infection.\n\n【16】#### Competing Interests\n\n【17】The authors declared that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) is a step toward the development of minimally invasive surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–5\\]</u>. However, LESS may be initially difficult for surgeons who have limited experience with it, even if they are experienced in traditional laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【4】We describe two cases of left adrenalectomy with a combined technique using LESS and the addition of an accessory port. This procedure is easy and safe for surgeons who have no experience with LESS. We, therefore, hope that it can be a bridge between the conventional laparoscopic approach and LESS.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】We experienced two cases of left adrenal tumor excised using a transperitoneal approach with a combined technique using LESS and an additional accessory port.\n\n【7】Case 1. A 54-year-old man (body mass index (BMI), 21.7) presented with hypertension and hypokalemia to our hospital. At examination, his serum aldosterone level was elevated, and computed tomography (CT) revealed a 15-mm left adrenal mass . According to the results of selective sampling of aldosterone through the venous circulation, he was diagnosed with primary aldosteronism. The operative time was 167 min (blood loss, 20 mL). A 6-mm tubular drain through the incision was left in situ. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient started oral intake and was ambulatory on the first postoperative day and was discharged from the hospital on the eighth postoperative day. Pathologic examination confirmed cortical adenoma of the adrenal grand.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Preoperative CT scans and postoperative specimens of Cases 1 and 2, who underwent left adrenalectomy with combined technique using LESS with an additional accessory port. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】Case 2. A 69-year-old woman (BMI, 24.4) with a diagnosis of hypertension presented to our hospital.

I通用删除4(英):<u><sup>131</sup></u>\\-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy did not reveal a functional lesion around the left adrenal grand. The patient was diagnosed with suspected pheochromocytoma and was given 4 mg of doxazosin to correct her circulating plasma volume. The operative time was 165 min (blood loss, 20 mL). A 6-mm tubular drain was not left in place in this case. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, as with Case 1. The patient started oral intake and was ambulatory on the first postoperative day and was discharged from the hospital on the tenth postoperative day. Pathologic examination confirmed cortical adenoma of the adrenal grand.  \nBoth patients required analgesic agents on the first postoperative day but not during discharge.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Surgical Technique\n\n【11】Surgery was performed with the patient at a 45° angle modified flank position under CO<sub>2</sub> pneumoperitoneum and 12-cm H<sub>2</sub>O. No multichannel trocar was used as a single port. First, a 2.5-cm skin incision using the Hasson open technique was made at the level of the paraumbilicus for insertion of the primary 12-mm trocar for the laparoscope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Second, a 5-mm nonbladed trocar was placed side-by-side with the primary trocar through the skin incision with endoscopic control. A 3-mm nonbladed trocar was then placed along the anterior axillary line; afterward, the abdomen was inspected .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Trocar placement for left adrenalectomy with the LESS combined technique. The primary 12-mm trocar (A) and a 5-mm nonbladed trocar (B) were located next to one another through a 2.5-cm skin incision.

The surgical strategy was conventional left transperitoneal adrenalectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Once the white line of Toldt was incised using a combination of 3-mm monopolar scissors (held in the surgeon’s right hand) and 5-mm monopolar forceps (held in the surgeon’s left hand) 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>, the junction of the colonic mesentery and Gerota’s fascia was identified 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b))</u>. This plane was then dissected to the renal vein 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c))</u>. The adrenal veins were identified, clipped with 5-mm Hem-O-Lok clips (Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA), held in the surgeon’s left hand, and divided. A 5-mm vessel-sealing device (LigaSure V, COVIDIEN, CT, USA; held in the surgeon’s left hand) was also used to complete the adrenal dissection 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(d))</u>. The specimen was extracted by removing the 10-mm bag (Endo Catch Gold, COVIDIEN, CT, USA) through the enlarged paraumbilical trocar site by connecting the primary12- and 5-mm ports.

Discussion\n\n【17】Traditional laparoscopic urologic surgery requires at least 3 or 4 ports and an additional incision to remove the specimen. On the other hand, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) represents the ultimate in minimally invasive surgery by avoiding abdominal wall incision altogether 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. A procedure that minimizes these incisions as one larger incision is single-port (access and incision) laparoscopic surgery, also known as LESS.\n\n【18】Adrenalectomy with LESS is suitable in patients with a minor adrenal tumor, since the operative scar is small and therefore unnoticeable. Consequently, this procedure has gained acceptance as a suitable alternative to standard laparoscopic adrenalectomy for small adrenal masses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. However, surgeons with limited experience in LESS may have difficulty secondary to the reduced triangulation, fog evacuation, and clashing of instruments. We have, therefore, described adrenalectomy with a combined technique using LESS with the addition of an accessory port and hope this will be a bridge between conventional laparoscopy and that with LESS approaches.\n\n【19】In our experience, adrenalectomy with the LESS combined technique is easy and safe. To perform adrenalectomy with LESS alone, the surgeon must be skilled in the use of the surgical instruments, which include articulable dissectors or scissors. However, the technique presented in the current study requires no instruments in addition to common equipment and materials (rigid scissors or vessel-sealing devices) readily available in the operating room, with the exception of a flexible laparoscope. Consequently, surgeons who have no experience with LESS could likely perform it easily, and this procedure could lead to the next step, which is pure LESS surgery.\n\n【20】In the current cases, we used a 12-mm trocar for the laparoscope despite using a flexible 5-mm laparoscope, since we originally assumed usage with a rigid laparoscope (about 10 mm in diameter). If we had selected a 5-mm trocar for a flexible 5-mm laparoscope from the beginning, the skin incision might have been shorter than 2.5 cm. Therefore, our procedure may have room for improvement.\n\n【21】In conclusion, adrenalectomy with the LESS combined technique is easier than that with LESS alone and could, therefore, be useful to surgeons who have no experience in LESS and may be considering using it in their practice. We, therefore, hope this procedure can be a bridge between the conventional laparoscopic approach and LESS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Under local anaesthesia, affected lumbar discs were curetted using a procedure of percutaneous nucleotomy, and in-tube and the out-tube were placed for continuous irrigation. The period of continuous irrigation was 12–16 days. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was demonstrated in case 1 by culture and PCR, whereas histology showed tuberculous lesion with caseous necrosis in both cases. Postoperative MRI showed markedly reduced abscesses after 3 months in both cases. The signal intensity in vertebral bodies was improved. In Case 2, CT observations showed remodeling over time in the vertebral body cavities. This method is advantageous in that although minimally invasive, it achieves identification of pathogenic bacteria and treatment simultaneously. This surgical procedure is expected to prove effective for both TB and pyogenic spondylitis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Since tuberculous (TB) spondylitis does not induce strong acute inflammation such as that observed for pyogenic spondylitis, patients are unlikely to visit a clinic immediately after onset and tend to be diagnosed after progression of bone destruction and abscess formation, even if neurological dysfunction has not yet developed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】As for treatment, conservative therapy using antituberculous agents has been used for early-stage disease without nerve paralysis and with little destruction of vertebral bodies, while surgical therapy aimed at focal resection and spinal reconstruction has been performed in cases displaying advanced bone destruction combined with paralysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Recently, as an application of minimally invasive percutaneous nucleotomy (PN) under local anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, good surgical outcomes have been reported for pyogenic spondylitis using percutaneous curettage and continuous irrigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. The present report describes the good results obtained using this technique of PN for definitive diagnosis (histological and microbiological analysis) and treatment in 2 cases of TB lumbar spondylitis.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【7】Case 1. A 74-year-old woman with a history of gastric cancer presented with a chief complaint of lower back pain. Subjective lower back pain emerged approximately 4 months prior to her visit to our institute.  \nOn admission, deep tendon reflexes in both legs (patella tendon reflex (PTR) and Achilles tendon reflex (ATR)) were found to be decreased and hypoaesthesia was identified in the left L4 sensory region. Muscle weakness was observed in the left tibialis anterior muscle according to the manual muscle test (MMT), with a score of 4. Mild perianal hypoesthesia was observed. Neurologically, cauda equina syndrome and radiculopathy at and below the L4 level were identified.  \nRegarding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), T1-weighted imaging showed overall signal hypointensity for both L3 and L4 vertebral bodies, although T2-weighted imaging showed signal hyperintensity presumably indicating abundant abscess accumulation in the disc space, a lesion suspected to be epidural abscess in the spinal canal, and marked compression of the dural sac 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed multiple abscess formation around vertebral bodies with calcification inside 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. The preoperative diagnosis was infectious spondylitis (TB or pyogenic).  \nSurgery was started with the patient in the lateral position under local anaesthesia. According to the PN manoeuvre, percutaneous puncture was performed into the L3/4 intervertebral disc. A sheath was inserted into the disc space to aspirate 30 mL of abscess, and lower back pain reduced immediately thereafter. Curettage was performed while checking anteroposterior and lateral views on an X-ray image intensifier. Finally, an epidural tube as the in-tube and a drainage tube of 3 mm diameter as the out-tube were indwelled in the disc space and the operation was completed. Continuous irrigation was then started.  \nOn postoperative day 3, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected as Gaffky grade 2. M. tuberculosis infection was also confirmed by tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (TB-PCR). Irrigation was thus continued until postoperative day 16 using a washing solution of 200 mL saline containing 1000 mg streptomycin each day. Multidrug antituberculous therapy was started using pyramide (900 mg/d), isoniazid (300 mg/d), rifampicin (300 mg/d), and ethambutol (500 mg/d). Immediately after the completion of irrigation, the patient wore a lumbar brace and started rehabilitation of walking and muscle strength of the legs. Histology showed typical TB tissue with central caseous necrosis, surrounded by epithelioid cells and Langhans-type giant cells. Severe lower back pain also resolved almost completely by 1-2 weeks postoperatively.  \nMRI at 3 months postoperatively showed a clear tendency toward recovery of normal signal intensity in the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies on T1-weighted imaging, while most of the abscess with high signal intensity had disappeared from T2-weighted imaging. Good improvements were seen in both diagnostic imaging and clinical symptoms, with no tendency toward recurrence in blood biochemistry. All antituberculous agents were therefore discontinued at 7 months postoperatively. On MRI at 18 months postoperatively, signal intensity in vertebral bodies had completely recovered on T1-weighted imaging. No signal hyperintense regions were apparent in the disc space or epidurally to suggest abscess recurrence on T2-weighted imaging 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. In addition, plain radiography indicated complete bone union at 30 months postoperatively 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(d))</u>. At present, 7 years and 6 months after surgery, follow-up has shown good condition with no relapse of symptoms.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Preoperative MRI in Case 1: T2-weighted imaging.

A 64-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with lower back pain and a history of surgery for leg varicose veins. Lower back pain had emerged about 3.5 months prior to her visit to our institute, with gradual worsening. The patient complained that lower back pain had never improved since onset and had been exacerbated by even slight exercise such as standing and walking.  \nRegarding MRI, T1-weighted imaging showed overall signal hypointensity in both L2 and L3 vertebral bodies, whereas T2-weighted imaging showed signal hyperintensity presumably indicating abscess accumulation in the disc space extending to inside the L2 vertebral body. Subsequent gadolinium-enhanced imaging showed diffuse contrast in both L2 and L3 vertebral bodies and rim enhancement around the abscess in the right psoas muscle 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. CT showed a destructive change in the L2 vertebral endplate, and cavitations ≥10 mm in diameter were found in vertebral bodies 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. Preoperative diagnosis was infectious spondylitis (TB or pyogenic).  \nSurgery was performed similar to that described for Case 1. A sheath was inserted into the L2/3 disc space to allow curettage of infected disc tissue. Finally, a 3 mm diameter in-tube and a 5 mm diameter drainage tube as the out-tube were indwelled in the disc space and the operation was completed. Continuous irrigation was started.  \nHistology on postoperative day 9 showed epithelioid cells centred around caseous necrosis, and QuantiFERON TB-2G showed strongly positive results. TB spondylitis was therefore finally diagnosed. Irrigation was performed until postoperative day 12 using only 250 mL of saline each day. Multidrug antituberculous therapy was started using isoniazid (300 mg/d), rifampicin (450 mg/d) and ethambutol (750 mg/d). After completion of irrigation, the patient wore a lumbar brace and started rehabilitation, mainly for walking. Strong lower back pain also disappeared by about 1-2 weeks postoperatively.  \nMRI at 3 months postoperatively showed recovery to normal signal intensity from signal hypointensity in the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies, except for the cavity area on T1-weighted imaging. On T2-weighted imaging, part of the signal hyperintense area remained, but was restricted to the disc space and vertebral bodies, with disappearance of abscess in the right iliopsoas muscle 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. By 6 months postoperatively, diagnostic imaging showed good improvement, as did clinical symptoms. There was no evidence of recurrence from blood biochemistry. Administration of all antituberculous agents was thus discontinued at 6 months postoperatively. At 12 months, signal intensity in L2 and L3 vertebral bodies had normalized on T1-weighted imaging. No signal hyperintense regions were seen in the disc space, inside vertebral bodies or in the psoas muscle on T2-weighted imaging.  \nBy 6 months postoperatively, CT showed repair of the L2 vertebral body cavity and bone remodelling, and the cavities was clearly reduced. At 12 months postoperatively, the cavity was completely repaired and disappeared 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u>. At the time of writing, although complete bone union has not been achieved, follow-up shows good condition without relapse of symptoms at 24 months postoperatively.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | (a) Preoperative gadolinium imaging, axial image.

Discussion\n\n【12】TB spondylitis resistant to conservative therapy is treated surgically by focal dissection of sequestrum and abscess, followed by spinal reconstruction using bone graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As less biofilm formation by M. tuberculosis is seen around metal implants than by other pyogenic bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, surgical treatment in combination with spinal instrumentation is increasingly considered acceptable. Reported methods include support by posterior instrumentation after curettage of the anterior parts of vertebral bodies and bone graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and reconstruction using anterior instrumentation after curettage and bone graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A method to obtain strong stability has also been reported using not only bone graft but also a titanium cage for reconstruction of vertebral bodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. These methods have recently been applied to pyogenic spondylitis but are definitely highly invasive surgeries, either as 1- or 2-stage procedure.\n\n【13】Conversely, a method of percutaneous surgery for pyogenic spondylitis is available as an alternative to conservative treatment with antibiotic administration or open surgery. In 1990, Onik et al. reported 3 cases of automated percutaneous discectomy for the purpose of biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Yu et al. provided the first report of percutaneous discectomy in 2 cases of lumbar osteomyelitis using a nucleotome in 1991 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Nagata et al. later reported that good results were obtained through continuous irrigation with 2 indwelled tubes (an irrigation tube and drainage tube) in addition to percutaneous discectomy and local irrigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Other methods have also been reported to obtain good results, including external fixation in combination with percutaneous surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, secure local debridement using an endoscope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, and abscess drainage and continuous irrigation, even in cases with marked abscess and bone destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Most reports of percutaneous discectomy have involved continuous irrigation and drainage of pyogenic spondylodiscitis. No reports have described advanced TB spondylitis.\n\n【15】Dinc et al. performed CT-guided percutaneous drainage in 21 cases of TB psoas and spondylodiscitic abscess, with periods of drainage of up to 36 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However, 6 of these cases showed recurrence after removal of the drainage catheter. In a report of percutaneous discectomy in 16 cases of lumbar spondylodiscitis (including 1 case of TB), the primary objective was definitive diagnosis by focal biopsy. Three cases later required interbody fusion by open surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Surgical methods for TB spondylitis with marked abscess formation and bone destruction have been thought to require direct pus drainage, focal resection, and spinal reconstruction by bone graft. However, for patients with no advanced motor palsy before surgery, and no severe kyphotic deformity associated with vertebral body destruction or severe spinal instability, the method described herein can be expected to be effective not only for pyogenic spondylitis but also for TB spondylitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Sometimes, these abnormal anatomical features can lead to life-threatening presentations such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmia and even sudden death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery (AAORCA) describes the abnormal location of the orifice of the right coronary artery (RCA) in the left coronary sinus, an abnormality shown to carry a risk of myocardial infarction and sudden death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Such arteries can also develop atherosclerotic lesions. Although some studies have reported successful revascularization of these coronary abnormalities using surgical coronary bypass or percutaneous coronary angioplasty, the optimal revascularization strategy remains unclear. This report describes the case of a 75-year-old man with AAORCA and effort angina pectoris related to an atherosclerotic lesion in the RCA, which was successfully treated noninvasively using percutaneous coronary angioplasty.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】A 75-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to exertional dyspnea that had been manifesting for several months. The patient had coronary risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history of coronary disease, and past history of smoking, and was taking medication prescribed by his regular physician (nifedipine 20 mg/day for hypertension; bezafibrate 400 mg/day for hyperlipidemia). On admission, physical examination and laboratory data revealed no specific findings: white blood cell count, 3990 cells/μL; hemoglobin, 14.8 g/dL; platelets, 26.7 × 104 cells/μL; glucose, 95 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 14 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.71 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate, 81.7 mL/min; uric acid, 6.0 mg/dL; aspartate transaminase, 21 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 15 U/L; total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; creatine kinase, 85 IU/L; creatine kinase-MB, 8 IU/L; C-reactive protein, 0.1 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 150 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 63 mg/dL; triglycerides, 113 mg/dL; glycated hemoglobin, 5.4%; brain-type natriuretic peptide, 24 pg/mL. However, the exercise stress test revealed slight ST depression in leads V4-6 on electrocardiography. Based on the clinical symptoms, the patient was suspected of coronary artery disease. Adenosine triphosphate-stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging revealed inferolateral wall ischemia. Coronary computed tomography indicated that the RCA originated from the left coronary sinus and passed between the aorta and the pulmonary artery . Total occlusion in the midportion of the abnormal RCA and 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) were suspected. The RCA lesion had atherosclerotic findings such as spotty calcification and mild positive remodeling . The patient was diagnosed with effort angina pectoris and underwent coronary angiography, which revealed tight stenosis at the LAD-D1 bifurcation and a completely occluded RCA originating from the left coronary sinus. The abnormal RCA had multiple collaterals from the LAD and left circumflex branch . Because the patient had a coronary artery anomaly and multivessel stenosis, coronary artery bypass grafting was proposed for revascularization, but the patient refused any surgically invasive treatment. Therefore, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed for revascularization. The following revascularization systems were used: right femoral artery approach; guiding catheter, 7-Fr Amplatz Left 2 Mach 1 (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA); guide wire, Grand Slam, XT-R, and Sion blue (both from Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan); microcatheter, Mizuki (Kaneka Medical, Osaka, Japan) and Caravel (Asahi Intecc); balloon, Ikazuchi 1.0 × 10 mm (Kaneka Medical), Tazuna 2.0 × 15 mm (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and Raiden 3.5 × 10 mm (Kaneka Medical); stent, Ultimaster 3.0 × 18 mm (Terumo Corporation); and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheter, 40 MHz rotational OptiCross (Boston Scientific). Cannulating the guiding catheter to the anomalous orifice of the RCA was difficult, and it was not possible to achieve adequate backup support . Using the XT-R guide wire, the Mizuki microcatheter could not be passed though the chronic total occlusion lesion until it was replaced with a Caravel microcatheter. The wire was then changed to Sion blue . IVUS revealed diffuse eccentric calcified plaque. The intramural course of the proximal ectopic artery was elliptical with some lateral compression. However, the stenosis of the proximal intramural course was not so severe that we did not deploy the stent in the proximal portion . Multiple ballooning and angioplasty with a drug-eluting stent were performed , and an optimal result was obtained . At the same time, PCI was performed for LAD revascularization, and an optimal result was obtained . No exertional dyspnea was noted following PCI. At approximately one year after intervention, exercise stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging and coronary angiography revealed no in-stent restenosis or ischemia. The patient expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the intervention.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Coronary computed tomography revealing that the RCA originates from the left coronary sinus and passes between two great vessels.

Discussion\n\n【17】This case illustrates the possibility that coronary artery anomalies can be complicated with atherosclerotic lesions and can cause angina pectoris. PCI may represent a suitable option for the noninvasive treatment of such abnormal arteries.\n\nAAOCA represents a congenital coronary artery anomaly in which the artery originates from the contralateral aortic sinus. Thus, AAORCA describes the abnormal location of the RCA orifice in the left coronary sinus. The mortality rates associated with AAOCA have been reported at 0–50% for RCA abnormalities and 30–100% for left coronary artery abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The interarterial course of the RCA, which runs between the aorta and pulmonary artery (as in the present case), is considered malignant because it carries a risk of myocardial ischemia and sudden death even in the absence of atherosclerosis. Several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the mechanism by which such abnormalities cause ischemia in the absence of atherosclerosis: compression of the anomalous artery between the aorta and pulmonary artery (especially during exercise), compression of the anomalous artery by the aortic commissure, and angulation of the coronary artery origin with increased aortic wall tension or intramural course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. In contrast, some reports highlight the possibility that the proximal portion of the anomalous RCA could be more susceptible to atherosclerosis due to shear stress and vascular endothelium dysfunction caused by compression or by the anatomical feature itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Some reports of acute myocardial infarction with AAORCA indicated that the atherosclerotic culprit lesion was mostly seen at the proximal portion of the anomalous artery (75%). It is suspected that such anatomical abnormalities increase the risk of plaque formation and progression of atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. In patients with coronary anomaly, both atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic effects may lead to coronary disease. In the present case, coronary computed tomography and IVUS revealed the presence of an atherosclerotic lesion in the anomalous RCA. The IVUS findings also revealed the intramural course of the proximal ectopic artery was elliptical with some lateral compression. The severe stenosis of the intramural course of the proximal ectopic artery was recommended to deploy the stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However, in the present case, the stenosis of the proximal intramural course was not so severe that we did not deploy the stent in the proximal portion. The patient had no symptoms or signs of ischemia after PCI. The abnormal origin of the RCA may have promoted atherosclerosis development in this patient|.\n\n【19】Coronary revascularization is recommended as class I in patients with RCA originating anomalously and passing between the aorta and pulmonary artery, with evidence of myocardial ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the present case, the patient needed revascularization because the RCA ran between the aorta and pulmonary artery, with evidence of ischemia on stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. Coronary bypass surgery is usually selected for such coronary revascularization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 13, 14\\]</u>. However, an increasing number of reports have described the efficacy of PCI in such patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Because of the unusual anatomical features of anomalous coronary arteries, PCI may be technically challenging. Regarding the selection of the guiding catheter, if the ostium of the anomalous RCA is above the sinotubular junction, an AL-type guiding catheter is likely suitable for PCI. If the ostium of the anomalous RCA is below the sinotubular junction within the left sinus of valsalva, the anomalous RCA will present an acute takeoff angle of the orifice and the vessel course, which was also noted in our patient. Thus, guiding support is poor due to the noncoaxial engagement of most currently available guiding catheters. Successful revascularization in such patients requires adequate techniques such as the deep-seated guiding catheter technique, the buddy wire technique, the anchor balloon techniques, or using a large-caliber guiding catheter, an ST01™ catheter, or a GuideLiner™ catheter with the mother-and-child technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–19\\]</u>. Angelini et al. used dedicated guiding catheters and performed IVUS study successfully 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【20】This case illustrates the possibility that the anatomical features of coronary anomalies may promote atherosclerosis and cause angina pectoris, and that PCI may be used for the noninvasive revascularization of anomalous coronary arteries.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【22】Coronary artery anomalies can cause angina pectoris via both atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic effects. Percutaneous coronary angioplasty may be useful for the noninvasive revascularization of atherosclerotic lesions in abnormal coronary arteries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Tension pneumothorax is an uncommon presentation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) or COVID-19 pneumonia. We present a case of tension pneumothorax in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia and myocarditis. This was an unlikely diagnosis in a patient with no known underlying lung condition and no other precipitating factors such as barotrauma. In an acute deterioration of patients with SARS-CoV-2, it is important to always consider alternative diagnoses and repeat imaging.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. COVID-19 was reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 31<sup>st</sup> December 2019 and declared as a global pandemic on 11<sup>th</sup> March 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Presentations of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe illness or death. Multiple complications of COVID-19 including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, acute respiratory failure (ARF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, myocarditis, heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>, venous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>, secondary infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, pancreatic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and neurological complications such as seizures, meningitis, encephalitis, encephalopathy, ataxia, and neuralgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> have been reported in the literature thus far.\n\n【4】Pneumothorax is a common respiratory condition which is defined as the presence of air in the pleural cavity. Pneumothorax can be categorised by aetiology into spontaneous and traumatic, and spontaneous pneumothorax can be further characterised into primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients with no background of respiratory disease, and the pathophysiology is thought to be from asymptomatic blebs and bullae which disrupt due to shear force 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Secondary pneumothorax occurs in patients with underlying lung abnormality and diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, sarcoidosis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and connective tissue disorders. Many cases of traumatic pneumothorax are iatrogenic, and this complication has been reported in central vein cannulation, pleural tap or biopsy, transbronchial biopsy, fine needle aspiration, and acupuncture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Pulmonary barotrauma is another cause of iatrogenic pneumothorax occurring in patients being mechanically ventilated due to high inspiratory inflation pressures.\n\n【5】Tension pneumothorax develops when damaged tissue forms a one-way valve leading into the accumulation of air in the pleural space with inhalation. This results in rising volume of air and pressure in the affected hemithorax, leading to collapse of the affected lung and displacement of the mediastinum towards the contralateral side. This is a medical emergency, as the mediastinal shift exerts pressure on the contralateral lung and the vena cava, resulting in respiratory insufficiency, cardiovascular compromise, and death if untreated.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】We present the case of a 62-year-old gentleman, who was brought into the emergency department (ED) by ambulance with a history of dry cough, low grade fever, worsening shortness of breath for 4 days, and pleuritic sounding chest pain, which was different to when he had a pulmonary embolism approximately ten months ago. His past medical history included type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, treated malignant neoplasm of the base of tongue, diverticular disease, essential hypertension, and previous provoked pulmonary embolism. Before admission, he was living independently with his wife. His exercise tolerance was restricted to 10 yards with the assistance of a walking stick. He was an exsmoker and used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day but stopped smoking a few years previously.\n\n【8】On admission, he was pyrexial with a temperature of 38.2°C, oxygen saturations 98% on 28% FiO<sub>2</sub>, blood pressure 73/35 mmHg, and pulse rate 92 bpm. Initial treatment included oxygen 28% FiO<sub>2</sub> via a venturi mask and fluid resuscitation for hypotension. Physical examination revealed bibasal crepitations on auscultation of chest and a swollen and tender right leg. Initial investigations revealed deranged biochemical markers  and opacification affecting the right midzone of the lung .\n\n【9】Table 1 Blood results.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest radiograph on admission demonstrating right midzone consolidation.</u>\n\n【11】Initial laboratory workup summarised in Table 1.\n\n【12】In view of the clinical presentation and raised d-dimer, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed which reported right upper lobe consolidation with subtle peripheral ground glass opacification in the left upper lobe and both lower lobes, suggestive of early COVID-19 infection . Moreover, his troponin I levels were markedly elevated and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment depression and T-wave inversion in the anterolateral chest leads. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function with an akinetic and rounded apical septal wall.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CT pulmonary angiogram report: there are no pulmonary emboli and pleural or pericardial effusions. There is consolidation within the right upper lobe with subtle peripheral ground glass opacification noted in the left upper lobe and in both lower lobes. Appearances are indeterminate but could represent early COVID-19 disease. The central and peripheral airways are patent with no lower cervical, axillary, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lung mass. Other viscera are unremarkable.</u>\n\n【14】On account of the history, examination, and investigations, he was treated as suspected COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia (CURB-65 score = 2, moderate severity), COVID-19 myocarditis, and sepsis, leading to multiorgan failure. In view of poor physiological reserve and comorbidities, the ceiling of care was decided to be ward level care and noninvasive ventilation if needed. However, he began to improve clinically, became normotensive, and was able to be weaned off oxygen day 3 after admission. By that time, his swab detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\n【15】Following initial improvement, he suddenly developed a new, increased oxygen demand, requiring titration of humidified oxygen up to 10 litres. Chest physiotherapy helped him bring up copious volumes of thick sputum, and he was stable for most of the day with oxygen saturations of 93%. Later that day, he suddenly deteriorated and becoming cyanotic and critically unwell. Oxygen saturations were 80% on 15 litres nonrebreathe mask, and he was significantly tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 40/minute. An urgent portable chest X-ray revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax causing mediastinal shift .\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Portable chest radiograph following acute deterioration, demonstrating a right-sided tension pneumothorax.</u>\n\n【17】An intercostal drain was inserted on an emergency basis and the patient improved slightly over the next 24 hours though he still required oxygen via a high flow nasal cannula system to maintain oxygen saturations of 92% or more. Despite the chest drain and the addition of thoracic suction, the lung did not reexpand. He continued to deteriorate rapidly, was unable to tolerate further pleural procedures, and died.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Here, we present a case of spontaneous tension pneumothorax in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia and myocarditis. Although our patient did not have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease before the admission, review of his CTPA images revealed minimal emphysematous changes in the right lung which could have ruptured by the added insult of COVID-19 pneumonia. This could have led to an air leak into the hemithorax, resulting in a spontaneous tension pneumothorax.\n\n【20】COVID-19 is a newly described disease with limited and ever-expanding knowledge of its clinical manifestations. Multiple causes of acute clinical deterioration have been already described, including ARDS and pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This case report aims to highlight the importance of urgent chest X-ray and prompt clinical examination in patients with COVID-19 that develop a sudden increase in oxygen requirements and become acutely tachypnoeic in order to rule out the possibility of pneumothorax. In view of the lack of a formal diagnosis of previous lung disease, this situation could have been misinterpreted as progression of ARDS in the current climate. This could have resulted in further deterioration of the patient if CPAP had been introduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Furthermore, chest physiotherapy is contraindicated in untreated tension pneumothorax, and depending on the time frame of pneumothorax development, may have had a negative effect on the clinical course of this patient.\n\n【21】Two recent case reports have been published regarding the link between COVID-19 and spontaneous pneumothorax; however, the absence of published literature of such cases could result in clinicians missing these diagnoses; hence, we present this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】In summary, our case demonstrates spontaneous tension pneumothorax as a rare but serious complication of COVID-19. Meticulous physical examination and repeat sequential chest X-rays can be useful tools in the diagnosis of complications and management of disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Materials and Methods. Case report followed by a retrospective review of 1000 MR imaging studies of the foot for the presence or absence of a bipartite medial cuneiform. Results. The incidence of the bipartite medial cuneiform is 0.1%. Conclusion. A bipartite medial cuneiform is a rare finding but one with both clinical and surgical implications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The bipartite medial cuneiform is a rare tarsal developmental variant at the Lisfranc joint that was first described in 1942 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Prior case reports have described how this rare anomaly could impact clinical care, either as a source of unexplained chronic midfoot pain or as a potential for misdiagnosis as a fracture in the setting of midfoot trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We present a case report of a Lisfranc fracture in a patient with a bipartite medial cuneiform, an association that has not yet been described in the literature. Our case furthered exemplifies how knowledge of the bipartite medial cuneiform plays a role in both conservative and surgical treatment. Additionally, as we have encountered this anomaly only very rarely, we sought to determine the prevalence of the bipartite medial cuneiform with a retrospective review of 1,000 consecutive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Materials/Method\n\n【6】The clinical and imaging findings of a patient with a Lisfranc fracture with a bipartite medial cuneiform were reviewed. This case led to a retrospective, cross-sectional, observation study that was approved by the Institutional Review Board with waiver of informed consent. One thousand MR imaging scans of the foot that were performed at our institution from January of 2007 to February of 2013 were reviewed. The typical MR imaging protocol included axial T1, axial proton density (fat sat), sagittal T1, sagittal T2 fast spin echo (fat sat), coronal T1, coronal T2 fast spin echo (fat sat) and coronal proton density (fat sat) sequences. Patients were selected on the basis of availability of MR imaging scans for review. Exclusion criteria were lack of available images (off-site storage) or artifacts due to excessive motion or metal. The findings in the case report were reviewed in consensus by a radiology resident (Geraldine Chang) and fellowship trained musculoskeletal radiologist (Eric Y. Chang, two years of experience) and thereafter the remainder of the MR images in the retrospective review were reviewed by the radiology resident (Geraldine Chang). Age and biological sex were also recorded.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【8】##### 3.1. Case Report\n\n【9】A 31-year-old man presented to the emergency department after a skateboarding accident. The patient stated that he twisted his left foot and struck the dorsum of the foot against a curb. Pain was localized to his midfoot and worsened with weight bearing. Patient also reported a feeling of foot instability.\n\n【10】Physical examination revealed ecchymosis and edema on the dorsum of the left foot. There was extreme tenderness throughout the Lisfranc articulation, but mostly in the region of the first and second rays. Overall, alignment of the foot was within normal limits. Range of motion of the ankle was preserved. Motor strength was decreased secondary to discomfort. Intact sensation and brisk capillary refill were also noted.\n\n【11】Radiographs, computed tomography (CT) images, and MR images 通用删除1(英):<u>(refer to Figures 1 and 2)</u> revealed a Lisfranc injury in the setting of a bipartite medial cuneiform. MR images demonstrated the attachment site of the plantar Lisfranc ligament to the plantar segment of the medial cuneiform and the attachment site of the Lisfranc ligament proper and dorsal Lisfranc ligament to the dorsal segment of the medial cuneiform. Orthopedic consultation was obtained and patient underwent operative exploration, which demonstrated a dislocation of the first and second tarsometatarsal joints and a comminuted fracture of the medial and intermediate cuneiforms. Patient underwent open treatment with internal fixation.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Axial CT images at the level of the midfoot show a Lisfranc fracture of the medial cuneiform.

Subjects’ age ranged from 17 to 92 years with a mean age of 45 years. There were 803 male and 197 female subjects. There was a 0.1% incidence of the bipartite medial cuneiform based on our review of 1000 MR imaging studies of the ankle.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【16】The bipartite medial cuneiform is a rare tarsal developmental variant at the Lisfranc joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Differentiating this osseous variation from a fracture is important to both clinicians and radiologists. In addition, the bipartite medial cuneiform can be a potential source for nontraumatic or traumatic midfoot pain, and knowledge of this entity can play a role in both conservative and surgical treatment. A previous anthropologic population study in 1942 found this anomaly to occur in approximately 0.3% of persons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A case series and literature review by Elias et al. described the MR imaging features of the bipartite medial cuneiform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. To our knowledge, however, our case report is the first to show a Lisfranc fracture in the setting of a bipartite medial cuneiform. These findings prompted a retrospective review to determine the frequency of the bipartite medial cuneiform based on MR imaging.\n\n【17】The bipartition of the medial cuneiform is a malsegmentation defect of the foot characterized by separation of the normal cuneiform into dorsal and plantar segments due to the presence of two primary ossification centers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 6–9\\]</u>. It is the failure of fusion of these two ossicles that results in a bipartite medial configuration. The ossification process in this bone begins in the second to third year of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7–9\\]</u>. In many cases, these segments are held together by means of a cartilaginous or fibrocartilaginous bridge.\n\n【18】In this anomaly, the cuneiform bone is divided horizontally by a synchondrosis, partitioning the medial cuneiform into plantar and dorsal segments. The plantar ossicle is typically larger than the dorsal ossicle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The tibialis anterior tendon attaches to the proximal superomedial aspect of the dorsal segment. The posterior tibialis tendon attaches to the distal inferolateral portion of the plantar segment. The peroneus longus tendon attaches to the proximal inferomedial and distal inferolateral portions of the plantar segment. The Lisfranc ligament proper (interosseous portion) and the dorsal Lisfranc ligament extend from the dorsal segment of the bipartite medial cuneiform to insert into the base of the second metatarsal. The plantar Lisfranc ligament extends from the plantar segment of the bipartite medial cuneiform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Based on our review of the literature, the bipartite medial cuneiform is generally an incidental finding but one that rarely can be symptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 10\\]</u>. Chiodo et al. reported a patient who failed conservative treatment, demonstrating that surgical excision may be indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore, it is important for radiologists and clinicians to keep bipartition of the bone in mind when evaluating acute or chronic midfoot pain.\n\n【20】In the setting of trauma, it is important to differentiate a bipartite medial cuneiform from a fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The bipartite articulation is best visualized on a 30-degree external oblique radiograph of the foot. The site of partition should demonstrate smooth, well corticated margins, and the two portions of the bipartite cuneiform together are larger than the expected normal or fractured medial cuneiform. In addition, all cases of a bipartite medial cuneiform demonstrate bipartition along the long axis of the foot, and this orientation is uncommon for a fracture. Furthermore, with MR imaging, an asymptomatic bipartite medial cuneiform should not have been associated with bone marrow edema. Due to the well-defined joint space between the base of the first metatarsal and the distal portion of the medial bipartite cuneiform as well as between the two bipartite portions, a “E” joint space configuration is demonstrated on MR imaging in the sagittal plane, the so-called E-sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【21】We are the first to report a Lisfranc fracture in the setting of this anomaly. Our patient had both CT and MR imaging. The Lisfranc ligament proper and the plantar Lisfranc ligament attached to different portions of the bipartitioned bone. In our case, both ossicles were fractured and the patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation.\n\n【22】To our knowledge, our series is the only one to date dealing with the frequency of the bipartite medial cuneiform in persons undergoing MR imaging. In our retrospective review of 1000 patients, we found a 0.1% incidence, which is lower than that reported in anthropological studies.\n\n【23】There are limitations to our study. Our subjects included an uneven distribution of male and female subjects. In addition, the age range of our subject population was 17–92 with the exclusion of the pediatric population. Further studies that include a more diverse patient population with more female and pediatric subjects are required to validate our findings. However, the reported incidence in the literature of a bipartite medial cuneiform bone has ranged from 0.3% to 2.4% in cadaveric studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our study confirms that the bipartite medial cuneiform is, in fact, very rare.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9bc31175-16a6-49f8-98c1-d9ab5a698d4b", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Pseudothrombocytopenia (PTCP) is an in vitro phenomenon of low platelet count caused by the agglutination of platelets, leading to false low platelet counts in automated cell counting. Typically, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) mediates this platelet clumping. PTCP has little clinical significance, but misdiagnosis may lead to unnecessary diagnostic tests and treatment. In this case report, we present a 65-year-old Caucasian female suffering from multiple complications during and after cardiac surgery. During her postoperative stay at the ICU, she was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia and an inadequate response to platelet supplementation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 65-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the General Hospital of Vienna with the diagnosis of a combined high-grade mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency, persisting atrial fibrillation, and a hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Surgical reconstruction of the mitral and tricuspid valve, as well as a left atrial appendage (LAA) resection, was indicated and performed. An intraoperative rupture of the left atrium led to two periods of cardiopulmonary bypass and the consecutive implantation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to impaired right ventricular function. After the surgical procedure, the patient was transferred to the ICU, where she required high doses of catecholamine support and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) due to acute renal failure. On postoperative day (POD) 7, ECMO weaning was successful, and the therapy was finally stopped. Initially, anticoagulation therapy consisted of unfractionated heparin and was switched to low-molecular-weight heparin after ECMO explantation. On POD 8, a complete blood count (CBC) showed a reduced platelet count of 39 G/L . 4Ts score for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was 5, which represented an intermediate probability of HIT. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIT was negative (Zymutest HIA IgG, Hyphen Biomed, Neuville sur Oise, France), and a viscoelastic test of a whole blood sample (rotational thromboelastometry, ROTEM) showed no abnormalities, moreover, a procoagulant state despite the low numeric platelet count . Physical examination did not reveal any signs of hemorrhagic diathesis. Platelet count could not be significantly increased by the transfusion of two units of platelet concentrates. The platelet count after the first transfusion was 28 G/L, and the platelet count after the second transfusion on the following day was 24 G/L. On POD 10, CBC was reevaluated by using sodium citrate tubes instead of EDTA tubes, revealing a platelet count of 216 G/L . Since PTCP was diagnosed two days after the first low platelet count and the patient was critically ill and on continuous ECMO therapy, other causes of thrombocytopenia such as immune thrombocytopenia were not evaluated further. During the patient’s stay at our ICU, platelet count was also checked with a specific blood collection tube (ThromboExact, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) confirming the results collected with the citrated blood tubes.\n\n【4】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Postoperative platelet count with different blood collection tubes (EDTA, Sodium Citrate, Magensium sulfate) as shown.</u>\n\n【5】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) showing a procoagulant state despite the low numeric platelet count.</u>\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【7】Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count lower than 150 G/L. A platelet count lower than 100 G/L is considered to imply medium to high bleeding risk, depending on the particular platelet count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The diagnosis of thrombocytopenia usually includes a repetition of the complete blood count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>, the white blood cell differential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, a peripheral blood smear, and the evaluation of possible hematological abnormalities. If none of these tests are indicative for a genuine thrombocytopenia or a malignant hematological disease, PTCP can be the cause for low platelet count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【8】PTCP is an analytical error in automated blood cell counting. Blood samples which contain autoantibodies against thrombocytes and are collected in EDTA-containing tubes can lead to platelet clumping. Agglutinated platelets are detected as larger cells by using automated counters and lead to false low results. This phenomenon was discovered early after the invention of laboratory medicine automation and was described precisely soon after 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【9】The incidence of severe thrombocytopenia (<100 G/L) among the population of critically ill patients is 7.8% and therefore a very likely diagnosis. This could mislead clinicians in cases of PTCP and result in overtreatment with the administration of platelet concentrates or even more invasive procedures such as splenectomy. Other rare causes of thrombocytopenia such as HIT were found to be 0.3% in this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, whereas the incidence of PTCP is suggested to range from 0.09 to 0.15% in routine clinical blood samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Unfortunately, data of PTCP in a critically ill population are lacking, but given the data, one can assume that the likelihood of other more clinically relevant causes of thrombocytopenia, even if it is still very small (HIT 0.3%), is higher than to suffer from PTCP. Therefore, clinicians are concerned with the diagnostics of the more severe forms of thrombocytopenia and are not aware about analytical errors since the repetition of the specimen often confirms the result.\n\n【10】As mentioned above, PTCP is induced by the cross-reaction of EDTA and platelet autoantibodies which cause the agglutination of platelets in the sample 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This phenomenon is not only restricted to EDTA but also present with other anticoagulants such as sodium oxalate, sodium citrate, and heparin, making it more difficult to diagnose PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Recently, there are increasing numbers of reports portraying this multi-anticoagulant PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. Additives mixed with EDTA specimens, i.e. aminoglycosides such as kanamycin and amikacin, can prevent the agglutination of platelets and dissociate platelet clumps if added after blood withdrawal and could therefore be a helping agent in diagnostics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. Unfortunately, there have been reports on the unreliability of these effects in certain cases of PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Another possible solution of the problem could be the utilization of magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) as an anticoagulant. Before laboratory medicine automation, MgSO<sub>4</sub> was widely used to prevent blood cell agglutination but was replaced by EDTA after the invention of automated cell counting because of the more convenient use as spray-dried coat in blood collection tubes. It is now suggested to reconsider MgSO<sub>4</sub> as an anticoagulant in diagnostics of multiple-anticoagulant PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. By now, blood collection tubes containing MgSO<sub>4</sub> as an anticoagulant additive are available commercially (ThromboExact, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) and were used in this presented case to confirm the results, which were collected in citrated blood tubes.\n\n【11】The induction of autoantibodies reacting with EDTA and platelets is not resolved but very likely induced over a period of medical treatment. An early work on the patient population (18 patients) presenting with PTCP found that, at hospital admission, 61% of all patients had a platelet count over 100 G/L, which then deteriorated over their hospital stay. Furthermore, they found that 55% of the study population were treated at an intensive care unit, 22% suffered from neoplastic diseases, and another 22% suffered from atherosclerosis-related conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. However, newer investigations could not reveal a correlation between these clinical characteristics and the development of PTCP, except for receiving medical treatment within a short period of time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The assumption of antibodies being the cause of this phenomenon was communicated early after the introduction of PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The detection of specific antibodies took place in the mid-90s. Platelet agglutination is induced by a variety of immunoglobulins including IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies, which bind to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the platelet surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【13】There are growing numbers of reported PTCP caused by a variety of therapies and diseases. In some cases, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors seems to be responsible for PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>, as well as direct glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists such as abciximab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Furthermore, there have been reports on PTCP in COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. It seems that multiple medical treatments, diseases, and infections can induce PTCP.\n\n【14】It is therefore important to raise awareness throughout the clinical and scientific societies to consider PTCP as differential diagnosis early after the onset of low platelet counts without clinical symptoms of hemorrhagic diathesis. With cases of multi-anticoagulant PTCP, it is getting more difficult to detect false low platelet counts, and appropriate diagnostic facilities (peripheral blood smear, ThromboExact blood tubes) need to be available for correct diagnosis. Considering these challenges, it can be difficult in clinical settings to thoroughly evaluate causes of thrombocytopenia, but one should consequently pursue the process of finding the right diagnosis since the clinical consequences of overtreatment can be dramatic, i.e. splenectomy. In this case report, the challenge of finding the right diagnosis was the complexity of the case. Thrombocytopenia is not uncommon after cardiac surgery and on ECMO therapy. A bleeding tendency is often present because of deranged coagulation factors and mass transfusions. Since our department is very skilled and trained in the management and diagnosis of bleeding disorders, our patient was diagnosed with PTCP shortly after the onset of severe thrombocytopenia (two days after first severe low platelet counts). Further invasive treatment could be averted from the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b9dbd999-79be-4e90-b062-e7fc488d0443", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are common autoimmune inflammatory conditions, often existing as comorbidities that have a significant impact on a patient’s quality of life. The availability of a range of novel, targeted therapies for their treatment, most notably the availability of biologic agents, has revolutionised management of these conditions and allowed for significant improvements in patient outcomes. Secukinumab (Cosentyx), a fully-human monoclonal antibody that acts by selectively binding to and neutralising the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A, is used widely for the treatment of both chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. In this report, we discuss the case of a 54-year-old female with chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, who experienced the onset of symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with Crohn’s disease during treatment with secukinumab. It was determined by the gastroenterologist that this may represent secukinumab-induced inflammatory bowel disease. We will review the current understanding of the role of IL-17 in inflammatory bowel disease and the important role of novel agents that target the p19 subunit of IL-23 which have shown significant promise in the management of not only chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but also inflammatory bowel disease itself.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Chronic plaque psoriasis is a common, autoimmune condition of the skin, affecting 1-2% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Psoriatic arthritis, an inflammatory and potentially destructive condition of the joints, has a population prevalence of 1% and is seen in up to 30% of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, most commonly associated with the presence of psoriatic nail disease or psoriasis of the scalp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. These conditions, particularly when experienced together, have a significant impact on patients’ quality of life and often present a significant challenge to manage successfully with conventional therapies alone. The availability of a range of new, targeted therapies for their treatment, most notably the availability of biologic agents, has revolutionised the treatment of both of these conditions.\n\n【4】Secukinumab (Cosentyx), a fully-human monoclonal antibody that acts by selectively binding and neutralising the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A, is widely used for the treatment of both chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with FDA approval for the use in moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis received in 2015. Despite the important role of agents that target the action of IL-17 in a number of autoimmune inflammatory conditions, their use in inflammatory bowel disease has not been successful, with a number of studies and case reports suggesting that not only is inhibition of IL-17 ineffective for management of Crohn’s disease but also that their use may induce or exacerbate the condition.\n\n【5】In this report, we will discuss the case of a 54-year-old female treated with secukinumab for chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who experienced new onset of symptoms and a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease subsequent to treatment with the agent.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【7】A 54-year-old female with chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis presented with a one-month history of diarrhoea, passing at least five loose motions each day with accompanying urgency, abdominal discomfort, tenesmus, and weight loss of 4 kg. There was no known precipitant and no history of fevers, recent travel, dietary change, or sick contacts. She had no personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, though she had a sister with ulcerative colitis. She was a current smoker and had ceased use of NSAIDs at the onset of symptoms.\n\n【8】Examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed an elevated faecal calprotectin of 612 μg/g (normal: <50 μg/g). Inflammatory markers were mildly elevated with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 12 mm/hr and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 26 mg/L. Full blood count, chemistry panel, and iron studies were unremarkable. Faecal microscopy and culture including assessment for ova, cysts, and parasites and multiplex PCR for major enteric pathogens were negative. Serum testing for Strongyloides antibodies was negative. The patient reported a single positive faecal occult blood test that had been performed by her general practitioner.\n\n【9】Given these findings and the patient’s ongoing symptoms, she was referred for urgent colonoscopy. This revealed mild-to-moderate patchy ileal inflammation with ulcers, with a normal colon. The impression of the reporting gastroenterologist was that this was consistent with Crohn’s disease, possibly induced by secukinumab, and suggested consideration of cessation of the drug.\n\n【10】The patient had been commenced on secukinumab by her rheumatologist fourteen months prior to the onset of symptoms as management for both psoriatic arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis. She had previously taken methotrexate which was ceased approximately two months after commencing the biologic agent.\n\n【11】Secukinumab was subsequently ceased, and she remained off a biologic agent for two months until worsening of both her chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis necessitated treatment. During this two-month period, her bowel symptoms improved markedly. The decision was made to commence on a biologic agent targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23 and to avoid the use of another agent targeting IL-17, given the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【12】She was commenced on tildrakizumab (Ilumya), a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23, and noted significant improvement in not only her chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but also complete resolution of her symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease and normalisation of her inflammatory markers. She has remained on this agent for nine-months to date and has reported no adverse events.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are common immune-mediated conditions, both of which result in significant impairment of a patient’s quality of life. Chronic plaque psoriasis is a common inflammatory condition of the skin, affecting 1-2% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is characterised by the presence of erythematous, thickened, scaly plaques most commonly of the flexor surfaces of the elbows and knees, but may also be seen in the scalp, groin, nails, or palmoplantar surfaces. With a population prevalence of 1%, psoriatic arthritis is characterised by the presence of peripheral and axial arthritis, dactylitis, and enthesitis and is present in up to 30% of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, most commonly in those with nail psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The development of targeted biologic therapies for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis has revolutionised clinical practice and provided significant improvements to the quality of life of those who suffer from them when compared to treatment with conventional therapies.\n\n【15】##### 3.1. Psoriasis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease\n\n【16】Patients with psoriasis are at a significantly higher risk of experiencing at least one other immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) when compared to the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A study of 10,923 patients assessed the rates of IMIDs in patients with psoriasis and compared this to 109,230 general population controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. They reviewed the rates of these conditions before and after psoriasis was diagnosed. They reported that 20% of patients with psoriasis had at least one IMID prior to diagnosis, and 14.7% were found to have an IMID after diagnosis, representing a five-fold increased risk of IMIDs compared to general population controls. Crohn’s disease was identified in 1% of patients prior to diagnosis of psoriasis and in 0.2% after diagnosis. Ulcerative colitis was identified in 0.8% of patients prior to diagnosis of psoriasis and in 0.3% after diagnosis. This data suggests that not only will a significant proportion of patients experience comorbid psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease but also that it is more common for the inflammatory bowel disease to be present at the onset of psoriatic symptoms than for it to develop after a diagnosis of psoriasis.\n\n【17】The association between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease is well established and was first reported in 1968, with an epidemiological study suggesting a higher prevalence of psoriasis in first-degree relatives of patients with Crohn’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. More recently, a Swiss cohort study of 950 patients published in 2011 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, which included 580 patients with Crohn’s disease and 370 patients with ulcerative colitis, assessed the frequency of extraintestinal manifestations. 2% of the patients with Crohn’s disease also suffered from psoriasis, and 1% of the patients with ulcerative colitis were also diagnosed with psoriasis. A Danish population study of 5,554,100 individuals published in 2016 investigated the association between Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis in patients with psoriasis over a period from 1997 to 2012 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The lifetime prevalence of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis in this population was higher in those diagnosed with psoriasis, with 0.65% of individuals with psoriasis developing Crohn’s disease, compared to 0.35% of the general population, and 1.41% of individuals diagnosed with psoriasis developing ulcerative colitis, compared to 0.81% of the general population. The mean time to diagnosis from the onset of psoriasis was 3.9 years for Crohn’s disease and 4.3 years for ulcerative colitis. It is important to note that the study excluded patients with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or psoriasis prior to the start of the study period, so it did not discuss the rates of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease prior to diagnosis of psoriasis.\n\n【18】Like psoriasis, rates of inflammatory bowel disease are higher in family members of those diagnosed with the condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A Danish population study published in 2015 assessed familial risk for inflammatory bowel disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. They reported that up to 12% of patients with Crohn’s disease and 9% of patients with ulcerative colitis had a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. Their results showed an eight-fold increase in the risk of Crohn’s disease in first-degree relatives of those with Crohn’s disease and a four-fold increase in ulcerative colitis in first-degree relatives of those with ulcerative colitis when compared to families with no history of inflammatory bowel disease. This risk was also increased in second- and third-degree relatives, though to a lesser extent. They also noted that a history of a family member with ulcerative colitis corresponded to an increased risk of a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease and vice versa.\n\n【19】From this, it is clear that taking comprehensive history, including assessment of the personal and family history of inflammatory bowel disease, and other IMIDs, is of great importance and should help to guide the selection of the most appropriate management options for patients with psoriasis.\n\n【20】##### 3.2. IL-17 Induced Inflammatory Bowel Disease–What is the Evidence?\n\n【21】Secukinumab is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that acts by selectively binding and neutralising the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. IL-17 is known to play a central role in the pathophysiology underpinning a number of immune-mediated conditions including chronic plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and ankylosing spondylitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, and as such, secukinumab has been investigated and utilised extensively for range of these conditions.\n\n【22】In its phase 3 trial for chronic plaque psoriasis “ERASURE,” which compared the safety and efficacy of secukinumab delivered by subcutaneous injection at doses of 300 mg and 150 mg to placebo, the percentage of participants who demonstrated a 75% reduction in their Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) at week 12 was 81.6% for 300 mg and 71.6% for 150 mg, compared to 4.5% of patients randomised to placebo, and the percentage of patients achieving an Investigator Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) was 65.3% for 300 mg, 51.2% for 150 mg, and 2.4% in the placebo group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Further to this, secukinumab showed superior efficacy to both entanercept, a fusion protein targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, in the phase 3 FIXTURE and CLEAR clinical trials, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The FUTURE 1 and FUTURE 2 trials investigated the efficacy of secukinumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis, with both phase 3 trials reporting statistically significant improvements in a number of domains including signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis, numbers of joints actively involved, function, radiographic disease progression, and in patient and physician global assessments in those treated with secukinumab at doses of 300 mg and 150 mg versus placebo, with the response to 75 mg of secukinumab not significantly different to placebo in the FUTURE 2 trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【24】As a class, agents that target IL-17 have shown significant promise for a range of autoimmune inflammatory conditions. Other agents in this class include ixekizumab (Taltz), a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17A, brodalumab (Siliq), a human monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-17 receptor A, and bimekizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17A and IL-17F which is in phase 3 clinical trials at the time of publication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The role of agents that target IL-17 in the management of inflammatory bowel disease remains controversial. A number of case reports describing new-onset Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis in those treated with secukinumab have been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–17\\]</u>, and a phase II proof-of-concept trial to assess the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in 59 patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease revealed that it was not only ineffective, with 15.4% of patients assigned to active treatment experiencing worsening of symptoms, but also that there was an increased rate of adverse events and serious adverse events in the treatment group when compared to placebo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【26】A review article by Schreiber et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> investigated the incidence rates of inflammatory bowel disease in patients enrolled on 21 clinical trials of secukinumab for the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, with a pooled analysis of 7355 patients and a cumulative exposure time of 16,226.9 patient-years. For these 7355 patients, they report 41 cases of inflammatory bowel disease. In the studies specific to psoriasis, there were 5 cases of Crohn’s disease, 14 cases of ulcerative colitis, and 1 “unclassified” case, with 14 of these representing new onset of disease. In the studies specific to psoriatic arthritis, they report three cases each of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis and two “unclassified” cases, with seven of these representing new onset disease. The analyses for ankylosing spondylitis revealed eight cases of Crohn’s disease, four cases of ulcerative colitis, and one “unclassified” case with nine representing new onset of disease. For comparison, among the placebo groups, there was one case each of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis in the 2877 patients randomised to placebo in studies for psoriasis, two cases of Crohn’s disease, and one of ulcerative colitis in the 394 patients randomised to placebo in studies for ankylosing spondylitis and none in the 703 patients randomised to placebo in studies for psoriatic arthritis. The occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease has also been described for both ixekizumab and brodalumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease is complex and multifactorial and is thought to result from abnormal immune responses to microorganisms of the intestinal flora secondary to environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. The exact mechanism by which agents that target IL-17 promote the development or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease and, indeed, the role of IL-17 in inflammatory bowel disease remains poorly defined, though numerous theories exist.\n\n【28】A study by Maxwell et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> used an Abcb1a<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model of colitis to investigate the roles of IL-17A and IL-17RA. They noted exacerbation of colitis secondary to inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17RA which appeared to be facilitated by a number of factors. They noted a reduction in neutrophil aggregation with IL-17 inhibition, thought to be secondary to inhibition of IL-17A-induced production of chemokines which function as neutrophil chemoattractants. This lack of neutrophil aggregation was significant, as it was thought to allow increased bacterial invasion and dispersal. They also reported increased production of INF-y<sup>+</sup>IL-17<sup>+</sup> double positive effector cells, which was again significant as it may lead to predominance of effector T-cells over regulatory T-cells, exacerbating underlying inflammation. They noted an increase in intestinal permeability in IL-17RA inhibition and breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Finally, they also reported that IL-17RA inhibition led to a reduction in the expression of gut antimicrobial peptides, facilitating enhanced microbial persistence and invasion. IL-17 is also known to play an essential role in immunity against yeast, with studies suggesting that overgrowth of Candida albicans secondary to IL-17 blockade may trigger or worsen inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【29】##### 3.3. The Role of Novel Biologic Agents Targeting the p19 Subunit of IL-23\n\n【30】The use of agents targeting TNF has revolutionised the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease over the past 15 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Despite this, approximately one-third of patients with Crohn’s disease are classed as primary nonresponders to them, and in up to a further 40% of patients, efficacy is lost over time as a result of development of immunogenicity, rapid clearance of the drug, or due to development of adverse events necessitating cessation of the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. This highlighted the requirement for development of more effective therapies for the condition. Agents that target IL-23, either via the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 or more selective agents targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23, have shown promise for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, and similarly, a number of these agents have shown significant benefits or remain under investigation for their role in treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n\n【31】Ustekinumab, a monoclonal IgG1 antibody targeting the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, is approved for use in the treatment of moderate-to-severely active Crohn’s disease with its efficacy demonstrated in the UNITI-1, UNITI-2, and IM-UNITI studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Though its safety profile has been characterised extensively through its trials in psoriasis, there have been notable concerns regarding the potential for malignancy and reduction in host immune defences against pathogens by blocking IL-12-mediated Th1 responses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>, and the utility of blockade of IL-12 in the management of Crohn’s disease is disputed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Agents currently under investigation for management of Crohn’s disease that selectively target the p19 subunit of IL-23 include brazikumab, guselkumab, mirikizumab, risankizumab, and tildrakizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【33】The phase 2a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of brazikumab (known as MEDI2070) in 119 adult patients with moderate-to-severely active Crohn’s disease who had failed treatment with agents targeting TNF showed promising results, with 49.2% of patients randomised to MEDI2070 reaching the primary end-point (a 100-point decrease in Crohn’s disease activity scores or clinical remission as defined by a Crohn’s disease activity score of less than 150) at week eight, compared to 26.7% of patients receiving placebo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. At week 24, clinical response was achieved in 53.8% of patients who continued on open label MEDI2070 and in 57.7% of patients who had initially received placebo and, then, subsequently received open label MEDI2070 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Phase 2 studies of risankizumab showed similar promise. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study of 121 adult patients, 93% of whom had been treated with an agent targeting TNF previously and 79% of which had failed treatment with that agent, was conducted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Patients received intravenous (IV) risankizumab at a dose of 200 mg or 600 mg, or placebo, at weeks 0 and 4, and 8. 31% of patients randomised to risankizumab at either dose achieved the primary end point (Crohn’s disease activity score of less than 150), compared to 15% in the placebo arm. 24% of patients randomised to the 200 mg arm and 37% of patients randomised to 600 mg risankizumab arm achieved clinical remission. Rates of adverse events were similar between the groups, and there was a higher rate of serious adverse events in the placebo group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【35】An open label extension was performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>, where patients who failed to achieve “deep remission” (Crohn’s disease activity score of less than 150) or endoscopic remission, received open-label IV risankizumab at a dose of 600 mg every four weeks, and those who had achieved remission were “washed out” from the medication for 12 weeks, unless they met the criteria for a “flare” of their disease in this time. Patients remaining in clinical remission at week 26 were then randomised to the “maintenance dosing regimen” of 180 mg by subcutaneous injection every 8 weeks for 26 weeks. They reported an increase in rates of clinical remission in all treatment groups at week 26, with 55% of patients initially randomised to placebo achieving clinical remission at week 26 compared to 18% of this group at week 12, 59% of patients initially randomised to receive 200 mg IV risankizumab achieving clinical remission at week 26 compared to 21% of this group at week 12, and 47% of patients initially randomised to 600 mg IV risankizumab achieving clinical remission at week 26 compared to 26% of this group at week 12. Clinical remission was maintained by 71% of patients at week 52.\n\n【36】Following early promise, a phase II/III, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre protocol evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (GALAXI) and a phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled treat-through study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of study of mirikizumab in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease are currently listed in clinicaltrials.gov as actively recruiting.\n\n【37】A number of the agents under investigation in Crohn’s disease are also known to play an important role in the management of chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Guselkumab, risankizumab, and tildrakizumab are currently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, with mirikizumab in Phase III clinical trials for the indication. The role of these agents in psoriatic arthritis remains under investigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>, with active phase III trials of guselkumab and risankizumab and a phase II/III trial of tildrakizumab.\n\n【38】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【39】The development and availability of agents that target IL-17 for a range of autoimmune inflammatory conditions, including chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, have provided an important therapeutic advance, with significant improvements in the patient’s symptoms and quality of life. Despite this, agents that target IL-17 have not been successful in the management of inflammatory bowel disease, with use of these agents associated with worsening of or, in some cases, the onset of the condition. It is, therefore, suggested that agents that target IL-17 should be used with caution in patients with comorbid inflammatory bowel disease or symptoms suggestive of it.\n\n【40】The past few years have seen a significant increase in the number of biologic agents approved for use by the FDA. The availability, success, and apparent safety of agents that target the p19 subunit of IL-23 make them an exciting family of agents to consider in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, especially where there is the suggestion, or diagnosis, of inflammatory bowel disease as a comorbidity. Investigations of their role in psoriatic arthritis are ongoing, with a number of agents showing early promise.\n\n【41】In this report, we have discussed the case of a 54-year-old female who experienced the onset and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease while on treatment with an agent that targets IL-17. We have discussed the improvement not only in her symptoms of chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but also in Crohn’s disease, with the use of an agent that targets the p19 subunit of IL-23.\n\n【42】With recent therapeutic advances and the availability of biologic agents that act via a range of mechanisms, it is more important than ever to consider all patient factors and comorbidities and to allow these to guide management choices to ensure the best possible outcome for each individual patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative disorder presented with different manifestations. However, bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (BAH) and adrenal insufficiency (AI) are rare manifestations. Herein, we described a patient who suffered from BAH and AI in the context of PV. Case Presentation. A 60-year-old man with an underlying history of PV was admitted with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of consciousness. Primitive computed tomography (CT) scan findings revealed bilateral adrenal masses (right: 40  23 mm, left: 60  35 mm) with the second scan showing quite similar results (right adrenal: 40  29 mm, left adrenal: 48  26 mm) suggesting BAH. The further adrenal assessment proved concurrent AI. Both adrenal masses resolved completely after 15 months. However, the patient still suffered from AI. Conclusion. BAH and AI in patients with PV should be considered rare complications requiring high clinical suspicion for early diagnosis and treatment to avoid life-threatening outcomes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Adrenal hemorrhage (AH) is a rare disorder with a prevalence ranging from 0.14 to 1.8% reported from post-mortem records 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Several predisposing factors have been suggested for this unusual disease, including septic shock, stress, abdominal trauma, pregnancy, coagulopathies, and different hematologic disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome and essential thrombocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. However, the incidence of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (BAH) and subsequent adrenal insufficiency (AI) in the context of polycythemia vera (PV), as one of the myeloproliferative disorders, is rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Herein, we described a patient with an underlying history of PV who experienced BAH and subsequent AI and reviewed the literature in this regard.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 60-year-old man with underlying hypertension and PV was admitted after an acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and concomitant loss of consciousness. On admission, he had a blood pressure of 110/75 mmHg. The patient mentioned prior episodes of vague abdominal pain over the past decade. He was diagnosed with PV 14 years ago on the basis of erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, and a bone marrow biopsy which was consistent with erythroid and myeloid hyperplasia without any grades of fibrosis. A PCR test for BCR-ABL1 was negative and the mutation JAK2V617F was detected. He denied using cigarettes and alcohol. His only medications were daily aspirin (80 mg), hydroxyurea (200 mg), and irregular usage of losartan (25 mg) and he did not mention usage of any other drugs. He irregularly performed phlebotomies and did not have good adherence to treatment. Based on previous medical records, his underlying disease was not well controlled and his last cell blood count revealed white blood cells (WBC) of 19.2  10<sup>3</sup>/l, hemoglobin of 14.2 g/dL, and platelet counts of 160  10<sup>6</sup>/l. There were no records indicating a hypertension control status. He denied any previous thrombotic events or any major bleeding episodes. On physical examination, he was lethargic and confused. Abdominal tenderness was present in the epigastrium as well as the periumbilical region, and splenomegaly was also noted in addition to left side costovertebral angle tenderness. As shown in Table 1, laboratory data were normal except for leukocytosis, which had been approved to be in the same range since he was diagnosed with PV.\n\n【7】Table 1 Laboratory results of the admitted patient.\n\n【8】Abdominopelvic spiral computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous and oral contrast was requested and revealed splenomegaly and a hypodense lesion with a mean 55 Hounsfield unit (HU) at the site of the right adrenal gland (40  23 mm) and another ill-defined soft tissue lesion (60  35 mm) with infiltrative margins at the site of the left adrenal gland without any evidence of vascular thrombosis. Supportive therapy was initiated, but the patient left the hospital due to personal desire and was admitted to one of the tertiary hospitals in Isfahan, Iran.\n\n【9】His vital signs on admission were the followings: blood pressure: 115/85 mmHg, heart rates: 100/min, respiratory rates: 20/min, T: 37.1°C, O<sub>2</sub> saturation: 85% on room air (94% with a face mask). He suffered from dyspnea, chest pain, and diarrhea. On physical examination, huge splenomegaly, generalized abdominal tenderness, and left costovertebral angle tenderness were noted. The requested electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia. Laboratory profile showed elevated creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin .\n\n【10】With prior suspicion of prerenal azotemia due to intraabdominal disorders including mesenteric ischemia, fluid replacement and broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed. Due to the presence of multiple air-fluid levels on the abdominal X-ray, surgical consultation was requested, which recommended observation and correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances. After two days, the patient’s symptoms improved, and he gained normal bowel function with normal creatinine. Due to the suspicion of adrenal disorders including probable pheochromocytoma or adrenal cancer, an abdominal CT scan with the adrenal protocol was performed that revealed huge splenomegaly (spleen span: 25 cm) and bilateral adrenal masses (right adrenal gland: 40  29 mm, left adrenal gland: 48  26 mm) without any enhancement and 50 HU subsequently in favor of adrenal hematoma . Comprehensive adrenal glands assessment was performed and revealed the followings: aldosterone; 45 pg/ml (reference range: 30–400 pg/ml), plasma renin; 12 pg/ml (reference range: 12–36 pg/ml), 17 (OH) progesterone; 1.3 ng/ml (reference range: 0.2–2.3 ng/ml) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS); 25 mcg/dl (reference range: 56–80 mcg/dl). A 24-hour urine analysis was also requested, and the following were reported: norepinephrine; 23.1 mcg/day, epinephrine; 0.7 mcg/day, normetanephrine; 112 mcg/day, metanephrine; 62 mcg/day, and vanillylmandelic acid; 6 mg/day. These finding collections including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and abnormal adrenal CT findings were in respect to nonfunctional adrenal masses that resulted in AI in the context of adrenal hematoma. Therefore, basal cortisol was checked and the result was less than 3 mcg/dl. A tetracosactide test was performed in a way that one milligram of tetracosactide was injected intramuscularly and the cortisol level was measured at baseline and 4 hours afterwards (basal serum cortisol at 8 AM; 2.28 mcg/dl, 4 hours; 10.37 mcg/dl). Finally, the AI was confirmed and the patient was treated with daily prednisolone (5 mg) and fludrocortisone (100 microgram). The patient was discharged in a stable condition after 12 days with a recommendation for a follow-up ultrasound.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bilateral adrenal masses in favor of adrenal hematoma.</u>\n\n【12】During the follow-up assessment, the patient acknowledged voluntarily discontinuing medication for AI after ten months of discharge. However, he had no clinical symptoms of AI. The adrenal hematoma was resolved gradually through periodic ultrasound assessments, and there was no evidence of adrenal masses on the abdominal CT scan 15 months after his discharge . Basal serum cortisol was 5.90 mcg/dL, and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 68.2 pg/ml. Further investigation with the tetracosactide test 4 hours after intramuscular injection of 1 mg tetracosactide revealed a serum cortisol level of 18.15 mcg/dL. Therefore, AI was documented, and daily prednisolone (5 mg) was prescribed again.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Resolved bilateral adrenal hematoma during follow-up assessment.</u>\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion and Conclusions\n\n【15】We reported an Iranian male patient with an underlying condition of myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN), most likely a PV, which manifested with signs and symptoms of BAH and resultant AI. Although this entity is quite rare in literature, high clinical suspicion is required for prompt diagnosis and treatment. PV is defined as MPN with pathologic growth-factor independent increased growth of erythroid precursors. In addition, myeloid and megakaryocytic lineages are also often affected, resulting in increased numbers of WBCs and platelets. JAK2V617F is the main culprit in this regard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most common symptoms of PV are attributed to hyper-viscosity leading to oxygen delivery impairment and headache, vision changes, fatigue, claudication, dizziness, and aquagenic pruritus, among commonly reported complaints 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, few reports described MPN/PV patients with concomitant BAH and/or AI . Gonen et al. reported a 56-year-old male admitted with nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and loss of appetite. His lab data revealed erythrocytosis and leukocytosis with confirmed PV diagnosis through bone marrow biopsy. A CT scan revealed bilateral adrenal masses measured 4  5  5.5 cm and 4  3  2 cm in the right and left adrenal glands, respectively. Basal serum cortisol of <138 nmol/l, ACTH of 550 pmol/l, and an ACTH stimulation test suggested simultaneous AI. During the periodic follow-up assessment, both adrenal lesions diminished significantly, and they were completely disappeared after two years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Another report was of an 85-year-old man who suffered from PV presented with abdominal tenderness and syncope finally diagnosed as BAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Bhandari et al. described a 64-year-old man with a chronic history of PV admitted with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. Further assessments were in favor of cardiogenic shock resulting from myocardial infarction. After percutaneous coronary intervention and stent insertion in the left anterior descending artery, he was still hypotensive and low random cortisol (3.3 mcg/dl) with a dramatic response to hydrocortisone stress dose proved AI as the main culprit. Also, a noncontrast CT scan revealed BAH (right adrenal: 5.3  3.4  3.8 cm, left adrenal: 6.1  4.3  5.4 cm) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Table 2 Summary of studies reported adrenal hemorrhage in the context of polycythemia vera.\n\n【17】Despite the quite low prevalence of AH, improvement in imaging technologies including sonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scan might yield to diagnose this topic more frequently with the latter being the modality of choice in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Adrenal hematomas appear round or oval, and peri-adrenal fat stranding is almost present. Acute or subacute adrenal hematomas contain high attenuation areas that usually range from 50–90 HU. Most adrenal hematomas resolve gradually over time, but some of them may resolve partially and cause permanent AI and lifelong hormone replacement requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The exact pathophysiological mechanisms of AH remain uncertain; however, the anatomic location and physiological properties might play roles. Three main arteries (the superior, middle, and inferior suprarenal arteries) in comparison to a single adrenal vein draining blood from adrenal glands might predispose to vascular congestion and subsequent AH. On the other hand, catecholamine release leads to vasoconstriction of the adrenal veins impairing blood outflow. Efferent adrenal vein thrombosis and hyperviscosity resulting from PV impair venous drainage and venous congestion, ultimately predisposing to AH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In conclusion, BAH with subsequent AI should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with myeloproliferative diseases, especially PV, presented with non-specific symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hypotension, in order to prevent life-threatening outcomes.\n\n【20】#### Abbreviations\n\n| AH: | Adrenal hemorrhage |\n| --- | --- |\n| BAH: | Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage |\n| AI: | Adrenal insufficiency |\n| PV: | Polycythemia vera |\n| WBC: | White blood cell |\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| HU: | Hounsfield unit |\n| ECG: | Electrocardiogram |\n| LDH: | Lactate dehydrogenase |\n| DHEAS: | Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate |\n| ACTH: | Adrenocorticotropic hormone |\n| MPN: | Myeloproliferative neoplasia |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The vast majority of post-traumatic meningitides are caused by infectious pathogens, most commonly multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens. However, aseptic meningitis occurs less frequently due to tissue response to injury or stimulation by noninfectious agents, such as blood breakdown products or chemicals. Here, we present a case of post-traumatic persistent neutrophilic meningitis who was found to be steroid responsive. Diagnostic evaluation in our patient did not reveal any infectious pathogen, and the patient did not respond to broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment. We suggest that physicians who treat patients with post-traumatic meningitis should consider steroid-responsive post-traumatic persistent neutrophilic meningitis (SPNM) in the list of differential diagnosis particularly when no infectious etiology is found and the patient does not respond to empirical antimicrobial treatment. Brain injury-induced immune dysregulation causing exaggerated inflammatory reaction might play a role in the pathogenesis of SPNM; however, further neuropathological studies are absolutely necessary to evaluate and characterize trauma-induced immune dysregulation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Post-traumatic meningitis is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. It is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Factors such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula, basilar skull fracture, burr hole surgery in the emergency department, and decompressive craniectomy are associated with post-traumatic meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The vast majority of post-traumatic meningitides are caused by infectious pathogens, most commonly multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However, aseptic meningitis occurs less frequently due to tissue response to injury or stimulation by noninfectious agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. CSF parameters can be suggestive of bacterial meningitis in the presence of compatible clinical syndrome. CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis is most often attributed to an infectious etiology; however, definitive diagnosis is confirmed when bacterial pathogens are isolated from CSF or blood specimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Here, we present a challenging clinical scenario of post-traumatic persistent neutrophilic meningitis in a young man.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】We present a 20-year-old male with a history of recent head trauma who presented to our emergency department with headache, fever, vomiting, and disorganized speech for 2 days. Head trauma had occurred about three weeks before his presentation during a motor vehicle accident leading to bilateral subdural hematoma that was managed by burr hole evacuation without craniotomy. He also developed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea that was managed conservatively.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed signs of meningeal irritation without focal neurological deficits. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed bilateral subdural effusion and diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement . A turbid fluid was obtained after lumbar puncture. CSF analysis revealed marked polymorphonuclear pleocytosis of 2250/μL, increased protein level of 285 mg/dL, and decreased glucose level of 20 mg/dL. All microbiological tests including blood and CSF culture for rapid-growing bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, Nocardia species, and Brucella species as well as PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Cryptococcal antigen repeatedly showed negative results. CSF cytological examination did not show any atypical cells.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Brain magnetic resonance imaging indicative of bilateral subdural effusion (arrowheads in (a, b)) and diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement predominantly on the anterior surface of both hemispheres (arrows in (c)).</u>\n\n【8】Broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimens did not improve clinical symptoms or CSF parameters . Brain MR venography, CT cisternography, and MRI of the spine did not show any additional abnormalities. There was no parameningeal source of infection that could be removed neurosurgically. Evaluation of other organ systems including echocardiography was unremarkable. Although collective clinical and paraclinical evidence was in favor of an infectious meningoencephalitis, no microorganisms were identified and response to broad-spectrum antimicrobials was disappointing.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 The changes of clinical and laboratory features of the patient and therapeutic regimens over time.</u>\n\n【10】Over the next few weeks, the patient experienced intermittent spikes of high-grade fever and rigors as well as excruciating headache and vomiting. Follow-up lumbar puncture was performed on several occasions during the first month of his hospital admission that revealed an increasing trend of CSF leukocyte count and protein levels while glucose level decreased below 20 mg/dL. Repeated evaluation of the blood and CSF for rapid-growing bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, Nocardia species, and Brucella species revealed negative results. Review of systems and laboratory evaluations for connective tissue disorders were negative. Serum immunoglobulins and complement levels were in normal range.\n\n【11】On the 5th week of hospitalization, while the patient was receiving meropenem and vancomycin without any clinical response, intravenous dexamethasone at a dose of 8 mg every 8 hours was added to the therapeutic regimen which was followed by dramatic improvement in patient’s clinical symptoms and signs as well as CSF parameters. Dexamethasone was tapered down gradually and discontinued after 2 months. Six and forty-month follow-up showed uneventful recovery.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Here we presented a case of steroid-responsive post-traumatic persistent neutrophilic meningitis (SPNM). Post-traumatic meningitis is a dreadful condition that presents as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge compared to community-acquired meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Diagnosing meningitis in patients with a recent neurosurgical procedure or head trauma can be challenging due to concurrent neurological deficits and/or decreased consciousness. Moreover, the typical symptoms and signs of meningeal irritation might be present in the absence of infection, mostly due to recent intracranial bleeding or neurosurgical procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our patient can be classified as a case of persistent neutrophilic meningitis. This syndrome is a poorly described variant of chronic meningitis characterized by the persistence of neutrophils in the CSF over a period greater than one week 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. While bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal pathogens are predominant causes of persistent neutrophilic meningitis particularly in cases of post-traumatic and post-neurosurgical meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–10\\]</u>, diagnostic evaluation in our patient did not reveal any infectious pathogen and the patient did not respond to broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment. A history of intracranial device placement, craniotomy, or trauma resulting in contamination of the CSF and the absence of other conditions that better explain fever or altered mental status make the diagnosis of infectious meningitis more plausible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, which firstly was the case in our patient. In addition, very high CSF neutrophil count and protein concentrations accompanied with significant hypoglycorrhachia, which were also evident in our patient, are usually best explained with an infectious etiology. Characteristic CSF pattern in bacterial meningitis has been described as glucose concentration of less than 40 mg/dL, protein concentration of over 200 mg/dL, and leukocyte count of above 1000/μL with over 80% being neutrophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In fact, bacterial meningitis is highly probable (≥99% certainty) when any of the following parameters is present: a CSF glucose concentration <34 mg/dL, a protein concentration >220 mg/dL, a leukocyte count >2000/μL, or a neutrophil count >1180/μL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However, interpretation of CSF parameters and clinical signs could be misleading in those with intracranial injuries. CSF profile can be significantly altered by intracerebral hemorrhage and/or local noninfectious inflammatory reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This aseptic inflammation resulting from tissue response to injury or stimulation by noninfectious agents, such as blood breakdown products or chemicals, must be distinguished from infection. Although CSF culture is regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of infectious meningitis, 15–30% of patients with infectious meningitis have negative CSF cultures, obtained before administration of antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【15】A complete clinical and paraclinical response to steroid treatment led us to the diagnosis of steroid-responsive post-traumatic persistent neutrophilic meningitis (SPNM) in our patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an acute post-traumatic noninfectious meningitis with severe CSF abnormalities and dramatic steroid responsiveness. Although corticosteroids are useful in improving the outcome of patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>, information regarding its use in post-traumatic or post-neurosurgical meningitis is limited. It has long been recognized that acute brain injury might result in a substantial inflammatory response with peripheral and central production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. We postulate that the meningitis syndrome in our patient was a manifestation of brain injury-induced immune dysregulation.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【17】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of steroid-responsive post-traumatic persistent neutrophilic meningitis (SPNM) which could be added as a new clinical entity under noninfectious post-traumatic meningitides. Physicians who treat patients with post-traumatic meningitis should consider SPNM as a differential diagnosis particularly when no infectious etiologies are found and/or the patient does not respond to empirical antimicrobial treatment. Brain injury-induced immune dysregulation with exaggerated inflammatory reaction might play a role in the pathogenesis of SPNM; however, further neuropathological studies are absolutely necessary to evaluate and characterize trauma-induced immune dysregulation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The diagnostic features of the disease are characteristic, but the clinical presentation and patterns of destructions may vary between patients. Successful management of the disease is challenging especially if diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, but not impossible with the current therapeutic choices for the disease. A vast array of treatment modalities is available which can be employed in the treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis with varying success rates, but a definite guideline for the management is yet to be formulated. However, with the exponential rate of developments in periodontal research, regenerative therapy, tissue engineering, and genetic technologies, the future seems promising in regard to options at managing the disease.

The disease which includes both localized and generalized forms was previously known as “early onset periodontitis” which included the three categories of periodontitis—prepubertal, juvenile, and rapidly progressing periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. It is interesting that the first ever reported detailed description of a recognized disease in early hominid evolution is a case of prepubertal periodontitis in an 2.5–3-million-year-old fossil remains of a juvenile Australopithecus africanus specimen which showed the typical pattern of alveolar bone destruction with migration of the affected deciduous molars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) is characterized by “generalized interproximal attachment loss affecting at least 3 permanent teeth other than first molars and incisors” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is a multifactorial disease where interplay of microbiologic, genetic, immunologic, and environmental/behavioral risk factors decides the onset, course, and severity. Pathogenic bacteria in the dental plaque especially Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u> have an indispensable role which elicits an aggravated host response which in turn is determined by the genetic and immunologic profile of the patient modified by environmental risk factors like smoking.\n\n【6】This paper attempts to describe the diagnostic features along with the periodontal management options of generalized aggressive periodontitis with the help of case reports with different clinical presentation and patterns of involvement and managed with different treatment modalities available. Finally an attempt to summarize the available protocol for a comprehensive management of GAgP is done which can serve as a guideline till more definite clear-cut guidelines are established for the disease in the future.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Clinical Features\n\n【8】The most common reported complaints are a recently noticed flaring and progressing spacing of anterior teeth and bleeding from gums comparatively in a young patient but patients can be older as well 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a)–1(c))</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Patient presenting with flaring of the anterior teeth. (b) and (c) Deep pockets revealed by probing in a periodontium with lack of clinical inflammation. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【10】Patients may complain of halitosis and pus discharge from gums. Mobility of the affected teeth will be seen towards the later stages of the infection. Patients will be otherwise systemically healthy. Severe pain is rarely experienced by the patients except in situations where a periodontal abscess develops or a periodontal-endodontic infection occurs via accessory canals or tooth apex. Some patients may complain of a dull nagging type of pain from gums. Gingival recession may be seen and patients may complain of food impaction due to loss of contact points between teeth.\n\n【11】GAgP patients who smoke and/or maintain a poor oral hygiene demonstrate more severe destruction of periodontium compared to those who do not smoke or maintain a satisfactory oral hygiene 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a)–2(e))</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | (a)–(d) Clinical and radiographic appearance of GAgP in a 25-year-old smoker with poor oral hygiene. (e) A 19-year-old smoker with GAgP demonstrating severe periodontal destruction. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【13】The disease progresses in alternating periods of activity and quiescence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. This leads to two types of presentation at the time of examination. In the periods of quiescence, patients are free of symptoms and the gingiva appears pink and healthy even though probing reveals deep periodontal pockets. Lack of visible signs of clinical inflammation despite the presence of deep periodontal pockets and severe attachment loss in an otherwise healthy young individual is the classic sign of aggressive periodontitis presenting at this stage 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a)–1(c))</u>. Probing should be done with calibrated periodontal probes at six sites around each tooth.\n\n【14】The periods of inactivity may remain for weeks to months or even years and will be followed by periods of active disease. During this period, there will be active bone destruction and attachment loss. When the patient presents in this stage, the gingiva will show all signs of mild to severe inflammation. Gingiva may be tender, fiery red, edematous, soft, and boggy. Bleeding on probing or even spontaneous bleeding and purulent exudation may be evident. Inflammatory gingival enlargement may also be noticed. The majority of the patients refer to dental consultation at this stage of the disease 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a)–3(c))</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | (a)–(c) Features of severe gingival inflammation presented at the stage of active disease. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【16】This stage may undergo spontaneous remission after a varying period of destruction and the inflammatory symptoms subside to reappear after a period of quiescence. Advanced stages of the untreated disease with severe periodontal destruction may show extrusion of teeth, mobility and pathologic migration, furcation involvement, generalized gingival recession, and loss of several teeth due to spontaneous exfoliation. Some patients may show systemic manifestations such as weight loss, mental depression and general malaise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Radiographic Features\n\n【18】Localized aggressive periodontitis typically presents “arc-shaped” mirror image radiolucency in the first molars starting from the distal aspect of second premolars to the mesial aspect of the second molar. In generalized aggressive periodontitis, radiographs may show generalized bone destruction ranging from mild crestal bone resorption to severe extensive alveolar bone destruction depending on the severity of the disease. The defects may be a combination of vertical and horizontal defects 删除1:<u>(Figures 4(a) and 4(b))</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | (a) Arc-shaped radiolucency at the 1st molar region in localized aggressive periodontitis. (b) Generalized distribution of bone loss seen in GAgP with vertical defects. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Diagnosis\n\n【21】Early diagnosis is of utmost importance for the prevention of extensive attachment loss and bone loss experienced in aggressive periodontitis. Diagnosis is made according to the criteria set by the American Academy of periodontology, 1999 classification of periodontal diseases and conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, using history, clinical features, and radiographic features aided by microbial examination if needed. Family history may reveal a history of early tooth loss in the parents or immediate blood relatives of the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The amount of microbial deposits will be inconsistent with the amount of destruction when compared to chronic periodontitis and plaque will be minimal. Comparison of serial radiographs helps in assessing the rapid rate of bone destruction and can aid in the diagnosis of the disease.\n\n【22】#### 5\\. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【23】Aggressive periodontitis can be differentiated from chronic periodontitis by the age of onset, rapid rate of disease progression, the nature and composition of the associated subgingival microflora, alterations in host immune response, and a familial aggregation of the diseased individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Systemic diseases like hematologic disorders and some genetic disorders also show periodontitis as a manifestation mimicking generalized aggressive periodontitis which can be ruled out by assessing the systemic status, hematologic data analysis, and immunologic profiling of the patient. In addition, there are rare reports of certain conditions like intraosseous sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>, eosinophilic granuloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u> and alveolar bone actinomycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>, presenting with extensive alveolar bone destruction like in aggressive periodontitis which can be differentiated by biopsy of the suspected lesions.\n\n【24】#### 6\\. Case Reports\n\n【25】##### 6.1. Case Report 1\n\n【26】A 32-year-old female patient presented with the complaint of a recently noticed spacing between the upper front teeth. 删除1:<u>(Figures 5(a)–5(d))</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | (a)–(d) Deep pockets were present even though signs of gingival inflammation other than bleeding on probing were absent. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【28】The patient noticed the spacing about 1 year before, after which she noticed it to be gradually increasing and associated with intermittent episodes of pus discharge which subsided on taking antibiotics as per advice at a local hospital. There were no associated complaints other than a cosmetic concern from the patient. There was no history of any previous dental treatment. Family history of similar complaints or early tooth loss could not be elicited. The patient was systemically healthy with no relevant medical history.\n\n【29】There were no abnormalities detected in extra oral examination except for a slightly tender and palpable left submandibular lymph node. Full complement of teeth was present. The oral hygiene status of the patient was good as revealed by the oral hygiene index. There was minimal amount of calculus and plaque. There was grade I mobility of 22, 31, 32, 21 and 22. Proximal contacts were lost between the teeth 14 and 13, 13 and 12, 21 and 22 and 22 and 23, 22 and 24 and between lower anterior teeth. There was labial migration and flaring of upper and lower anterior teeth with an evident distolabial migration of 22.\n\n【30】Gingival examination revealed normal color except for the labial aspect of 22 where it was slightly reddish. The margins were of knife-edge contour except for the labial aspect of 22 and 42 where it was bluntly rounded. The gingiva was firm and resilient except in the region on 22 where it was soft in consistency. There was no loss of stippling in the anterior regions. The position of the gingival margin was apical to the CEJ in the labial aspect of 22. There was generalized bleeding on probing, and exudation was present on the labial aspect of 22. All together there were minimal signs of inflammation other than bleeding on probing.\n\n【31】A full-mouth periodontal charting revealed generalized periodontal pockets and clinical attachment loss .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 | Periodontal charting showing generalized deep pockets and clinical attachment loss. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【33】Pockets were especially deeper in the molar and incisor regions with slightly lesser involvement in the premolar region. The clinical attachment loss ranged from a maximum of 10 mm in the midpalatal aspect of 16 to a minimum of 2 mm in the premolar regions.\n\n【34】An OPG and full-mouth IOPA X-ray were performed which revealed the generalized distribution of alveolar bone loss which was a combination of both horizontal and vertical bone loss . Routine blood examination results were within normal limits.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 | Orthopantomogram of the patient demonstrating generalized distribution of bone loss. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【36】Based on the history, examination findings, and the radiographic findings, a diagnosis of generalized aggressive periodontitis was made according to the criteria by AAP 1999 classification.\n\n【37】##### 6.2. Management\n\n【38】A thorough supragingival scaling was performed following which the patient was motivated for better plaque control. A sulcus brushing technique (modified Bass technique) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> was demonstrated, and the patient was educated on the use of interdental cleansing aids including dental floss and interdental brushes. Chlorhexidine mouth wash was prescribed to further aid in plaque control. Systemic antibiotics (Amoxycillin and Metronidazole, 250 mg of each thrice daily) were prescribed for 8 days, and the patient was recalled after 2 weeks for evaluation of the response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【39】A subgingival scaling was performed after which the patient was advised to continue the chlorhexidine mouthwashes. A reevaluation 2 weeks after subgingival scaling showed a reduction in probing depths and absence of bleeding on probing.\n\n【40】A quadrant-wise full-mouth flap surgery was performed including bone grafting in relation to the molar regions where predominantly vertical or intrabony defects were detected. A modified Widman flap surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> in conjunction with bone replacement graft was performed in the molar regions 删除1:<u>(Figures 8(a)–8(e))</u> whereas a sulcular incision flap (Kirkland flap) was performed in the maxillary and mandibular anterior region to minimize the recession after healing for esthetic purposes.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8 | (a)–(e) Modified Widman flap in conjunction with bone grafting performed. (f) Postoperative evaluation showing probing depth within normal limits. (g) 6-Month postoperative intraoral periapical radiographs. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【42】A preprocedural rinse with antimicrobial agent was done to minimize the bacterial count in the mouth. After adequately anesthetizing the surgical site with infiltration anesthesia and nerve blocks, the first incision (internal bevel incision) 0.5 mm from the gingival margin directing to the crest of the alveolar bone was made. The flap was reflected following which sulcular incision and interdental incision were made to remove the wedge of tissue. Curettage for granulation tissue removal was done following which a through subgingival debridement and root planning was performed. The defect was irrigated with normal saline, and a root conditioning with tetracycline was performed. The graft was a xenograft (Bovine graft—Ossopan), which was mixed with the blood from the surgical site and placed into the defect after presuturing the site with silk sutures. Care was taken to fill the graft to a realistic level and not to overpack the defect. Suturing was done after adapting the buccal and lingual flaps well. A periodontal pack was placed, and antibiotics and analgesics were prescribed for the patient for 5 days. A fluoride-containing mouthwash was prescribed postsurgically to the patient.\n\n【43】Healing was uneventful, and a postoperative evaluation 3 weeks after surgery showed absence of bleeding on probing and probing depths within normal limits 删除1:<u>(Figure 8(f))</u>. The patient was put on regular recall appointments for evaluation of the gingival and periodontal status and maintenance therapy. A postoperative radiograph 6 months later showed a significant bone fill in the molar regions where grafting was done with an increase in bone density of the alveolar crest with corticated bone formations in the crest at the other areas 删除1:<u>(Figure 8(g))</u>. The oral hygiene maintenance and compliance of the patient was excellent, and there were no signs of recurrence of the disease throughout the maintenance period. Since the patient was concerned about the esthetic appearance of the anterior teeth, she was advised to undergo adult orthodontic therapy after 1 year of surgery under regular periodontal monitoring and was referred to an orthodontic specialist for the same.\n\n【44】##### 6.3. Case Report 2\n\n【45】A 26-year-old male patient presented with the chief complaint of generalized pus discharge from gums which he had been experiencing intermittently for the past 2 years 删除1:<u>(Figures 9(a) and 9(b))</u>. Pus discharge was associated with bad breath and usually subsided spontaneously after a few weeks. There was no associated complaint other than a generalized mild hypersensitivity to cold and sweet food. He had a history of extraction of lower left posterior tooth due to caries exposure and extraction of lower front tooth due to mobility about 1 year before. There was no history of any other dental treatment.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 9 | (a) and (b) Clinical presentation with deep pockets, recession, and pathologic migration of teeth. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【47】The patient was systemically healthy, and medical history did not reveal any relevant findings. Family history revealed that the patient’s mother had similar complaints of mobility, pus discharge, and spontaneous exfoliation of some teeth following which she consulted a dentist and underwent total extraction by the age of 40. The patient was a nonsmoker, and there was no history of use of any other forms of tobacco.\n\n【48】Extraoral examination revealed bilateral submandibular lymph node enlargement, which was firm, mobile, and nontender.\n\n【49】All teeth were present except for 46, 26, and 41. Tooth 46 was extracted due to caries and 41 was extracted due to mobility. Tooth 26 was grossly decayed with just root stump present. The oral hygiene status of the patient was fair with moderate deposits of calculus and plaque.\n\n【50】Intraoral examination revealed a normal color of gingiva except in the labial aspect of 31, 32, and 33 where the marginal gingiva was slightly reddish. Gingival margins were rounded, and exudation was present in relation to labial aspects of mandibular anterior teeth and maxillary central incisors. There was generalized bleeding on probing and recession in relation to most of the teeth, especially more in maxillary central incisors and mandibular anterior teeth.\n\n【51】There was grade I mobility of 15 and 22 and grade II mobility of 11, 12, 21, 31, 32, 33 and 42. Proximal contacts were lost between maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth with pathologic migration of 11, 21, 31, 32, and 42 and extrusion of 31. Grade II furcation involvement was present with molars and maxillary first premolars. A full mouth periodontal examination revealed generalized deep periodontal pockets and severe generalized clinical attachment loss .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 10 | Pretreatment periodontal charting shows deep pockets with generalized clinical attachment loss. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【53】Severe periodontal destruction was evident with more than 10 mm of clinical attachment loss at multiple sites especially in the incisor and canine regions.\n\n【54】OPG and IOPA X-rays revealed a generalized distribution of periodontal bone loss especially severe in the incisor and canine regions with the molars and premolars affected to a lesser degree . There was predominantly vertical bone loss in the canine and incisor regions. Routine blood investigations were within normal limits.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 11 | Orthopantomogram showing generalized bone loss with advanced vertical defect in 13 and 33 regions. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【56】A diagnosis of generalized aggressive periodontitis was made according to the established criteria (American Academy of Periodontology, 1999).\n\n【57】##### 6.4. Management\n\n【58】Supragingival scaling was performed, and the patient was educated in oral hygiene maintenance. The patient was advised to follow a modified Stillman technique of brushing since the patient had root exposure and hypersensitivity and also advised to use interdental brushes and dental floss for optimal plaque control. The patient was prescribed topical antimicrobial agents (metronidazole gel) along with chlorhexidine mouthwash for 2 weeks. A combination systemic antibiotic therapy of amoxicillin and metronidazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> was initiated, and a desensitizing agent was prescribed. A recall visit after 2 weeks showed reduction in inflammation and percentage of sites showing bleeding on probing. Exudation was persistent in relation to 11 and 33 regions. A subgingival scaling and root planing was performed following which a povidone iodine 5% irrigation was performed. A nonsustained professionally delivered local drug delivery with metronidazole gel was injected subgingivally at sites 33 and 11, following which a periodontal dressing was given at the site. The procedure was performed every 3 days for the next 2 weeks. Evaluation after 3 weeks showed complete absence of bleeding on probing, exudation, and significant reduction in probing pocket depth. The patient was put on maintenance therapy during which he continued with the topical antimicrobial agents and desensitizing agents and was evaluated for surgical therapy.\n\n【59】A full-mouth flap surgery with bone grafts (synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAP)), where indicated, was performed sextantwise at intervals of two weeks. In addition, the defect at site 33 was treated with guided tissue regeneration (GTR) with bioresorbable collagen membrane in conjunction with synthetic bone graft (HAP) 删除1:<u>(Figures 12(a)–12(f))</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 12 | (a)–(c) Flap surgery in conjunction with bone grafting (HAP) and papilla preservation flap between 11 and 21.

Radiographs showed bone fill in the region where bone grafts alone or in conjunction with GTR were used 删除1:<u>(Figures 13(c) and 13(d))</u>. Regular recall appointments were given for maintenance therapy during which the treatment results were well maintained. However, there was a slight increase in recession due to shrinkage of gingiva on healing and hypersensitivity after the surgery which gradually subsided on regular use of desensitizing agents and fluoride mouthwashes.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 13 | (a) and (b) Postoperative photographs showing probing depths within normal limits with excellent gingival condition; however, there was slight increase in recession after healing.

Discussion\n\n【64】The key to successful treatment is early diagnosis. Early diagnosis helps in prevention of progression of the disease thus avoiding the possibility of advanced tissue destruction and alveolar bone loss. The earlier the diagnosis is the better the prognosis of the dentition will be. Furthermore since it has a tendency for familial aggregation, it is important to do a periodontal examination of siblings and other close blood relatives of the patient which helps in early diagnosis of the disease in the family members. Management of GAgP patients essentially consists of a nonsurgical phase, surgical therapy an interdisciplinary therapy and a lifelong supportive periodontal therapy.\n\n【65】##### 7.1. Nonsurgical/Etiotropic Phase of Therapy\n\n【66】Nonsurgical therapy remains the first line of antimicrobial therapy in GAgP. Early stages of the disease with mild to moderate periodontal and bone destruction may be managed entirely by nonsurgical therapy with systemic antibiotics as an adjuvant to mechanical therapy.\n\n【67】Therapy should start with attempts at controlling or eliminating the etiologic agents and modifiable risk factors for the disease. The disease has a strong genetic predisposition. The host response of the patient or the susceptible individual to pathogenic bacteria in the dental plaque plays a vital role in the pathogenesis and expression of the disease, and this host response is genetically determined and is an unmodifiable risk factor is at present by the current treatment measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. However, since the expression of the disease in susceptible individuals is also influenced by microbial and environmental risk factors, the disease can be successfully kept under control by controlling the microbial and environmental factors. This underlies the importance of optimal plaque control both by personally employed methods used by the patient himself and professionally employed plaque control measures by the dental team to the patient. Even a minimal amount of plaque is enough to elicit untoward host response in those patients susceptible to the disease, and a reduced resistance to the invasion of subgingival plaque can be compensated for by a correspondingly strong emphasis on total plaque control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【68】Mechanical plaque control can be successfully achieved by educating and motivating the patient if needed with the aid of disclosing solutions regarding the need for optimal plaque control, demonstration of brushing techniques (modified Bass technique for patients without gingival recession and modified Stillman technique in patients with hypersensitivity and generalized recession), and use of interdental cleansing aids like dental floss and interdental brushes where indicated. This behavioral modification from the patient needs a positive reinforcement and encouragement from the dental team. Regular recall appointments to monitor the efficacy of the patient’s plaque control measures are essential.\n\n【69】Chemical plaque control agents like chlorhexidine 0.12% or 0.2% mouthwashes, and 1% povidone iodine can be advised for further plaque control as an adjunct to the patient’s mechanical plaque control measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Amine fluoride and stannous fluoride mouth rinses and tooth pastes as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures in GAgP patients were found to be effective in controlling supragingival plaque accumulations in aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 30\\]</u>. Additionally use of fluoride mouthwashes is advised to help in remineralization of the exposed root surfaces, and for patients complaining of hypersensitivity, use of desensitizing toothpastes and mouthwashes is mandatory.\n\n【70】Smoking has been well documented as a significant risk factor for aggressive periodontitis with GAgP patients who smoke having more affected teeth and more loss of clinical attachment than nonsmoking patients with GAgP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Furthermore the response to periodontal therapy, both nonsurgical and surgical, regenerative therapy, and implant therapy is less than in nonsmokers, but former smokers respond similar to nonsmokers. This underlies the therapeutic effect of smoking cessation and cessation of other forms of tobacco, and patients should be advised of the benefits of smoking cessation and the potential risks of smoking in worsening their periodontal condition, and if needed expert counseling for cessation of the habit should be sought 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32–36\\]</u>.\n\n【71】###### 7.1.1. Mechanical Antimicrobial Therapy\n\n【72】Scaling and root planing (SRP) which eliminates the microbial bacterial load from the periodontal pockets and removes the local etiologic factors is performed either as a quadrant-wise SRP at 2-week interval or as a full mouth scaling and root planning completed on the same day. However, both modalities have been found to be efficacious with significant improvement in clinical parameters, and the clinician should select the treatment modality based on the practical considerations related to the patient preference and clinical workload 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.\n\n【73】Another approach to mechanical antimicrobial therapy is a one-stage full mouth disinfection therapy devised by Quirynen et al. which was found to result in an improved clinical outcome and microbial improvement in early onset periodontitis compared to quadrant-wise SRP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. Full-mouth disinfection therapy includes full-mouth debridement (scaling and root planning, brushing of the tongue with 1% chlorhexidine for 1 minute, rinsing of the mouth with a 0.2% chlorhexidine solution for 2 minutes, and irrigation of periodontal pockets with 1% chlorhexidine solution), completed in 2 appointments within a 24-hour period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>.\n\n【74】###### 7.1.2. Photodynamic Therapy and Laser Irradiation\n\n【75】These have been tried as adjuncts to mechanical therapy to inhibit the pathogenic bacteria in periodontal pockets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41–44\\]</u>.\n\n【76】Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a noninvasive photochemical approach for infection control which combines the application of a nontoxic chemical agent or photosensitizer with low-level light energy and has shown clinical evidence of efficient eradication of periodontal bacteria from subgingival sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. This novel therapeutic approach of antimicrobial therapy seems promising and is getting attention recently either as a monotherapy or as an adjunct to SRP in the nonsurgical treatment of aggressive periodontitis. Both PDT and SRP have been shown to have similar clinical results in the nonsurgical treatment of aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42, 43\\]</u>.\n\n【77】Laser irradiation of subgingival sites to eradicate periodontopathic microorganisms is also being considered in the nonsurgical therapy of periodontitis patients. Diode laser treatment has shown a superior clinical and microbiological effect when used along with SRP, compared to SRP alone or laser therapy alone in aggressive periodontitis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.\n\n【78】A regular recall visit preferably at one-week intervals should be performed especially at the initial stages of the treatment to monitor the efficiency of the patient’s plaque control measures and to assess the response of the patient towards nonsurgical therapy.\n\n【79】###### 7.1.3. Chemical Antimicrobial Therapy in the Management of GAgP\n\n【80】Role of Systemic Antibiotic Therapy in GAgP  \nSystemic antibiotics are indicated in aggressive periodontitis since the pathogenic bacteria like Aggregatibacter actinomycetem-comitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis have been found to be tissue invasive and mechanical therapy is insufficient to eliminate the bacteria from these sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58, 59\\]</u>. Systemically administered antibiotics with or without scaling and root planning and/or surgery provided greater clinical improvement in attachment level change compared to similar periodontal therapy without antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Earlier tetracyclines were used extensively for this purpose since systemic tetracycline was found to be a useful adjunct to mechanical periodontal therapy in patients with aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46–48\\]</u>, but the concern for tetracycline resistance has shifted the focus to the use of other antibiotics both as combination therapy or serial antibiotic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.  \nThe preferred combination antibiotic therapy at present for treatment of GAgP is 250 mg of amoxicillin thrice daily along with metronidazole 250 mg twice daily for 8 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 49\\]</u>. It is one of the most evaluated drug combinations in GAgP, and there is ample evidence now to show that Amoxycillin-Metronidazole combination as an adjunctive treatment in GAgP at initial therapy significantly improves the results and hence should be preferred over other antibiotic regimens as the first-line treatment  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50–55\\]</u>.  \nThe usefulness of microbial testing may be limited because of the variability of test reports between different labs and the mixed flora, and hence an empiric use of antibiotics like the above-mentioned combination may be more clinically sound and cost-effective than bacterial identification and antibiotic-sensitivity testing in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.  \nSingle-agent therapy with Doxycycline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53, 55\\]</u>, azithromycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>, metronidazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53, 57\\]</u>, and clindamycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u> is effective when used adjunctively to nonsurgical procedure of SRP in AgP patients. The criteria for selection of antibiotics are not clear in AgP; the choice depends on the case, disease-related factors and patient-related factors like compliance, allergies, and potential side effects.\n\n【81】Table 1 The list of antibiotic regimens with evidence of superior clinical outcome when used as an adjuvant to SRP in GAgP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 45–57\\]</u>.\n\n【82】###### 7.1.4. Local Drug Delivery of Antimicrobial Agents\n\n【83】Topical application of antimicrobial agents and local drug delivery is also a treatment option especially if there are localized areas of exudation and deep pockets not responding adequately to mechanical and systemic antibiotic therapy. Local drug delivery delivers the drugs at high concentrations at the site of infection when compared to systemic antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, this is an option in patients where there is intolerance to systemic administration of the antibiotic.\n\n【84】Several local anti-infective agents combined with SRP appear to provide additional benefits in PD reduction and CAL gain compared to SRP alone. Over the past 20 years, locally delivered, anti-infective pharmacological agents, most recently employing sustained-release vehicles, have been introduced to achieve this goal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>.\n\n【85】Though there is more evidence on its application in chronic periodontitis, till future researches are available; the same agents can be employed in aggressive periodontitis patients as well empirically. Adjunctive use of LDD agents like controlled release biodegradable chlorhexidine gluconate chip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61, 62\\]</u>, tetracycline fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63, 64\\]</u>, and minocycline-Hcl gel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65\\]</u> has been tried in aggressive periodontitis with superior clinical outcomes. The decision to use local anti-infective adjunctive therapy remains a matter of individual clinical judgment, the phase of treatment, and the patient’s status and preferences.\n\n【86】An evaluation of the response to nonsurgical treatment is done 2-3 weeks after treatment during which the gingival and periodontal status of the patient will be reevaluated and compared with the pretreatment values to assess the response to therapy and to assess the areas which need surgical therapy. Sites with persisting pockets >5 mm depth, vertical bone defects which need regenerative therapy, difficult to instrument areas like furcation involvement, and areas which need recontouring or resective osteoplasty are indications for surgery.\n\n【87】##### 7.2. Surgical Therapy\n\n【88】It essentially consists of open flap debridement either alone or as a combination with resective or regenerative procedures. The main aim of a flap procedure is to get access and visibility to root and furcation areas so that a thorough instrumentation and debridement can be performed. Flap techniques like modified Widman flap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>, modified flap operation/Kirkland flap (sulcular incision flap) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[66\\]</u> achieve this aim without eliminating the pockets. A resective flap procedure like undisplaced flap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u> will eliminate the pockets as well but compromise the esthetics and function of the dentition by root exposure and resultant hypersensitivity and hence is not preferred usually when compared to modified Widman flap or sulcular incision flap.\n\n【89】Laser-assisted surgery (Nd: YAG laser) is suggested as a valid alternative to conventional scalpel surgical therapy, in individuals at increased surgical risk like in coagulation and platelet function disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[68\\]</u>.\n\n【90】###### 7.2.1. Regenerative Surgical Therapy\n\n【91】Regeneration of the periodontal supporting structures lost due to periodontal disease so that the form and function of the periodontium is reestablished has been an elusive or difficult-to-achieve goal for periodontal therapists.\n\n【92】Various modalities are being employed for periodontal regeneration which includes use of bone replacement grafts, barrier membranes or guided tissue regeneration (GTR), biologic modifiers like growth and differentiation factors (GDF), and extracellular matrix proteins like enamel matrix proteins (EMD) or use of a combination of the above techniques and materials which has been extensively reviewed elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[69\\]</u>.\n\n【93】A sulcular incision flap or papilla preservation flap will be the ideal technique to minimize recession in the anterior regions due to esthetic reasons, and modified Widman flap or conventional/sulcular incision flap will be the technique of choice in the posterior regions when opting for bone grafting and another regenerative therapy. A papilla preservation flap is preferred for bone grafting when there is spacing between the teeth to obtain maximum coverage of the graft material at the interdental region and to prevent shrinkage of papilla on healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u>. Biomodification of the root surface (Root conditioning) with citric acid, tetracycline, or fibronectin is preferable when performing bone grafting or GTR for better clinical results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[69\\]</u>.\n\n【94】###### 7.2.2. Bone Replacement Grafts\n\n【95】Bone grafting is indicated in vertical defects, and the success of the procedure depends on the type of defect. Three-walled or intrabony defect is the ideal defect for bone grafts and has a better success rate compared to a two-walled and one-walled defect. The type of bone graft which gives the maximum benefit with minimum tissue reaction is autograft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[70\\]</u>, but there are limitations of obtaining it in large quantities as is needed in most cases of generalized aggressive periodontitis. A more feasible option is to use commercially available bone grafts, which are allograft, xenograft, or alloplastic materials.\n\n【96】Allografts used for periodontal grafts include mineralized freeze-dried bone allografts (FDBAs) which are osteoconductive, and decalcified freeze-dried bone allografts (DFDBAs) which are osteoinductive. Decalcification of the graft exposes the complex bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) from its matrix which can induce osteoblastic proliferation in the recipient site. DFDBA, because of its osteoinductive property, has shown to have better results than the alloplastic materials which are osteoconductive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[71\\]</u>. Allogeneic freeze-dried bone (FDBA) mixed with tetracycline powder along with systemic tetracycline has demonstrated a better clinical outcome in treatment of juvenile periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72\\]</u>.\n\n【97】Xenografts used are either bovine derived or coral derived. An osteoconductive bovine-derived anorganic bone, Bio-Oss, has been successfully used in periodontal defects with resulting bone regeneration and new attachment in these defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[73–75\\]</u>. Human histologic studies have shown that a combination of Bio-Oss with either purified porcine collagen (Bio-Oss Collagen) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[76\\]</u> or a synthetic cell-binding polypeptide (Pepgen P-15) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[77\\]</u> has the capacity of inducing regeneration of the periodontal attachment apparatus when placed in intrabony defects. Coralline grafts implanted into human periodontal defects have produced better clinical results when compared to nongrafted sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[78\\]</u>.\n\n【98】Synthetic grafts/alloplastic grafts have been considered primarily as defect fillers. The most commonly used among alloplastic graft materials is hydroxyapatite (HAP) which is osteoconductive and has shown to have similar clinical effect to FDBA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[79\\]</u>. Other alloplastic grafts which can be used are beta tricalcium phosphate and bioactive glass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[80, 81\\]</u>.\n\n【99】A synthetic hydroxyapatite/equine type I collagen/chondroitin sulphate biomaterial (Biostite) has been found to show comparable improvements to Bio-Oss in terms of clinical attachment gain, pocket depth reduction, and radiographic bone fill in the treatment of deep intraosseous defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[82\\]</u>.\n\n【100】###### 7.2.3. Guided Tissue Regeneration\n\n【101】Guided tissue regeneration promotes regeneration by acting as a barrier which prevents apical migration of epithelium and exclude gingival connective tissue from the healing wound, thus allowing the pluripotent periodontal ligament cells to populate the site of healing enhancing new cementum and new attachment procedures.\n\n【102】GTR has shown to have a greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement alone, including improved attachment gain, reduced pocket depth, less increase in gingival recession, and more gain in hard tissue probing at reentry surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[83\\]</u>. Research has shown that GTR in conjunction with bone grafting has better potential for regeneration compared with either technique alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[74, 84, 85\\]</u>, and this outcome has been confirmed in aggressive periodontitis also with the use of bioresorbable membranes (Bio-Gide) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[75, 80\\]</u>.\n\n【103】###### 7.2.4. Biologic Mediators and Extracellular Proteins\n\n【104】A wide array of regenerative materials is being considered for use in periodontitis. Use of biologic mediators like growth factors (insulin-like growth factor (ILGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)) use of platelet-rich plasma which contains PDGF, extracellular matrix proteins like emdogain, etc. are of promising results. Application of enamel matrix proteins alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[86\\]</u> or in combination with bone grafts including bioactive glass has shown to result in the successful treatment of intrabony defects in aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[87\\]</u>.\n\n【105】Beneficial effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of periodontal defects have been demonstrated by clinical and radiographic measurements together with reentry results showing marked improvements from baseline with increased stabilization of whole dentition including the hopeless teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[88, 89\\]</u>.\n\n【106】Various commercially available regenerative materials including bone replacement grafts, GTR membranes, enamel matrix derivatives, are in the market for use in periodontal therapy with varying results, and the choice of the material depends on the dentist’s preference and experience with the products helping in clinical judgment of the therapeutic results of individual products and procedures and their cost-benefit ratio.\n\n【107】##### 7.3. Role of Maintenance Therapy in Management of Aggressive Periodontitis\n\n【108】The importance of supportive periodontal therapy has to be stressed in management of aggressive periodontitis. Regular SPT was found to be effective in maintaining clinical and microbiological improvements attained after active periodontal therapy in early onset periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[90\\]</u>.\n\n【109】The maintenance therapy starts soon after the phase I therapy or nonsurgical therapy and should be continued throughout the lifetime of the patient. Or in other words, “maintenance therapy never ends” for a GAgP patient. In order to maintain the optimal results got by surgery and to prevent the recurrence of the disease, a lifelong maintenance therapy is mandatory because of the strong genetic susceptibility of the individual to the disease.\n\n【110】The frequency of the recall visits depends on the response of the individual to treatment and presence of other risk factors like environmental factors but generally will be more frequent than that in chronic periodontitis or in localized aggressive periodontitis. Any site which shows signs of recurrence of the disease like bleeding on probing which is considered as the first clinical sign of inflammation should be treated vigorously and monitored for resolution of the signs.\n\n【111】##### 7.4. Interdisciplinary Approach for Management of Resultant Esthetic, Functional, and Psychologic Problems in GAgP\n\n【112】A comprehensive management for total rehabilitation of the GAgP patients not only involves control of infection and arrest of progression and/or regenerative therapy by the periodontist but also incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to attend the esthetic, functional, and psychologic problems faced by the patient.\n\n【113】An orthodontic therapy with concomitant periodontal monitoring and prosthetic rehabilitation, if possible with the use of implants and psychologic counseling, may be needed for patients with advanced forms of the disease.\n\n【114】###### 7.4.1. Combined Periodontal-Orthodontic Therapy\n\n【115】Cosmetic concerns in young aggressive periodontitis patients will be high since the disease can result in flaring, protrusion, pathologic migration, and even extrusion of the anterior teeth. Malocclusion, pathologic migration and potential occlusal traumatism which can cause secondary trauma from occlusion can be corrected by orthodontic therapy in GAgP patients already stabilized by periodontal therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[91–94\\]</u>. Orthodontic treatment can be commenced once attachment gain and bone stability is achieved after periodontal therapy but is generally advised to postpone till 3 months to 1 year after active periodontal therapy. A combined periodontal and orthodontic treatment demands a detailed evaluation in both specialties, particularly when the periodontium is reduced. Periodontal evaluations are scheduled concomitantly with orthodontic appointments to monitor the periodontal stability as the tooth movement occurs.\n\n【116】###### 7.4.2. Prosthodontic Rehabilitation, Implant Therapy, and Implant Supported Prosthesis\n\n【117】Gingival recession with loss of interdental papilla especially in the anterior teeth is unaesthetic especially when the patient smiles and the feasibility of root coverage periodontal plastic surgery will be limited in generalized aggressive periodontitis because of the large number of teeth involved and the advanced interdental bone loss. A porcelain, resin, silicone, or copolyamide removable gingival prosthesis (gum veneer/gingival mask) can be fabricated to mask the recession and improve the appearance of the anterior teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[95\\]</u>. The restoration of the teeth lost due to periodontitis should be done with fixed or removable prosthesis depending on the bone support of the remaining teeth.\n\n【118】Contradictory to the earlier concept that implants are not a feasible option in GAgP patients, the use of implants and implant-supported prosthesis to restore the lost teeth is increasingly considered as a treatment option in well-maintained GAgP patients even though the risk of bone loss and attachment loss around implants is higher than that in chronic periodontitis patients or periodontally healthy individuals, with researches showing good survival of implants over a 10-year period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[96\\]</u>. Several reports are there which have successfully used osseointegrated implants in oral rehabilitation of partially edentulous patients treated for GAgP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[97–99\\]</u>.\n\n【119】###### 7.4.3. Psychotherapy\n\n【120】Perhaps the least recognized and the most underestimated aspect in the total rehabilitation of a patient with GAgP presenting with multiple tooth loss and/or advanced periodontal destruction necessitating extraction of multiple teeth is the need for psychological counseling and psychotherapy. It aims at attending the psychologic effect and potential mental depression following tooth loss due to rapid periodontal destruction which provides the patient with relatively less time to cope with the situation. The emotional effects of tooth loss are devastating for some patients and have a dramatic impact on their life, and they take longer time to come to terms with the tooth loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[100\\]</u>. Preparing the patients with advanced disease having multiple teeth with hopeless prognosis emotionally for extraction also has to be dealt with carefully by the dentist, if needed using multiple appointments, and the extent of the impact that bad news, such as having to lose teeth, has on an individual is most often dependent on the way in which the information is communicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[101\\]</u>. Depression, anxiety and social withdrawal are seen in patients with tooth loss, and resulting compromised esthetics can be helped with therapy, relaxation techniques, and, in some cases, antidepressants. Any of the above symptoms should be addressed with a qualified psychotherapist to improve the quality of life.\n\n【121】Psychotherapy has to be started immediately following the first appointment and should be continued concomitantly for total rehabilitation of the patient for a variable duration depending upon the psychologic status of the individual patient. In addition, stress reduction protocols may help in management of the disease as such in the view of the recent suggestions of the proposed mechanisms by which stress can contribute to the onset, exacerbation and maintenance of the periodontal disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[102\\]</u>. A recent study reported that psychotherapy offered at 3 levels (individual, group, and conjoint family psychotherapy) to GAgP patients gave positive psychologic effects that restored their ability to socialize in their environment contributing to their positive experience in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[103\\]</u>. The above facts suggest that psychotherapy be incorporated for the future protocols for treatment of GAgP patients suffering from emotional effects of tooth loss.\n\n【122】###### 7.4.4. Other Treatment Modalities and Future Trends in Management of Aggressive Periodontitis\n\n【123】Host modulation therapy with systemically and locally administered agents is under research for therapy in aggressive periodontitis. Subantibacterial dose of Doxycycline has been approved for use in chronic periodontitis, but its use in aggressive periodontitis has to be confirmed by research. Adjunctive use of locally administered alendronate gel with SRP for host modulation has shown promising results in aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[104\\]</u>.\n\n【124】Newer generations of regenerative materials and advances in tissue engineering for regeneration and genetic engineering to modify the genetic risk factors seem to be really promising in the future. With further understanding of the genetic risk factors, a futuristic application of genetic screening tests will be in identifying the susceptible individuals and instituting the preventive measures to keep the gene expression and thus the disease under control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[105, 106\\]</u>.\n\n【125】###### 7.4.5. A Suggested Protocol for the Comprehensive and Total Rehabilitation of GAgP Patients with the Current Treatment Modalities\n\n【126】For more details see Figure 14.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 14 | The treatment commences with a nonsurgical phase following which psychotherapy sessions are started for the needy patients, and patients are put on maintenance therapy/supportive periodontal therapy thereafter. While the patient is on maintenance therapy, one or more of the 3 modalities of surgical periodontal therapy can be performed depending upon the indication and once periodontium has been stabilized, an interdisciplinary treatment for the restoration of lost teeth and correction of cosmetic problems is completed following which the patient continues for a “lifelong” maintenance therapy. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【128】#### 8\\. Conclusion\n\n【129】Even though the prevalence of aggressive periodontitis is much lower than chronic periodontitis, the management of aggressive periodontitis is more challenging compared to that of chronic periodontitis because of its strong genetic predisposition as an unmodifiable risk factor. Researchers are going on employing the potential several novel technologies in regenerating the lost periodontium including tissue engineering and genetic engineering.\n\n【130】The key to successful management at present lies in early diagnosis of the disease and rigorous treatment employing the different treatment modalities mentioned in the paper along with systemic antibiotic therapy followed by meticulous lifelong maintenance therapy. With the current treatment modalities, successful long-term maintenance of the dentition in a healthy and functional state can be achieved. A comprehensive periodontal treatment consisting of mechanical/surgical and systemic antimicrobial therapy is found to be an appropriate treatment regimen for long-term stabilization of periodontal health with arrest of periodontal disease progression in 95% of the initially compromised lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[107\\]</u>.\n\n【131】Further understanding of the etiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and host immune response in aggressive periodontitis along with advances in regenerative concepts, tissue engineering, and gene therapy is needed for formulating better management protocols in the treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Clinical B<sub>12</sub> deficiency with hematological or neurological manifestations is rare. An unusual manifestation of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytosis and only occurs in 2.5% of those with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Pseudo-TMA is misdiagnosed as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in 40% of cases, resulting in misguided treatment including plasmapheresis. Case. A 44-year-old Hispanic presented with 3 weeks of progressively worsening non-radiating chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath (SOB). Laboratory findings revealed severe pancytopenia and macrocytosis with a hemoglobin of 5.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 116.3 fL, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> low at 149 pg/mL. She was diagnosed with pseudo-TMA and after starting 1000 micrograms of parenteral vitamin B<sub>12</sub> injections daily and discontinuing plasmapheresis and steroid administration, she improved. Conclusion. Failure to recognize pseudo-TMA often results in unnecessary treatment with plasmapheresis and delays appropriate treatment with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation. It is therefore extremely important to consider pseudo-TMA as a differential diagnosis in patients that present with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> plays an important role in hematopoiesis and neurological function. Clinical manifestations of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency include megaloblastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis, and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Clinical B<sub>12</sub> deficiency with hematological or neurological manifestations is rare, but subclinical B<sub>12</sub> deficiency has an incidence of 2.5–26% in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Pernicious anemia is the most common cause of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in the world and is caused by anti-intrinsic factor or anti-parietal cell antibodies, resulting in impaired B<sub>12</sub> absorption in the terminal ileum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A rare manifestation of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytosis and only occurs in 2.5% of those with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Due to the rarity of pseudo-TMA, approximately 38.8% of cases are misdiagnosed as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), resulting in misguided treatment including plasmapheresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Here, we present a rare cause of pseudo-TMA caused by B<sub>12</sub> deficiency secondary to undiagnosed pernicious anemia.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 44-year-old Hispanic female with a PMH including insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with 3 weeks of progressively worsening non-radiating chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath (SOB). She stated the chest pain was diffuse and that both the chest pain and SOB were worsened with exertion. She also complained of melena, gum bleeding while brushing her teeth, nausea, and loss of taste, but denied fevers, chills, hemoptysis, weight loss, numbness or tingling, diarrhea, or confusion. She reported no tobacco or illicit drug use but did describe drinking 1-2 glasses of wine per week. Her family history was significant for myelodysplastic syndrome in her mother. Initial vital signs were unremarkable aside from being slightly hypertensive to 138/92. Physical examination revealed an obese body habitus, conjunctival pallor, and multiple ecchymoses on her bilateral lower extremities, but did not reveal hepatosplenomegaly or any neurological deficits.\n\n【6】Laboratory findings revealed severe pancytopenia and macrocytosis, hemoglobin (hgb) of 5.4 g/dL (grams per deciliter) (11.6–15 g/dL), hematocrit of 16.4%, mean corpuscular volume of 116.3 fL, (femtoliters) (80–100 (fL), white blood cell count of 3.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL (cells per microliter) (5.0–10.0 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL), and a platelet count of 28,000/µL (per microliter of blood) (150,000–450,000 platelets/µL. The differential revealed a moderate amount of macrocytes, schistocytes, and teardrop cells. Her troponin I was unremarkable at <0.03 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter), and her comprehensive metabolic panel revealed normal bilirubin level of 1.0 mg/dL (0.1–1.2 mg/dL milligrams per deciliter) and mildly elevated AST to 52 U/L (units per liter) (10–40 U/L). Her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was also elevated at 1,647 IU/L (international units per liter) (140–280 IU/L) and haptoglobin decreased (<30.0 mg/dL) (41–165 mg/dL), and peripheral blood smear showed macrocytic normochromic anemia with severe anisopoikilocytosis, frequent schistocytes, and occasional tear drop cells, and no hypersegmented neutrophils were noted. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no splenomegaly or any evidence of neoplastic disease. Disseminated intravascular coagulation profile revealed a normal prothrombin time test (PT) of 11.2 seconds, normal fibrinogen of 349 mg/dL (200–400 mg/dL), and a slightly reduced activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 24.6 seconds. The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with improvement in hgb to 7.3 g/dL, and hematology was promptly consulted due to concern for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient was started on 100 mg prednisone due to a concern for possible autoimmune hemolytic anemia process and was started on daily plasmapheresis on day 1 of hospitalization.\n\n【7】During the first 2 days of hospitalization, further testing revealed ADAMTS13 level within normal limits at 85% activity, antinuclear antibody (ANA) screen negative, and flow cytometry revealed no paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone. ADAMTS13 is a key metalloproteinase enzyme that functions in regulating clotting. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate levels revealed low B<sub>12</sub> (149 pg/mL) (picograms per milliliter) (190–950 (pg/mL) and a normal folate level at 17.5 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) (3–13 (ng/mL). She had no improvement in her pancytopenia or symptoms with 2 days of plasmapheresis, and decision was made to initiate 1000 mcg (micrograms) of parenteral cyanocobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) injections daily and stop plasmapheresis and steroid administration. The patient’s blood counts in all cell lines began to improve after administration of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and her symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea on exertion improved. To evaluate the cause of her B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, anti-parietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies were collected, and both returned positive. Serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels were elevated at 23 umol/mL (micromoles per milliliter) (normal range: 0.00-0.40 umol/mL) and >50 umol/L (normal range: 5-15 umol/L), respectively. Her final diagnosis was pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathic anemia (pseudo-TMA) secondary to pernicious anemia, and the patient was discharged home with monthly B<sub>12</sub> injections and follow-up in the hematology clinic in 2 months.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin) serves an essential physiological role as a cofactor in DNA/RNA synthesis and homocysteine metabolism. B<sub>12</sub> deficiency can lead to ineffective hematopoiesis and demyelination, which classically presents with pancytopenia, megaloblastic anemia, hypersegmented neutrophils, and dorsal column dysfunction. In adults, the most common etiology is autoimmune pernicious anemia, in which case autoantibodies against the intrinsic factor-B<sub>12</sub> complex impairs absorption. Other causes include inadequate dietary intake, malabsorptive causes, and genetic etiologies. Cobalamin metabolism defect (Cbl C) is an autosomal recessive disorder of intracellular cobalamin processing caused by mutations in Mmachc gene. Generally these inherited defects are diagnosed early in life, and, in fact, many newborn screening programs can detect Cbl C 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【10】In a rare 10% of cases, cobalamin deficiency can present with hemolysis. The pathophysiology is still poorly understood, but two proposed mechanisms involve intermedullary hemolysis and hyperhomocysteinemia. Intermedullary hemolysis occurs due to fragile RBC membranes, which cause them to shear before they reach the peripheral circulation. Elevated homocysteine levels have been shown to downregulate the activity of glutathione peroxidase, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species that damage the endothelium and further lyse the already fragile RBCs. When hemolytic anemia is associated with thrombocytopenia and schistocytes in the setting of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, the triad is termed pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy (PTMA). This is an extremely rare presentation of B12 deficiency that is only seen in 2.5% of cases.\n\n【11】Importantly, the hemolysis seen in cobalamin deficiency occurs in the absence of intravascular platelet aggregates or microthrombi, which is the defining hallmark of a group of disorders termed thrombotic microangiopathies. The most common causes of thrombotic microangiopathies include diffuse intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and hemolytic uremia syndrome (HUS). TTP is of particular importance as it shares the same triad of laboratory findings as PTMA. Fever, neurological findings, and renal damage may also be present in TTP but are not necessarily required for diagnosis. TTP is a medical emergency that is almost always fatal without prompt initiation of treatment. Therefore, up to 39% of PTMA patients are initially misdiagnosed with TTP. This occurred in our clinical case, as our patient was started on empiric plasmapheresis until ADAMTS came back at a normal value and we considered other differentials.\n\n【12】Studies comparing PTMA with TTP have helped elucidate additional differences between the two diagnoses. PTMA is associated with very elevated LDH levels, mild bilirubin elevations, high MCV, low reticulocyte counts, and a Coombs-positive pernicious anemia in a majority of cases. Markedly elevated LDH occurs from hemolysis of nucleated RBCs and would therefore not be expected in TTP as the mature RBCs being lysed are anucleate. Similarly, erythroid progenitors produce smaller amounts of hemoglobin and cause mild bilirubin elevation. Macrocytosis coupled with low reticulocytes is due to ineffective erythropoiesis from B12 deficiency. This combination in particular is suggestive of PTMA as opposed to TTP. Finally, TTP would present with a Coombs-negative anemia as it is not an autoimmune etiology. When looking back at our clinical case, all of these subtle signatures can be seen.\n\n【13】Once the diagnosis of PTMA is made, treatment is B12 supplementation. Most patients respond to therapy with resolution of lab abnormalities and clinical symptoms.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】Pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy is an extremely rare clinical manifestation of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency that results from shearing of red blood cells (RBCs) in the absence of microthrombi due to inherent RBC fragility. In contrast to thrombotic microangiopathies, reticulocyte count is low in pseudo-TMA due to limited B<sub>12</sub> reserves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Given the rarity of the disease, pseudo-TMA is often not considered early in the workup of a suspected microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Failure to recognize pseudo-TMA often results in unnecessary treatment with plasmapheresis and delays appropriate treatment with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation. It is therefore extremely important to consider pseudo-TMA as a differential diagnosis in patients that present with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Few case reports have been reported of ITP after COVID-19 infections and COVID-19 vaccines. Herein, we present a patient who presented with severe ITP with a platelet count of 0 after receiving the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (also known as the Pfizer BioNTech). She subsequently recovered with a prolonged treatment course.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a clinical condition where the platelet count is less than 100,000/μL and is associated with petechiae, bruising, or mucosal bleeding when the platelet count is below 50,000/μL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. ITP may be primary when autoantibodies to platelets cause platelet destruction without an underlying cause, but it is secondary when it is the result of an associated condition that may include medications, infections, malignancies, or autoimmune conditions. Prior reports have indicated that vaccinations such as MMR have resulted in ITP in children and that viral infections such as hepatitis C, HIV, and EBV infection can be associated with ITP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. In this report, we present a patient who presented with severe ITP after receiving the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (also known as the Pfizer BioNTech) and recovered with treatment.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Vignette\n\n【5】A 63-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a rash and easy bruising that started a day after her second dose of BNT162b2 vaccination. The rash was initially noted on both her legs and then spread to the rest of her body. Two days after the second COVID-19 vaccination, the patient noticed a large bruise on her lower back, without prior trauma. In addition, she also noted mild bruising of her tongue but no active bleeding. She reported mild dyspnea after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine 3 weeks earlier and noted similar symptoms soon after her second dose of the vaccine. Dyspnea was not associated with chest pain or leg edema. The patient denied nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, hematemesis, hematochezia, or any abdominal pain. She had a past medical history of COPD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, but no history of liver disease or bleeding tendencies. She was on hypoglycemic agents, antihypertensives, and citalopram, but not on aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed generalized petechiae and subcutaneous bruises on the lower back. Laboratory evaluation showed normocytic anemia, normal white blood cell count, and platelet count was 0/μL. Peripheral blood smear was normal except for decreased platelets without evidence of immature platelets. Figure 1 demonstrates the timeline of the patient’s treatments and her platelet counts.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The timeline of the patient’s treatments and her platelet counts.</u>\n\n【8】Since thrombocytopenia due to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) can occasionally lead to thromboembolism and, given the patient’s initial complaint of dyspnea, with an elevated D-dimer of 0.85, a CT angiogram was ordered. CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism. Subsequent workup including absence of schistocytes on peripheral smear, normal LDH, haptoglobin, and bilirubin levels ruled out MAHA. CT head showed no intracranial bleeding. Table 1 shows the pertinent lab values at admission and after treatment.\n\n【9】Table 1 Laboratory values on admission.\n\n【10】Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), believed to be secondary to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was admitted to the hospital. The patient was started on dexamethasone at 40 mg orally daily for 5 days, as well as IVIG 1 g/kg once daily for a total of two doses. Of note, the patient tested positive for Sjogren’s Ab (SS-A) and scleroderma antibodies. Workup for other causes of thrombocytopenia including hepatitis serology, HIV, EBV, ANA, Smith Ab, RNP ab, anti-Jo1 Ab, anti-dsDNA Ab, anti-centromere, and Sjogren’s ab (SS-B) were negative.\n\n【11】Over the next week, the patient’s vitals and overall health remained stable. Her bruising was gradually improving, with no evidence of bleeding or new bruising. While the clinical picture showed stability, her platelet count showed a very slow response to treatment. Labs showed slowly increasing platelet counts from 0K/μL on day 1, 1K/μL on day 3, 5K/μL on day 5, 15K/μL on day 6, 11K/μL on day 7, and 8K/μL on day 8. Since the thrombocytopenia was refractory to IVIG and a 5-day course of steroids, the patient was started on prednisone therapy daily for a total 9 of doses. She subsequently received two doses of Nplate and one dose of Rituxan. Her platelet count responded and improved to 99K/μL on day 14. She was discharged on a prednisone taper and is scheduled to receive the remaining three doses of Rituxan in the outpatient setting.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】The diagnosis of ITP is generally made after the exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia as well as response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As in our patient with new onset ITP, the temporal association of the onset of symptoms after the BNT162b2 vaccine is significant but cannot be proved causality. An underlying rheumatological process cannot be entirely ruled out, given patient’s mildly positive ANA and positive scleroderma antibodies. A detailed review of the current literature shows that patients have been diagnosed with ITP after COVID-19 vaccination, including some patients with a prior history of ITP and few without prior ITP, as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–14\\]</u>. However, most of the reports have shown ITP occurring after the first dose of vaccine, with few reports after the second dose, as seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7, 9–14\\]</u>. It is also possible that the patient may have had a mild form of ITP after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine but was not symptomatic or not detected at that time.\n\n【14】As most patients with ITP respond well to IVIG and steroids, this is the initial management approach for patients with ITP after the COVID-19 vaccine. If the platelet count remains low, thrombopoietic agents and vincristine may be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Rituximab is generally avoided following COVID-19 vaccination due to the slow onset of action, potential negation of recent vaccine-induced immunity, and the inability to revaccinate for more than 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, it may be administered in refractory cases when the benefits outweigh the risks of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The pathogenesis of ITP is still unclear, but it is believed to be secondary to autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoprotein by the patient’s B cells, or by cytotoxic T cells against platelet precursors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As noted earlier, secondary ITP has been reported following multiple conditions, including vaccinations. Based on a literature review, it may be possible that antibodies directed against an antigen formed by the attachment of vaccine particles to some platelets lead to a reaction involving the rest of the platelets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. There have also been reports of ITP following a COVID-19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 17\\]</u>. Interestingly, all the patients presented with symptoms of subcutaneous or mucosal bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia. In general, platelet counts improve rapidly with steroids, but this was not seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. One speculation regarding the etiology is that an underlying damage to megakaryocytes may have resulted in a lack of platelet production. This could also possibly explain the lack of response to IVIG due to the absence of autoantibodies to platelets. The subsequent improvement after day 14, which included treatment with Nplate, could then have been secondary to the development of a new population of megakaryocytes to reestablish platelet production.\n\n【16】ITP is commonly treated with steroid therapy and IVIG, as in our patient. It is important to highlight that the platelet count responds to therapy with improvement of counts. In some instances, when there are bleeding complications, platelet transfusion may be needed.\n\n【17】In summary, we herein report a unique case of severe ITP likely induced by the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, reiterating that this is a rare and treatable condition that can be diagnosed easily and responds to therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This chronic lymph leakage leads to a state of immunosuppression secondary to the loss of humoral and cellular components of the immune system and represents a potential risk factor for opportunistic infections. We report a case of protein-losing enteropathy in a seemingly immunocompetent patient. An intestinal histopathological study revealed the unusual association of lymphangiectasia and intestinal cryptococcosis. Although cryptococcal infection is common in immunocompromised patients, intestinal involvement is rarely reported. We found no reports on the association of intestinal cryptococcosis in patients with lymphangiectasia. This case report is the first to describe intestinal cryptococcosis associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case\n\n【3】A 37-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain exacerbation of 3 hours of evolution associated diarrhea with melena. The patient had a documented medical history of intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea over the 6 months prior to the current admission. Upon admission, the patient presented febrile and in anasarca, with major edema in lower limbs. Initial blood work showed moderate microcytic anemia (Hb 10.3 g/dl, Hct. 23.7%, and MCV 75 fL), severe hypoalbuminemia (1.7 g/dL), inversion of albumin/globulin ratio, and CBC did not show signs of infection.\n\n【4】The patient was started on protein replenishment with human albumin which resolved partially the edema.\n\n【5】An exhaustive workout was performed to identify the underlying cause of the edema and low protein levels. Liver disease was ruled out due to normal liver profile (total bilirubin 0.21 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 0.11 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.10 mg/dL, AST 9 IU/L, and ALT 8 IU/L) and the negative liver ultrasound. Nephrotic syndrome was also ruled out as a possible diagnosis.\n\n【6】Due to the persistence of abdominal pain, structural damage or tumor processes were investigated; however, abdominal CT only showed edema in the small intestine wall suggesting chronic enteropathy.\n\n【7】Although the patient was considered initially immunocompetent, there was a significant drop in complement C3 0.5 g/L (negative <0.8 g/L) and C4 0.03 g/L (negative <0.10 g/L). Further laboratory testing showed hypogammaglobulinemia (22 mg/dL IgA (normal 22–149 mg/dL), 150 mg/dL IgG (normal 615–1530 mg/dL), 20 mg/dL IgM (normal 31–272 mg/dL)), and 20 mL/24 hrs α\\-1 antitrypsin clearance.\n\n【8】An upper digestive endoscopy was performed showing a whitish lace pattern and erythematous walls in the second portion of the duodenum. In addition, a colonoscopy showed hemorrhoidal packages, multiple ulcerated lesions in sigma, and elevated, pseudopolypoid, infiltrative lesions in cecum and ileocecal valve.\n\n【9】Since our patient lived in a tuberculosis endemic area and that the lesions simulated intestinal tuberculosis, empirical antituberculosis therapy (isoniazid 75 mg, rifampicin 150 mg, ethambutol 275 mg, and pyrazinamide 400 mg) was started until biopsy results came back.\n\n【10】Multiple cryptococci were found in samples taken from the cecum, sigma, and ileocecal valve using the techniques of immunohistochemistry CD68, Grocott stain, PAS stain, and Alcian blue stain . In addition, the presence of intestinal lymphangiectasia was confirmed with D240 staining .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Macrophages loaded with cryptococcal spores (arrowhead): (a) PAS staining, (b) Grocott staining, (c) Alcian blue staining, and (d) immunohistochemistry CD68.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Histopathological biopsy study obtained from the lower gastrointestinal tract.

Due to the severity of the presentation octreotide was started along with dietary treatment. Octreotide and oral fluconazole 600 mg were maintained for 90 days after discharge with favorable symptomatic evolution, additionally, following laboratory controls shown that albumin levels went back to normal.\n\n【14】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Cryptococcosis is one of the most frequent opportunistic fungal diseases. Its incidence in Latin America has been increasing, reaching approximately 5300 cases in 2017. However, intestinal dissemination is rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】An exhaustive literature review in the Medline databases was performed using the terms “gastrointestinal cryptococcosis” and “intestinal lymphangiectasia.” We identified a total of 10 case reports of intestinal cryptococcosis in the context of immunosuppressing conditions which are summarized in Table 1; however, we were unable to find reports similar to our case. The lack of literature on the coalescence of these conditions suggests that this work is the first description of intestinal cryptococcosis associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia.\n\n【17】Table 1 Case reports of intestinal cryptococcosis in the context of immunosuppressing conditions.\n\n【18】The countries with the highest incidence of common presentations of Cryptococcosis are Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The infection occurs through contact with soil or eucalyptus trees contaminated with birds’ feces. Most of these cases occur in young male patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, and in much lesser proportion in immunocompetent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The infection involves the central nervous system (CNS) in almost 70% of cases, being the most common cause of meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients. Lung involvement is the second most common presentation and presents as infiltrations or granulomatous reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The increasing prevalence of patients diagnosed with AIDS has been proportional to the increase in opportunistic infections such as Cryptococcosis. The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has modified its presentation, resulting in atypical locations. Intestinal cryptococcosis is believed to be through direct inoculation rather than hematogenous dissemination since blood cultures were always negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The apparent immunocompetence of our patient and his unspecific symptomatology made his diagnosis a real challenge, misguiding the diagnostic suspicion towards more common gastrointestinal tract infections such as tuberculosis. Similar situations happened in a large number of reported cases of intestinal cryptococcosis, in which diagnosis occurred incidentally.\n\n【22】Out of 11 case reports of gastrointestinal cryptococcosis, only Sciaudone G presented an immunocompetent patient while the rest reported immunologically compromised patients. The correlation between immunocompromised and intestinal cryptococcosis is well documented. Patients with advanced stages of HIV (CD4 < 200), with malignant processes (solid or hematological tumors), treatment with immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>, organ-transplanted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, or cirrhotic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 12\\]</u> are considered as high-risk subjects.\n\n【23】Intestinal lymphangiectasia can produce a state of secondary immunodeficiency. The pathological dilation of lymphatic vessels in the intestinal wall, especially in the submucosa, causes chronic loss of lymph containing immunoglobulins and lymphocytes (predominantly naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells) and severe hypoalbuminemia. This state of secondary immunodeficiency is of difficult diagnosis and poses a high risk for opportunistic fungal infections such as cryptococcosis, as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Our patient’s age was accord with the average age of intestinal cryptococcosis presentation reported in the literature (37 years, ranging from 26 to 73 years) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Abdominal pain was the most common initial symptom in patients infected with Cryptococcus. The onset of pain in reported cases ranged from 2 days to 6 months; however, the majority exceeded 3 weeks. In addition, 66% of patients had fever at some point in the course of the illness associated with vomiting and nausea sporadically. Despite being an invasive intestinal pathology, only half of the patients had diarrhea, and only 25% had bloody diarrhea or melena. Any gastrointestinal organ can be affected.\n\n【26】Through endoscopy, suggestive lesions, as ulcers or abscesses, and signs of inflammation can be evidenced. However, ulcers can be similar to those produced in malignancy, other infections (Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania donovani, etc.), or Crohn’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 7, 11, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Although management varies depending on the localization of infection, fluconazole 400 to 800 mg once daily for 8 weeks followed by medium doses for 12 months can be used empirically. Intravenous amphotericin B is considered as the first line of treatment for disseminated Cryptococcus; however, its use in gastrointestinal cryptococcosis is not well studied (F. Cicora) (Rupashree Sundar).\n\n【28】The cryptococcal infection had high mortality rates in immunocompromised patients; however, it is important to consider that in the majority of reports the patient’s general condition was already severely compromised due to the advanced state of the underlying disease prior to infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms of COVID-19. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly known to progress more rapidly than other symptoms and can occur in cases of mild infection or even after remission of the viral infection. Acute pancreatitis (AP) caused by COVID-19 is one of the rare gastrointestinal symptoms which is an acute inflammatory disease of the pancreas that is associated with high complications. Here, we report acute COVID-19-induced pancreatitis in a 38-year-old man who died.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), is an ongoing global epidemic that has affected millions of people and has become a serious public health problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although respiratory symptoms, including fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, are the most common, gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations of COVID-19 are also increasingly recognized, with diarrhea being the most common manifestations of GI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common disease, being the gastrointestinal disease most frequently requiring acute hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

With the advent of the COVID-19 epidemic, several cases of AP have been reported following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we report a case of AP with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection without other risk factors for pancreatitis.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 38-year-old male with a chief complaint of nausea and severe epigastric pain with radiation to the back area was referred to the emergency room in Hamedan hospital. The patient was admitted to the hospital one week ago due to COVID-19 pneumonia with significant lung involvement (85 O<sub>2</sub> saturation (Sat)) , so medical therapy with remdesivir (200 mg stat dose and then 100 mg Q12 hr) and dexamethasone (8 mg Q12 hr) was received just in hospital admission. The patient during hospital admission improved and was discharged without any complications and medications, but one week after discharge from the hospital, he suddenly developed severe epigastric pain that radiated to the back area and nausea, so he has referred to the hospital again.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Lung CT scan of the patient at previous admission shows moderate involvement of the patient’s lungs.</u>\n\n【8】Past and personal history was normal.

Fluid therapy with ringer lactate and antibiotic therapy (meropenem 500 mg Q12 h) was started, but the patient gradually developed a decreased level of consciousness and shock state and decreased O<sub>2</sub> saturation. We did not have the opportunity for surgery to resect the necrotic tissues because the patient was in shock and did not respond despite supportive treatment, and the patient’s condition did not stabilize. The patient underwent mechanical ventilation and supportive care, but his condition deteriorated and expired after one day.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Computed tomography scan of the abdomen showing necrotic areas (hypoenhancing, nonenhancing) in the body of the pancreas.</u>\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】AP is an acute inflammatory disease of the pancreas associated with high morbidity. Vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain are common presentations of acute pancreatitis. It can be diagnosed by the presence of epigastric pain and tenderness to palpitation and abnormal increase of pancreatic enzymes (amylase or lipase) more than the three-time above the normal limit and/or imaging criteria (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our patient, AP presented with epigastric pain and nausea, and laboratory findings and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of AP. We were also able to exclude potential causes of AP, including alcoholism, drugs, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, Hep B and HIV infection, previous attacks or family history, and trauma, based on the patient’s history and tests.\n\n【15】Previously, Müller et al. isolated the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in beta cells and pancreatic exocrine cells in postmortem patients and found that SARS-CoV-2 could infect and proliferate in the pancreatic islets of the Langerhans Islands and cause infection-related diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Although ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, which are involved in virus binding and penetration, express more in pancreatic outlet cells than in pancreatic islet cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, for SARS-CoV-2, it is unclear whether tissue damage leading to AP occurs as a result of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> or as a result of systemic multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with increased levels of lipase which leads to the breakdown of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue cells and the formation of cytokine storms as a result of the toxic effect of unsaturated fatty acids on mitochondria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> or following coagulation cascade activation caused by active inflammatory process due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this case, AP is associated with increased fibrinolysis resulting in higher levels of D-dimers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The patient’s condition after an AP attack is directly related to the severity of the pancreatitis SIRS reaction. One of the scaling systems for the severity of pancreatitis at the onset of symptoms is the Ranson scoring system, which is clinically efficient and useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It is evaluated using clinical and laboratory variables at the time of patient referral to the hospital. Five variables are measured at admission (age, WBC count, glucose, LDH, and AST) and six variables are measured within 48 hours (Hct drop, BUN increase, calcium, arterial pO2, base deficit, and, fluid sequestration). A Ranson score of 0 or 1 predicts that complications will not develop and that mortality will be negligible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. A score of 3 or greater predicts severe AP and possible mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In our patient, there were 5 variables of Ranson’s criteria . It should be noted that serum amylase or lipase levels are only indicative of acinar cell damage and have nothing to do with the severity of pancreatitis or the likelihood of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Table 2 Ranson criteria for our patient.\n\n【18】CT scan is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of AP and also provides prognostic information to the physician. Baltazar et al. developed a grading system based on CT scan findings that included 5 grades: A (normal pancreas), B (enlargement of pancreas), C (inflammatory changes in pancreas and peripancreatic fat), D (ill-defined single peripancreatic fluid collection), and E (two or more poorly defined peripancreatic fluid collections), that our patient was in grade E 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It is important to understand that the severity of AP is not fixed. Therefore, a CT scan at any point in time does not accurately reflect the severity of the disease at another point in time, and in some cases, such as AP caused by SIRS, a series of CT scans are needed to control and monitor the course of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【19】To reduce pancreatic secretion, discontinue oral feeding until pain and tenderness resolve and serum amylase and white blood cell count (WBC) return to normal. In severe cases such as our patient, several liters of the isotonic solution are needed to resuscitate the patient, so maintaining adequate tissue perfusion by monitoring hemodynamic parameters and maintaining adequate intravascular volume is very important. Therefore, electrolytes and blood glucose need direct control. Various studies have also shown that all pharmacological efforts to reduce pancreatic secretion, including anticholinergic drugs, somatostatin analogs, antacids, and aprotinin, have no significant benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【20】In acute pancreatitis, respiratory function is carefully monitored by pulse oximetry because fluid accumulation within the pleural space and atelectasis interferes with the rise of the respiratory diaphragm. In some cases, the use of a ventilator is also required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a small vessel vasculitis characterized by lung and kidney involvement. It is typically a disease of white females and has a poor prognosis with the average life expectancy of 5 months for a patient without treatment. Oral and skin ulcers are considered to be rare presentations. Case. A 39-year-old black male presented to the hospital with oral and skin ulcers and was diagnosed with GPA based on the biopsies of both cutaneous lesions and kidney. He was started on rituximab with minimal improvement. Later he was admitted to the ICU and had plasmapheresis, and he gradually improved and was discharged home 8 days after admission. Conclusion. GPA is an aggressive vascular disorder resulting in possible organ system damage and failure. The role of the sickle cell trait in this patient is undefined, but this combination of gender, race, and presenting symptoms in GPA is extremely unusual.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis, is a small vessel vasculitis with systemic manifestations. This disease is characterized by upper and lower respiratory granulomatous inflammation with or without renal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is part of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated small vessel vasculitis which includes Churg–Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, and renal-limited vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. GPA is a rare disease with a prevalence of 3 cases per 100,000 in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The localized form of the disease is predominant in young females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, peaking in the fourth and sixth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. GPA can present as a generalized disease or limited disease. The generalized disease can involve any organ while the localized form is usually limited to lungs, eyes, or ears, but other organs can be involved including the heart. Generalized symptoms such as fever and malaise may be present. Pulmonary symptoms include cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. Renal involvement is usually late and is associated with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Oral mucosa lesions occur in 6–50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Currently, the diagnosis of GPA is based on clinical, serological, and histological findings.\n\n【4】The diagnosis is aided by the presence of serum antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody. In the generalized disease, ANCA can be seen in 80–95% of the patients, but in limited presentations, ANCA can be detected in a range of 60%–80%. If clinical suspicion is high with a negative ANCA test, obtaining a tissue sample for histopathology is required for definitive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our case, we present a male who is seen in the emergency department with cutaneous lesions as the initial presentation of GPA. Our patient initially presented without pulmonary or renal involvement and was diagnosed with GPA following biopsies of oral and cutaneous lesions.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 39-year-old black male with known sickle cell trait presented to the emergency department with lower extremity swelling with blisters and odynophagia. He developed petechial lesions on both feet that progressed to ulcers  on the bilateral lower extremities. The odynophagia started 2 weeks prior to presentation and was associated with a tongue ulcer. He had been evaluated by an infectious disease team during a previous visit and had an unrevealing workup. He was not on any treatment for lower extremity lesions. He denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, night sweats, recent travel, and history of IV drug use.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Ulcer on third and fifth toes .</u>\n\n【8】His initial vital signs were BP 156/86, HR 114, temperature 102.2 F, and O<sub>2</sub> saturation at 98% on room air. Physical exam was remarkable for oral thrush with right tongue ulceration and healing ulcers on the dorsal surface of his feet bilaterally. His complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic profile (BMP) were within normal limits. Urinalysis was positive for blood and 2+ proteinuria. His urine toxicology was positive for oxycodone. He was initially treated for Systemic Inflammatory Response System (SIRS). Blood cultures were drawn and he was started empirically on vancomycin and piperacillin and tazobactam. Bilateral venous duplex was negative for deep vein thrombosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed multiple irregular nodules with suspected infectious versus inflammatory etiology and septic emboli could not be excluded . Transthoracic echocardiogram was negative for infective endocarditis. Bilateral foot ulcers drained serosanguinous fluid with cultures positive for Enterococcus faecalis and Serratia but four sets of blood cultures remained negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left foot was normal and MRI of the right foot showed metatarsal stress reaction versus early osteomyelitis. Skin biopsy showed extensively necrotic fibroadipose tissue with acute inflammation. Right lateral oral tongue ulcerative lesion biopsy showed predominantly hyperplastic squamous mucosa showing an ulcer site and abscess with fragments of necrotic squamous epithelium associated with cytologic atypia and colonies of bacteria, and one fragment of necrotic squamous epithelium displayed vague papillary architecture. The patient later developed right eye conjunctivitis. Appropriate consultations with nephrology, pulmonology, and podiatry were obtained.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CT imaging showing multiple irregular pulmonary nodules (arrow) at different levels. The morphology of these nodules favors infectious/inflammatory nodules more than malignancy. Vasculitis can also have this appearance.</u>\n\n【10】Based on the constellation of oral and cutaneous ulcers, CT chest findings, bilateral foot ulcers, and conjunctivitis, a rheumatologic process was suspected. The antinuclear antibody (ANA) was negative, rheumatoid factor was with 1 : 640 titer, C-ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) was positive with 1 : 1280 titer, and the diagnosis of Wegner’s granulomatosis was made. He was started on rituximab 375 mg weekly and methylprednisolone 250 mg every 6 hours for 3 days. He later had a renal biopsy which showed granulomatosis with polyangiitis and mild interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy and a pauci immune crescentic glomerulonephritis . He underwent debridement of his bilateral foot ulcers and received an additional dose of rituximab. Following the second dose of rituximab, the oral ulcers improved. Toward the end of his hospitalization, his hemoglobin decreased and he was noted to have blood streaked sputum. Repeat CT chest was ordered and was consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage . Unfortunately, he left prior to pulmonology evaluation. He was called and encouraged to come back to the hospital but declined and ultimately sought further medical attention at another hospital where he was ultimately admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Nephrology was consulted and began plasmapheresis for a total of 7 treatments. He was given a one-time dose of cyclophosphamide on initial presentation and then an additional dose of rituximab following plasmapheresis. He gradually improved and was discharged home 8 days after admission.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Light microscopy of a renal biopsy with multiple cores of renal tissue, of which approximately 40% is represented by cortex.

Discussion\n\n【15】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis was first described in 1936 by Wegener 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. GPA was defined by the 2012 Chapel Hill consensus as necrotizing inflammatory vasculitis affecting mainly the small to medium vessels of the upper and lower respiratory tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Gubbels et al. reported that GPA affects a wide age range with a mean age of diagnosis of 40 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. GPA can affect all racial groups but is seen predominantly among Caucasian people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The typical diagnostic criteria were first described by Goldman and Churg in 1954. This includes upper and lower respiratory tract necrotizing granulomas, glomerulonephritis, and systemic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The American College of Rheumatology established criteria for GPA in 1990 which include abnormal urinary sediment, chest radiograph abnormalities, oral ulcers or nasal discharge, and biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The earliest symptoms of the disease are often important clues that guide toward the diagnosis. Kihiczak published a case report in 1994 describing a 36-year-old woman who was diagnosed with sarcoidosis after having conjunctival and nasal mucosal biopsy. Later on, after a prolonged course of symptoms, she was ultimately properly diagnosed with atypical GPA with granulomatous ulcers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Figarella also described a patient who had recurrent nodular lesions on the legs and biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation. Ten years later, pulmonary symptoms developed and a repeat skin biopsy revealed granulomatous vasculitis as the underlying cause for the cutaneous and pulmonary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. While skin lesions occur in 14–50% of patients with GPA, there are no specific cutaneous symptoms for the disease. Lesions can include palpable purpura, skin nodules, skin ulcers, and livedo reticularis. Palpable purpura can be considered as the most common skin manifestation with a prevalence of 35% among patients with GPA and 74% among dermatological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A very rare cutaneous manifestation is pyoderma gangrenosum, defined by skin necrosis and deep ulcers. Kędzierska et al. published a treatment-resistant case that was treated with dapsone and steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Sinovich and Snow also presented a case of a patient with right infra-auricular noduloulcerative lesion that progressed to a periauricular pyoderma gangrenosum that was completely resolved with steroids and azathioprine therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Duna et al. reported that 6–13% of patients with GPA have oral lesions with 2% only have it as a presenting feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. This was one of our patient’s presenting complaints making this case somewhat unusual. The combination of “strawberry gingivitis” with a biopsy showing pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, microabscesses, and multinucleated giant cells with severe systemic symptoms can be diagnostic for GPA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. There have been few reports showing that GPA can affect parotid, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Tongue necrosis is a rare oral symptom with only two previously reported cases. The first one was by Bachmeyer et al. who published a case of necrotic lingual ulceration that was resolved with immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The second was by Rodgers et al. with a case of bilateral tongue infarction with a severe and rapidly progressive form of GPA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Early diagnosis is important. The aim of treating GPA early on is to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease as the average life expectancy is only 5 months for a patient without treatment with a 1-year survival rate <20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Treatment of GPA is multidisciplinary between different subspecialties in order to treat the different organs that are involved in the disease process. Treatment with corticosteroid alone was found to double the life expectancy to about 12 months with a 1-year survival of 34% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Treatment with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid therapy has resulted in remission and increased survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Azathioprine, while less effective than cyclophosphamide, has shown some success and should be considered in patients with adverse effects to cyclophosphamide or when patients have fertility concerns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Methotrexate, used in limited GPA, is less likely to achieve and sustain remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD20 antigen on B cells and may be important in prevention of disease relapse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In conclusion, GPA should be considered in the differential among patients who present with skin and oral ulcers compatible with pyoderma gangrenosum that develop worsening of renal indices. Due to the morbidity and mortality associated with the condition, early diagnosis is important. A multidisciplinary approach with close communication between a renal team and primary care physician team is important to achieve the best outcomes. This role of the sickle cell trait in this patient is undefined, but this combination of gender, race, and presenting symptoms in GPA is extremely unusual.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

During the first-trimester ultrasonography of the unborn patient, an increased thickness of the nuchal fold was detected. The mother reported decreased foetal movements during the pregnancy. After the boy was born, his general condition was extremely severe. The clinical signs indicated a suspected neuromuscular disorder. A precise diagnosis, type 0 SMA, was determined 7 days after birth through a newborn pilot-screening for SMA, which was conducted for all newborns whose parents consented to participate. The condition of the infant deteriorated. He had severe respiratory distress followed by multiple events leading to his death. Currently, there are only a few published case reports detailing an increased nuchal translucency (NT) measurement in association with a diagnosis of SMA in the foetus. However, an increased NT measurement is a clinically relevant sign as it can be related to genetic syndromes, foetal malformations, disruptions, and dysplasias. Since there is no cure for infants with type 0 SMA at present, it is crucial to be able to detect this disease prenatally in order to provide the best possible care for the patient and parents. This includes the provision of palliative care for the patient, among other measures. This case report highlights the prenatal signs and symptoms in relation to type 0 SMA.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Spinal muscular atrophy 5q (SMA5q) is a genetic disease characterised by the degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common cause is the deletion of exon 7 in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. The severity of the disease correlates with the number of copies of the survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The SMN protein is synthesized by two genes: SMN1 and SMN2. In each cell, there are typically two copies of the SMN1 gene and one or two copies of the SMN2 gene. The number of SMN2 gene copies can vary, with some individuals having up to eight copies. Although the SMN2 and SMN1 genes produce proteins that are identical, only a small fraction of functional protein, about 10 to 15 percent, is synthesized by the SMN2 gene, with the majority being produced by the SMN1 gene. Therefore, the number of SMN2 gene copies a person has can significantly impact the amount of SMN protein they can generate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】According to available data, the incidence of the disease in Latvia is 1/9,091 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As of 2021, the population of Latvia was approximately 1.89 million people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, with 17,420 live births recorded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.

The global incidence of spinal muscular atrophy is about 1 in 10,000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The carrier frequency worldwide is around 1 in 35 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Patients in Latvia that are diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy have two treatment options: risdiplam and nusinersen. Nusinersen received European approval in June 2017 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> and became accessible in Latvia by July 2019. More recently, risdiplam received European approval in February 2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and became accessible in Latvia by February 2022.\n\n【5】The disease is classified into five types depending on the age of onset and the clinical course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The most severe type is SMA type 0, and the least severe is SMA type 4 . SMA type 0 manifests prenatally. Mothers of affected children can experience a decrease or even a loss of foetal movements during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In addition, foetuses may present with intrauterine growth retardation, pulmonary hypoplasia, and skeletal abnormalities. Newborns with SMA type 0 have a severe muscle weakness and hypotonia at birth. They often present with areflexia, congenital heart defects, and facial diplegia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Affected infants are not able to achieve any motor function milestones. Most babies die by one month of age due to respiratory failure.

Case Presentation\n\n【8】This case report presents the first registered patient in Latvia with type 0 SMA. The index case was a male infant from nonconsanguineous parents. The mother was a 33-year-old Caucasian female. She did not smoke and had no health issues. The father was a 35-year-old Caucasian male with no chronic illnesses. There was no positive family history of SMA; however, both parents were carriers of a mutated SMN1 gene. The index patient was their second baby. The previous pregnancy was uneventful, and a healthy child was born. Thus far, no SMA5q symptoms have been reported.\n\n【9】The mother’s pregnancy with the proband was considered high risk due to her age. Consequently, several ultrasonographic parameters (thickness of foetal nuchal translucency (NT), nasal bone length, tricuspid valve and ductus venosus dopplerometry, and foetal heart rate) were assessed, as were maternal serum biochemical parameters. Chorionic villus sampling was performed as a precautionary measure due to the increased risk of aneuploidy, changes observed in ultrasound readings, and maternal age.\n\n【10】During the first-trimester ultrasonography, an increased thickness of the nuchal fold (7.9 mm; <2.5 mm or <95<sup>th</sup> percentile, places the pregnancy at a low risk; ≥6.5 mm, places the pregnancy at a high risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>) was detected as well as a cystic hygroma. No heart defects were detected. Chorionic villus sampling excluded common chromosomal aneuploidies by quantitative fluorescent PCR. Furthermore, chromosomal microarray analysis did not show any pathological variations. The mother reported reduced foetal movements throughout the pregnancy, especially during the third trimester. Despite a normal chromosomal microarray analysis result, a high index of suspicion for genetic pathology was maintained in view of abnormal ultrasonographic findings. However, extensive panel genetic testing using next-generation sequencing or exome sequencing was not performed as it is not a routine prenatal test in Latvia.\n\n【11】The patient was born at 36<sup>+1</sup> weeks of gestational age. Due to pelvic presentation, followed by an external cephalic version and bradycardia, an acute caesarean section was performed. The weight of the neonate was 2,950 grams (17<sup>th</sup> percentile) and the length was 50 cm (52<sup>nd</sup> percentile). The head circumference was 35 cm (66<sup>th</sup> percentile).\n\n【12】After the birth, the general condition of the infant was extremely severe. The patient had severe asphyxia during labour. Primary resuscitation was initiated, comprising tactile stimulation, upper airway suctioning, and ventilation. The patient had severe respiratory distress, no active movements, atonia, and areflexia, and his skin was cyanotic. The Apgar scores were 1/1/2/3. To provide ventilatory support, intubation was required in the first minute after birth; however, the patient’s condition deteriorated, and so mechanical ventilation was implemented. The patient experienced a femur fracture and newborn hypoglycemia and was later diagnosed with an atrial septal defect.\n\n【13】To identify the cause of the infant’s severe condition, TORCH infections were checked for and excluded, a head MRI was performed, and a geneticist was consulted. The head MRI results reported multiple ischaemic foci in the frontal and parietal lobes and in the basal ganglia. Based on the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms, the geneticist suspected SMA. The parents consented to newborn screening for SMA5q and 7 days after birth, a homozygous deletion of exon 7 in the SMN1 gene was reported. Further genetic analysis as part of the Latvian newborn screening protocol detected 0 copies of the SMN1 gene and 1 copy of the SMN2 gene. A diagnosis of type 0 SMA was confirmed.\n\n【14】Ten days after their son’s birth, a multidisciplinary team informed the parents about his type 0 SMA diagnosis. They were informed about the limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Following a full discussion, the parents decided against invasive mechanical ventilation, and the infant was extubated. Rapid desaturation, bradycardia, and cardiac arrest followed and the patient died.\n\n【15】The concluding diagnoses of the neonate were as follows: type 0 SMA, severe asphyxia during labour, femur fracture, atrial septal defect, and newborn hypoglycemia.\n\n【16】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【17】We report here the case of a newborn with type 0 SMA. At the first-trimester ultrasonography, an increased NT thickness was detected. After birth, the patient had severe respiratory distress followed by multiple events leading to a fatal outcome.\n\n【18】Currently, the identification of SMA-affected infants prior to the presentation of clinical symptoms is accomplished by newborn screening. However, the severity of this disorder highlights the importance of prenatal detection.\n\n【19】NT thickness evaluation is associated with multiple foetal malformations, genetic syndromes, intrauterine death risk, congenital heart defects, and a high risk of miscarriage. Most of the structural anomalies are undetectable prior to childbirth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. There are only a few published case reports of an increased NT measurement in association with a diagnosis of SMA type 0 in the foetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The study by Parra et al. explored the correlation between increased NT in SMA foetuses and the severity of the disease. The findings suggested that a thickened NT is an infrequent occurrence in most foetuses that are affected by SMA, but it may indicate the relevance of SMN2 copy number in the development of congenital heart defects and elevated NT values. The research highlighted the significance of early echocardiography to monitor at-risk foetuses and detect potential complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. In some cases, it may present with multiple health issues, as evidenced by our case involving a newborn diagnosed with SMA type 0. The index case also had severe asphyxia during labour, femur fracture, atrial septal defect, and newborn hypoglycemia, illustrating the complexity and severity of type 0 SMA and its associated complications.\n\n【21】It is well established that an increased NT thickness is predictive value for an adverse pregnancy outcome, even if conventional karyotyping is normal. The risk of foetal malformations is proportional to the NT thickness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Specifically, if the enlargement is between 3.5 and 4.4 mm, the risk of a foetal chromosome abnormality is 21%, rising to 33% if it is 5 mm, 50% if it is 6 mm, and 65% if it is greater than 6.5 mm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. However, multiple studies have shown no association between an increased NT thickness and the diagnosis of SMA, suggesting that SMA-affected foetuses have normal NT thickness values. For instance, a study by Zadeh et al. investigated 12 SMA-affected infants with confirmed NT thickness results during pregnancy. All the foetuses had normal NT thickness values ranging from 0.7 to 2.4 mm, implying the SMA is not associated with an enlarged NT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Barone and Bianca examining 29 women proposed that foetal genetic testing of the SMN1 gene on the basis of increased NT thickness is not indicated in couples with no previous history of SMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the findings of Parra et al. support the idea that SMN2 gene copy number in SMA foetuses is relevant for the development of congenital heart defects and increased NT thickness values 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【22】A broad range of options is needed to help diagnose SMA prenatally. The gold standard for SMA diagnosis is multiplex ligation probe analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>, a targeted test. However, as an increased NT thickness is not currently considered a sign of SMA, this would not have been employed in the case described here. If the signs are not clear, then prenatally the best next-generation sequencing method is exome sequencing; however, it requires specific bioinformatic analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>, as SMN1 and SMN2 are genes with high homology. If a neuromuscular disorder is suspected, then targeted neuromuscular disease panels can be used, as described by Zhao et al. and Tan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28, 29\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The mother’s observation of decreased foetal movements served as an additional indication of potential pathology for the unborn child. Nonetheless, research suggests that only in rare cases are reduced foetal movements associated with foetal neuromuscular disorders. In our case, the reduced movements suggested that the symptoms of a neuromuscular disorder were already present before birth. Studies show that in cases of SMA type 0, reduced foetal movements are typically experienced between 30 and 36 weeks of gestation and are associated with a markedly restricted lifespan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The findings reported by Grotto et al. regarding the clinical manifestations of SMA type 0 are consistent with those observed in the patient presented in our report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The importance of early diagnosis and management of the disease is enhanced. As noted by Andrea et al. the lack of a specific and proven treatment for SMA type 0 underscores the need for further research in this area. Well-designed studies are necessary to assess potential treatments. In the meantime, healthcare providers should focus on providing appropriate palliative care and genetic counseling to affected families. Early diagnosis, preferably even before birth, can aid in the provision of optimal care to patients with SMA type 0 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The reported cases of type 0 SMA have been ventilator dependent and have ultimately passed away in the neonatal period after ventilation support was withdrawn, usually at the request of parents. Our case was no different. The infant was ventilator-dependent and passed away after ventilation support was withdrawn at the request of the parents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 31, 32\\]</u>.\n\n【26】In rare cases, type 0 SMA can be accompanied by additional features, known as SMA plus. A case report by Gathwala et. al shed light on a case of SMA type 0 in combination with a Dandy–Walker variant, which was confirmed through molecular genetic analysis that revealed the homozygous deletion of exon 7 of the SMN1 gene. After the patient was born, a CT scan was conducted. It showed partial vermian hypoplasia and partial obstruction in the fourth ventricle. There was no enlargement observed in the posterior fossa. These results were consistent with a diagnosis of a Dandy–Walker variant. While SMA plus is not uncommon and various additional features have been described, the combination of SMA type 0 with the Dandy–Walker variant is particularly rare. These case studies highlight the need for increased awareness and understanding of the complex nature of SMA and its associated conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\n【27】In the case described here, more comprehensive diagnostic procedures should have been performed to try and identify the cause of the abnormal NT result prenatally. This information would have given the parents the option of terminating the pregnancy. In addition, carrying out a more thorough evaluation to determine the cause of decreased foetal movements, along with the abnormal NT result, would have led to improved patient care and enhanced support for the parents. Such care could have included palliative care for the baby and enhanced psychological support for the parents. However, a major consideration in this case was the financial support provided by the parents’ health insurance, which did not allow for extensive diagnostic procedures.\n\n【28】Innovative treatments have been developed for patients with SMA. However, the treatment options for type 0 SMA patients are limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. These patients require respiratory and feeding support, which typically is not enough to keep the patients alive. A recent case report from Matesanz et al. described the clinical course of a patient with type 0 SMA who was treated with nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec. Although the infant had modest motor improvements, she also had continued systemic complications from her SMA, thus highlighting the challenges of treating patients with more severe phenotypes of SMA. Nevertheless, the possibility that the genetic treatment had a positive effect compared to the original course of the disease cannot be denied. Similar to our case, this patient had multiple medical conditions that were related to their underlying issue, including cardiac abnormalities such as atrial and ventricular septal defects. Studies propose that individuals with a lower copy number of SMN2 and a more severe phenotype of spinal muscular atrophy are more likely to have structural heart malformations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Tiberi et al.‘s case report presented the case of a type 0 SMA patient with 1 copy of the SMN2 gene. At the age of 13 days, the infant received treatment with nusinersen. Although he showed mild motor improvement, he required a tracheostomy at the age of 4 months. An increasing cardiac and autonomic dysfunction followed, and he died at the age of 5 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Therefore, the available data suggest that despite the development of innovative treatments for SMA, they are unlikely to produce a significant positive effect in type 0 patients.\n\n【30】According to a study, the reported incidence of SMA in Latvia is 1 in 9,091 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The first results of a pilot-screening involved an examination of 10,411 patients, resulting in the identification of SMA 5q-positive cases at a frequency of 1 in 5,205 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. However, the duration of the screening period was insufficient to firmly establish this incidence rate. Between December 2021 and April 2023, a pilot screening for SMA was conducted on 26,421 newborns in Latvia. It gave a valuable insight on this condition. Previously unpublished data revealed 3 confirmed cases of SMA, suggesting a slightly higher incidence rate than previously reported. The new findings suggest that the occurrence of SMA in Latvia is approximately 1 out of every 8,807 individuals. As a proactive measure, starting in April 2023, SMA has been integrated into the newborn screening program in Latvia. This holds promising implications and enhances the likelihood of early detection and administration of presymptomatic treatment for newborns affected by spinal muscular atrophy.\n\n【31】Despite the fact that the outcome expectancy of patients with type 0 SMA is pessimistic and the disease leads to early mortality, newborn screening for SMA5q can significantly improve the life expectancy and quality of patients with other types of SMA. There is evidence that presymptomatic treatment initiated as a result of newborn screening improves the outcome of children with genetically proven SMA. Including newborn screening for SMA is vital in order to initiate treatment presymptomatically and obtain the best outcome for patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. In our case, the parents’ other child has not been tested for SMA yet. The child displays no observable indications of a neuromuscular disorder and has not undergone evaluation by a geneticist. However, it would be prudent for the child to seek consultation with a geneticist and a neurologist if any symptoms appear.\n\n【32】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【33】Since there are no treatment options for infants with type 0 SMA at present, it is vital to be able to detect this disease prenatally in order to provide the best possible care for the patient and parents including the provision of palliative care for the patient, if needed. An increased NT is a clinically relevant sign that can be related to multiple foetal malformations, genetic syndromes, intrauterine death risk, congenital heart defects, and high risk of miscarriage. However, at present, there are only limited data supporting an association between NT enlargement and SMA.\n\n【34】Employment of extensive panel genetic testing using next-generation sequencing would be beneficial for the prenatal diagnosis of type 0 SMA cases. Moreover, sequencing of foetal exomes covering single nucleotide variations and copy number variations (also SMN1) offers a broader diagnostic capacity for pregnancies with unexpected foetal anomalies, thus improving both diagnostic timing and counseling for parents. Early recognition of the disease would give parents time to come to terms with the situation as well as provide the option of pregnancy termination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The clinical prevalence of MTS-related DVT is likely underestimated, particularly in patients with other more recognisable risk factors. MTS is classically described in females between the age group of 20–50 years. In patients with acute iliofemoral thrombosis, medical treatment with anticoagulation alone has been associated with higher risk of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) and lower iliofemoral patency rates, as compared to endovascular correction. We describe a case of MTS-related extensive iliofemoral DVT occurring in a middle age male who presented with acute onset of left lower limb swelling and pain, complicated by pulmonary embolism. Doppler compression ultrasonography of the left lower limb showed partial DVT extending from the left external iliac to the popliteal veins, and contrasted computed tomography (CT) of the thorax abdomen and pelvis established features of MTS, together with right pulmonary embolism. He was started on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and then underwent left lower limb AngioJet pharmacomechanical thrombolysis/thrombectomy, iliac vein stenting, and temporary inferior vena cava (IVC) filter insertion. After the procedure, the patient recovered and improved symptomatically with rapid resolution of this left lower limb swelling and pain. He was switched to an oral Factor Xa inhibitor and was subsequently discharged.

MTS is an anatomical variant in which the right common iliac artery overlies and compresses the left common iliac vein against the lumbar spine and is an important anatomical risk factor for venous thrombosis.\n\n【4】Although this variant has been shown to be present in more than 20% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>, the reported clinical prevalence of MTS-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been low at only 2-3% of all lower limb DVTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>, suggesting an underestimation of its actual prevalence. The most common clinical presentation of MTS is unilateral leg swelling due to an acute DVT and is more common in women with the majority between 20 and 50 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Treatment options for MTS-related DVT includes endovascular thrombolysis/thrombectomy and stent placement, in addition to standard anticoagulation.\n\n【5】We report a case of MTS-related extensive iliofemoral DVT occurring in a middle age male who presented with seemingly unprovoked left iliofemoral vein thrombosis, complicated by pulmonary embolism.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 63-year-old Chinese gentleman was admitted with a 4-day history of progressive left lower limb swelling and pain. There was no history of trauma to the leg. He did not have any fever, chest pain, breathlessness, nor constitutional symptoms.\n\n【8】This was his first episode presented as such. He had a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, when he was on diet control with no chronic medications. There was no family history of DVT. He had no recent prolonged flights or immobilization, although he was working as a private car hire driver with ten-hour shifts. He was a never smoker.\n\n【9】He was comfortable and afebrile with normal vitals and oxygen saturation. The cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. His left lower limb was warm and mildly tender, associated with swelling up to the midthigh measuring 4 cm more than the right . There was no evidence of stasis dermatitis, varicosities, or phlegmasia cerulean or alba dolens. His peripheral distal pulses were well felt.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Unilateral oedematous swelling of left lower limb.</u>\n\n【11】Initial blood investigations including full blood count, renal panel, and coagulation profile were normal; fasting glucose for diabetes screening was negative. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no heart strain. Doppler compression ultrasonography of the left lower limb showed partial DVT extending from the external iliac (EIV), common femoral (CFV), to the popliteal veins 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a)–2(c))</u>.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Ultrasound of left lower limb demonstrating (a) thrombosis involving the EIV, (b) failure of compressibility of CFV, and (c) no colour flow on duplex scan confirming the diagnosis of DVT. (d) CT of the patient showing the right CIA (white arrow) compressing the left CIV against the lumbar vertebrae (black arrow).</u>\n\n【13】In view of the extensive nature of the thrombosis, a contrasted CT of the thorax abdomen and pelvis was performed both to rule out an intrabdominal pathology as well as look for pulmonary complications in the same sitting. His CT eventually showed compression of the left common iliac vein (CIV) against the lumbar vertebrae by the overlying right common iliac artery (CIA), just caudal to its confluence with the right CIV 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u>, with no definite filling defect identified in the IVC. In addition, filling defects in the right upper lobe and lower lobe pulmonary arterial lobar/segmental branches were noted, consistent with pulmonary embolism without evidence of right heart strain. In the absence of any suspicious pelvic mass, these features were suggestive of MTS. He was started on LMWH enoxaparin.\n\n【14】During the operation, a temporary IVC filter was first inserted via a retrograde right femoral common femoral vein approach (Bard Denali) to mitigate the risk of massive pulmonary embolism and cardiovascular collapse during wire and device manipulation through the iliac thrombus. The left posterior tibial vein at the ankle was the initial vascular access site to allow full evaluation and thrombus removal of the entire femoropopliteal segment in addition to the iliac veins. Intraoperative venogram demonstrated extensive intravenous thrombus from the left CIV to proximal superficial femoral vein (SFV) 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. This was treated with AngioJet pharmacomechanical thrombolysis/thrombectomy (Boston Scientific, Massachusetts, United States of America) using the ZelanteDVT thrombectomy catheter and a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase 20 mg in 100 ml normal saline). Vascular access was then obtained via the left mid-distal femoral vein for diagnostic intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) which confirmed compression at the level of the CIV (cross-sectional area∼126 mm<sup>2</sup>) followed by iliac vein stenting using a 16 × 60 mm ABRE (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) bare metal stent. There was uninterrupted contrast flow through the left CIV upon completion of the procedure 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(b)–3(c))</u> with resolution of the compression and increased CIV cross-sectional area (∼198 mm<sup>2</sup>) on IVUS.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Intraoperative venogram (a) demonstrated extensive intravenous thrombus in the CFV and proximal SFV.

He was initially observed in the high dependency ward, with improvements of his lower limb swelling, and was subsequently transferred to the general ward where he remained well. His enoxaparin was switched to a Factor Xa inhibitor Apixaban (10 mg BD loading dose for 7 days followed by 5 mg BD maintenance dose), which he was discharged with to complete a total of 1 year duration. On his 1-month follow-up, the patient remained well with resolution of his lower limb swelling and pain. An ultrasound duplex iliac scan showed a patent left CIV stent with subacute to chronic venous thrombosis partially occluding the left CFV. He subsequently underwent an uneventful elective IVC filter retrieval, with plans for a 1-year repeat ultrasound and follow-up.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】MTS, also known as iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS), was first described by May and Thurner in 1957 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and is an important anatomical risk factor for venous thrombosis. The pathogenesis of MTS-related DVT is likely to be a combination of vascular endothelial thickening, reduced vein diameter, and mechanical compression. Although this variant has been shown to be present in more than 20% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>, the reported clinical prevalence of MTS-related DVT has been low at only 2-3% of all lower limb DVTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. This may suggest an underestimation of its actual prevalence and is likely due to missed diagnosis, especially in patients with other more recognisable risk factors.\n\n【19】The most common clinical presentation is unilateral leg swelling due to acute DVT and is more common in women with the majority aged between 20 and 50 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It can also present as chronic venous insufficiency and venous stasis with varicosities or ulceration. Other factors that may increase the likelihood that asymptomatic MTS will progress to symptomatic MTS include immobilization, contraceptive use, recent pregnancy, and previous intra-abdominal surgical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The treatment of MTS largely depends upon the presence of symptoms, their severity, and whether thrombosis is present. For symptomatic patients with iliofemoral DVT, as with our patient, treatment options include endovascular thrombolysis/thrombectomy and stent placement, in addition to standard anticoagulation. In observational studies and retrospective reviews of patients with MTS-related DVT, endovascular thrombolysis and/or stenting have consistently shown to be a safe and effective method for achieving high venous patency rates and provide relief of acute symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 9–11\\]</u>. In addition, though not stratified based on a diagnosis of MTS, systemic reviews of studies evaluating the treatment of acute iliofemoral thrombosis have shown that endovascular thrombolysis compared with anticoagulation alone is associated with higher iliofemoral patency rates and reduced risk for postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–16\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The optimal duration of anticoagulation is unclear due to the lack of consensus on postintervention antithrombotic therapy for MTS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. It is recommended that therapeutic anticoagulation should be continued using similar dosing, monitoring, and duration per venous thromboembolism (VTE) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>; direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), including apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are effective alternatives to vitamin K antagonist but their use remain limited in specific populations with pregnancy, cancer, and renal insufficiency conditions. In patients who have had stent placement, anticoagulation for at least six months to prevent in-stent restenosis is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Following successful thrombolysis and stent placement, patients are also encouraged the use of sized-to-fit compression stockings for prevention of PTS as per acute DVT treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>, assuming no contraindications including severe arterial insufficiency, overlying skin ulceration, or allergy to stockings material.\n\n【22】Our patient was diagnosed with MTS-related acute left iliofemoral DVT complicated by pulmonary embolism. His management included deployment of a temporary IVC filter, AngioJet pharmacomechanical thrombolysis/thrombectomy with iliac vein stent placement, and was discharged with apixaban with plans for repeat imaging to monitor stent patency.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】May–Thurner syndrome is an important anatomical risk factor for venous thrombosis and is very often underdiagnosed in patients with DVT. Our case underscores the importance of having an index of suspicion in patients who present with seemingly unprovoked left iliofemoral vein thrombosis, including in males. The consideration and accurate diagnosis of MTS remains critical, as in addition to standard therapeutic anticoagulation, these patients would benefit from anatomical correction of the affected segment to maintain venous patency and prevent long-term complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In this case, we describe a 55-year-old Chinese Singaporean man, who presented with acute onset of nonbilious and nonbloody vomiting with diarrhoea and left leg pain. He was found to have gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Group C complicated by an intramuscular abscess of his left leg. We reviewed the literature in the context of this unusual presentation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 55-year-old Chinese Singaporean man with a background of Polycythemia Rubra Vera (PRV), currently on treatment with hydroxyurea and anagrelide, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, was admitted with a four-day history of nonbilious, nonbloody vomiting accompanied with nonbloody diarrhea. This was associated with fever and also left leg pain and swelling. He had no other infective symptoms including cough, sputum production, or dysuria.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed pyrexia (temperature: 38.9 degrees Celsius), blood pressure of 140/60 mmHg, and pulse rate of 80/min. His left calf was erythematous, swollen, warm, and tender. His abdomen was soft and nontender with no bruits. No pitting oedema was present. Routine blood investigations showed normal inflammatory markers and biochemistry . Ultrasound of the left lower limbs showed thrombosis of the left posterior tibial vein. Blood and stool cultures on admission grew Group C Salmonella.\n\n【7】Table 1 Initial blood test results.\n\n【8】He was started on intravenous ceftriaxone and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LWMH) for deep venous thrombosis.\n\n【9】However, he had persistent fever and became hypotensive on the 10th hospital day. Repeat blood cultures grew Group C Salmonella, but repeat stool culture grew Group B Salmonella. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetation. Computed tomography (CT) aortography did not reveal aortitis.\n\n【10】Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the left lower limb was performed. It showed a multiloculated collection with enhancing rim and septa centered within the tibialis posterior muscle, measuring approximately 13.9 × 4.4 × 4 cm with adjacent myositis and fasciitis .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Axial, T2 weighted, fat saturated, STIR MR image showing loculated fluid signal within the tibialis posterior muscle , suggestive of a collection.

Intraoperatively, a multiloculated intramuscular abscess in posterior tibialis muscle was observed; 15 mls of frank pus was drained. Two drains were inserted, with the inferior drain at the residual space of the posterior tibialis muscle and superior drain into the space between the posterior tibialis and soleus. Intraoperative pus culture grew Group B Salmonella.\n\n【17】His condition improved dramatically following the drainage with resolution of pyrexia and hypotension. IV ceftriaxone was continued for a total duration of six weeks with oral metronidazole. LWMH was administered for six weeks as well. He remained well six months after discharge.\n\n【18】#### 3\\.

Due to the development of obesity, there is a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among these patients. This case report presents a patient with PWS with morbid obesity, severe OSA, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome admitted to the hospital for hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) with average volume-assured pressure support, a newer NIV modality, was used successfully to treat this patient, achieving major clinical and gas exchange improvement both during the hospitalization and long term after discharge.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) has a prevalence of about 1/15,000 people and is the most common syndromic form of obesity. The syndrome is caused by lack of expression of the long arm on chromosome 15, specifically 15q11.2-q13, with 65–75% of the cases associated with paternal deletion of this chromosomal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】PWS is characterized by a multitude of features that occur from early childhood to adolescence, with one of the primary findings being the development of obesity during early childhood in the setting of hyperphagia. Because of this, there is a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Adenotonsillectomy is the primary treatment for OSA in pediatric patients; if unsuccessful, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. If CPAP and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) fail, tracheostomy is a treatment option of last resort. This case report presents a patient with PWS with morbid obesity, severe OSA, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) who was admitted for hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. NIV with average volume-assured pressure support with auto-titrating end expiratory airway pressure (EPAP), (AVAPS-AE), a newer NIV modality, successfully treated the hypoventilation during the hospitalization and after discharge.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 6-year-old boy with past medical history of PWS, hypotonia, mild developmental delay, and early onset thoracic scoliosis treated with posterior spinal growing rod placement presented with a 2-year history of loud snoring. He underwent in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG), which showed severe OSA, with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 133.7 events/hour. The patient was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and placed on CPAP 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with clinical improvement. He was started on home CPAP and underwent an in-laboratory CPAP titration in which the AHI improved to 1.2 events/hour with nasal CPAP 14 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. After that, the patient underwent surgical intervention with a combined uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and adenotonsillectomy. Postoperative PSG showed improved but persistent severe OSA with residual AHI 37 events/hour. The patient did not attend postsurgery CPAP titration study and was noted to have poor CPAP compliance over the next 2 years, after which he was lost to follow up.\n\n【7】At age 11, the patient presented to the hospital emergency room with a 2-day history of fatigue, headache, lethargy, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and swelling in the abdomen and lower extremities. His sister had symptoms consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection. On presentation, he had severe hypoxia, SpO<sub>2</sub> 50% on room air, and was placed on oxygen via non-rebreather mask 15 L/min with improvement in SpO<sub>2</sub> to 98%. Temperature was 36.8°C, blood pressure 167/95 mm·Hg, heart rate 105 beats/minute, respiratory rate 55 breaths/minute, height 1.42 m, weight 107 kg, and body mass index (BMI) 53.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (>99<sup>th</sup> percentile). He had no known history of associated cardiac or endocrine disorders and was on no medications at home. On physical exam, the patient was awake, alert, oriented, and in severe respiratory distress. There were nasal flaring, subcoastal retractions, decreased air movement with diffuse coarse rhonchi and crackles on lung auscultation, tachycardia, generalized abdominal tenderness, and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Attempts to transition to oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min were unsuccessful due to oxygen desaturation to 79%. He was switched to high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 15 L/min and FiO<sub>2</sub> 80%. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary airspace opacities . Admission laboratory results were significant for white blood cell count 20.7 L/mcL, NT-proBNP 1466 pg/mL, troponin 0.08 ng/mL, and venous blood gas (VBG) with pH 7.34, PCO<sub>2</sub> 73 mm·Hg, and PO<sub>2</sub> 40 mm·Hg. A complete respiratory viral panel and SARS-CoV-2 testing with polymerase chain reaction were negative. The patient was admitted to the PICU with acute on chronic hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure in the setting of volume overload, congestive heart failure, and CPAP noncompliance.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest X-ray during Pediatric Intensive Care Unit admission demonstrating enlarged cardiac silhouette, nonspecific bilateral airspace opacities, perihilar interstitial markings, and haziness of the left costophrenic angle.

Suboptimal evaluation related to body habitus.</u>\n\n【9】The patient continued oxygen via HFNC and was treated with high dose intravenous diuretics (furosemide) for volume overload and replacement therapy with potassium chloride. He also received deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Serial troponins peaked to 0.09 ng/mL before decreasing to <0.02 ng/mL. An echocardiogram showed normal biventricular function, with right ventricular pressures estimated to be half of systemic arterial pressures, suggestive of right heart strain and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was treated with daytime HFNC oxygen and nocturnal NIV with bilevel PAP with a Respironics V60 ventilator (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA), with settings of inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and EPAP 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, with FiO<sub>2</sub> 50%. On day 2 of admission the VBG improved, with pH 7.39 and PCO<sub>2</sub> 63 mm·Hg and the volume status also improved with diuresis. The VBG remained stable on day 3 with pH 7.37 and pCO<sub>2</sub> 67 mm·Hg, and the patient was transitioned to CPAP 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with FiO<sub>2</sub> 40%. He did not tolerate CPAP that night and later bilevel PAP 16/6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O due to discomfort, increased work of breathing and continued hypercapnia with both, with worsening VBG to pH 7.33 and pCO<sub>2</sub> 86 mm·Hg on day 4. To avoid intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation, the patient was placed on continuous NIV with AVAPS, a mode of noninvasive ventilation previously used successfully in a pediatric patient at our institution. Initial settings were target tidal volume, (VT) 350 mL (8 mL/kg), EPAP 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, IPAP 15–25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, FiO<sub>2</sub> 30%, respiratory rate 15 breaths/minute, inspiratory time 1 second, rise time 1. AVAPS was used and well tolerated by the patient and the next day, there was significant improvement in gas exchange, with weaning of FiO<sub>2</sub> to 21% on the NIV, and VBG showing pH 7.36 and pCO<sub>2</sub> 41 mm·Hg. Over the course of the next 5 days, the patient’s volume and respiratory status continued to improve. He was switched from continuous to nocturnal NIV and daytime oxygen was discontinued. On day 10 of admission, the VBG was pH 7.35 and pCO<sub>2</sub> 56 mm Hg and weight was 101.7 kg (net loss 5.3 kg). The patient was discharged home that day on nocturnal NIV with a Trilogy ventilator (Philips Respironics) on the following settings: AVAPS-AE, target VT 350 ml, EPAP 6–10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, pressure support 5–15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, respiratory rate 15 breaths/minute, inspiratory time 0.8 seconds, rise time 3, and FiO<sub>2</sub> 21%.\n\n【10】The patient has had a total of four outpatient follow-up visits over 8 months since his discharge and is doing clinically well without hospital readmissions. He has tolerated nocturnal NIV and uses it regularly. His ventilator download data over the most recent 30 days showed excellent compliance, with 93% of days used, with average daily use 6.9 hours, average VT 400 ml, average respiratory rate 21 breaths/minute, and average minute ventilation 8.4 L/min. The patient also lost 4.5 kg during that period. Overall treatment course is focused on maintaining compliance to NIV therapy, as well as weight loss goals, managing symptoms of hyperphagia, and overall treatment of PWS.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】This case highlights the potential therapeutic value of NIV with auto-titrating IPAP and EPAP to treat severe OSA with OHS and hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with PWS. In patients with OSA, surgical intervention is typically the first choice for therapy, and CPAP is recommended for those that fail surgery. In patients with PWS, however, adenotonsillectomy may cause velopharyngeal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, and therefore, PAP therapy may be superior.\n\n【13】Obesity affects 14 million children in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, and OSA has an estimated prevalence of 1.2% to 5.7% of children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The current mainstay treatment of OSA is adenotonsillectomy and if needed, CPAP therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The combination of severe OSA with morbid obesity reduces the benefit of upper airway therapy, and the frequency of perioperative airway complications is also 13% higher (15% vs 2.0%) in severely obese children who undergo tonsillectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. With the obesity epidemic, rates of treatment failures with surgical intervention and traditional PAP therapy may increase and consideration of alternatives is important. NIV therapy may be a treatment option in severe cases of OSA when other therapies fail to avoid surgical interventions of last resort such as tracheostomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Patients with PWS are at higher risk for sleep disordered breathing due to various reasons including obesity, craniofacial features, and hypotonia. In fact, the prevalence of OSA in PWS is 80%, which is much greater than in the general pediatric population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is a primary contributor to pediatric OSA, but it may also be present as a side effect of growth hormone treatment in PWS. Though the obstructive aspects of sleep apnea may be explained, the etiology of higher prevalence of central sleep apnea in this population is unknown at this time. Patients with PWS have abnormal ventilator control during sleep, higher arousal threshold for hypercapnia, reduced ventilatory response, and limited arousal response to hypoxia. A combination of these factors would indicate a significant risk for sleep-related hypoxia and hypoventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8\\]</u>. In fact, it is common to the PWS phenotype to present with nocturnal hypoventilation, which is not typical for most other patients with OSA, and this may occur without central or obstructive sleep apnea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. On NIV with AVAPS-AE, respiratory failure with hypoxemia and hypercapnia can resolve, as in the case of our patient. In addition, this case showcases the potential of maintaining long-term stability as an outpatient with this treatment modality with appropriate compliance, thus avoiding further hospital admissions and other surgical interventions like a tracheostomy.\n\n【15】CPAP therapy is a type of conventional OSA treatment that provides a constant flow of gas at a predetermined pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. AVAPS is a mode of NIV with IPAP that targets a goal VT based on ideal body weight to treat hypoventilation. The spontaneous respiratory flow is monitored, and the ventilator adjusts the IPAP within a set range to maintain the target VT. AVAPS-AE adds auto-titrating EPAP to treat comorbid OSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Due to the novelty of the mode and its recent introduction to the pediatric population, there are limited data on AVAPS therapy as a treatment modality for hypoventilation in children, with mostly case reports published despite increasing interest and use over time. We have previously shown AVAPS to be effective in treating very severe OSA and nocturnal hypoventilation in a child both in the sleep laboratory and long term as outpatient avoiding the need for tracheostomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This modality has also been used successfully in a group of 45 adult patients with OSA who failed a prior CPAP titration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The largest case series of AVAPS use in the pediatric population was published in 2021 and included 19 patients with nocturnal hypoventilation due to multiple medical conditions who had failed a bilevel PAP titration in the sleep laboratory due to persistent hypoventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. AVAPS titration was shown to be more effective than conventional bilevel PAP titration in decreasing nocturnal transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> levels. This case series included a 12-year-old patient with PWS, the only patient with morbid obesity in the group. To our knowledge, this is the only previous report of use of this NIV modality in PWS. In our case, we document the effectiveness of AVAPS therapy during an inpatient admission for cardiorespiratory failure and for long-term use while outpatient.\n\n【17】In conclusion, we report on the successful use of NIV with AVAPS in treating severe OSA, OHS, and cardiorespiratory failure in a pediatric patient with morbid obesity and PWS, both in inpatient and outpatient settings when other NIV modalities failed. A trial of this NIV modality may be considered in pediatrics as a treatment option in complicated or refractory cases of severe OSA and OHS with associated severe gas exchange abnormalities prior to the use of invasive ventilation. More studies need to be done to clarify the therapeutic role of this NIV modality in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Currently, the incidence and prevalence of DMI are difficult to conclude, and there is no clear algorithm or standard of care in managing this condition. Pathogenesis of the microangiopathy of DMI remains unclear. A major finding in this investigation of DMI emphasizes that, within 2–17 weeks, patients who initiate low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, bed rest, and close outpatient follow-up see significant size reduction of lower extremity mass and complete resolution of pain without being subjected to invasive muscle biopsy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Diabetic Muscle Infarction (DMI), also referred to as Diabetic Myonecrosis (DM), is a rare complication of poorly controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes affecting the thigh muscles in 80% of cases and lower leg muscles in 17% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. DMI can mimic other conditions such as cellulitis, deep vein thrombosis, or even necrotizing fasciitis leading to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management due to scarce literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is usually seen in those with microvascular complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and most commonly, nephropathy. The incidence and prevalence of DMI are difficult to conclude. In a 2006 systematic review, 115 cases were reported, but the actual incidence of diabetic muscle infarction is speculated to be much higher with a predilection for those who are middle aged and of female sex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A systematic review published in 2015 reported 170 cases of DMI since its first introduction to the literature in 1965. This included 126 initial presentations and 44 episodes of recurrence, with a mean age of presentation being 45 years and a range of 20 to 67 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. There is still no clear algorithm or standard of care in managing this condition. In this case report, we explore both presenting signs and efficient management of DMI in an effort to prevent subjecting patients to invasive and unnecessary procedures such as biopsies and surgical debridement that ultimately may lead to significant morbidity.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 52-year-old Hispanic male with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemic cardiomyopathy presented with a one-month history of nonradiating right thigh erythema, pain, and swelling. He worked as a warehouse clerk; however, due to the severe, debilitating pain to his right thigh, the patient was on disability. He required maximal assistance in ambulation and, at times, even a wheelchair. He denied a history of fever, physical trauma, or intravenous drug use. The patient reported several emergency department and urgent care visits prior to our evaluation with no significant improvement on oral antibiotics for presumed cellulitis. Vital signs on presentation included blood pressure 108/69 mm Hg, heart rate 77 beats per minute, temperature 37.5°C, respiratory rate 18, and 96% on room air. On physical examination, a hard, tender, erythematous 7 × 4 inch right anterior thigh mass with accompanying right upper thigh edema was noted 通用删除1(英):<u>(as shown in Figure 1)</u>. Distal pulses were 2+ on palpation. Right lower extremity had 3+ pitting edema, while the left lower extremity had 2+ pitting edema. Severe tenderness was also noted in the right groin region with associated painful groin lymphadenopathy.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Physical exam showing significant edema of the right thigh.</u>\n\n【7】White blood cell count was 10.7 × 10^3 cells/mcl; other laboratory tests did show signs of systemic inflammation including elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate 49 mm and elevated C-reactive protein 7.98 mg/dL. Aldose value was 3.8 units/L. The patient had an elevated creatinine 1.31 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL, urine albumin/creatinine ratio 1,342.8 mcg/mg Cr, and creatinine kinase 844 unit/L, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 10.3%, and blood cultures were negative. Laboratory values to diagnose polymyositis and dermatomyositis were negative. A venous Doppler ultrasound of the right leg was negative for deep vein thrombosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast of the femur demonstrated bilateral inflammatory changes with disproportionate enlargement and diffuse heterogeneity of the right vastus medialis muscle with patchy areas of intramuscular hemorrhage, extensive subcutaneous edema, interfascial free fluid, and severe myositis 通用删除1(英):<u>(as shown in Figure 2)</u>.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 MRI without contrast of the right femur: bilateral inflammatory changes manifested by extensive subcutaneous edema with interfascial free fluid as well as severe myositis. Disproportionate enlargement of the right vastus medialis muscle which is diffusely heterogeneous with a patchy area of intramuscular hemorrhage is shown.</u>\n\n【9】Due to lack of improvement of symptoms on antibiotics and poorly controlled diabetes, the diagnosis of diabetic muscle infarction was considered. The treatment consisted of analgesia, low-dose aspirin, bed rest, and close outpatient follow-up. Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient was referred to a tertiary center for muscle biopsy; however, this was delayed due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Three months after being discharged from the hospital, the patient endorsed a significant size reduction of right thigh mass, complete resolution of pain, and endorsed being able to ambulate without assistance. With time, rest, and excellent adherence to low-dose aspirin, he no longer required a biopsy due to complete resolution of symptoms.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Diabetic muscle infarction (DMI) is a rare, often-missed diagnosis that causes significant pain and disability for patients. The mean duration of symptoms before presenting for care is about four weeks, and the time to resolution ranges from 2 to 17 weeks with an average of four weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. As discussed by Smith et al. typical clinical presentation of DMI includes abrupt onset of pain in the affected muscle accompanied by local swelling with subsequent partial resolution and appearance of a palpable painful mass. DMI most frequently affects the thigh, and the quadriceps was the most commonly affected muscle; calf involvement has also been reported. It is mostly unilateral; however; bilateral lower extremity involvement has been reported. The muscles more frequently affected were the vastus lateralis and the vastus medialis, as seen in our patient’s case with Figure 2 showing significant inflammatory changes of the right vastus medialis muscle. The characteristic feature of DMI in MRI is an increased signal from the affected muscle area (intramuscular and perimuscular tissues) in T2-weighted, inversion-recovery, and gadolinium-enhanced images and isointense or hypointense areas on T1-weighted images, secondary to increased water content from edema and inflammatory changes that accompany the infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. DMI may be diagnosed by means of a combination of clinical presentation and radiological imaging. The most valuable diagnostic technique is MRI; axial images are the best plane for diagnosis, although coronal and sagittal images may be useful to document the extent of involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Muscle biopsy is not recommended, but typically shows muscle fiber necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and hyalinization of the blood vessels with luminal narrowing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The pathogenesis of DMI remains to be clarified. The most likely hypothesis is that muscle infarction is caused by vascular disease such as arteriosclerosis and diabetic microangiopathy. Epidemiologic data suggest that the presentation of acute or insidious lower limb pain may be linked to arteriosclerotic factors such as endothelial and platelet dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Some literature suggests an alteration in the coagulation-fibrinolysis system as the cause of DMI which is supported in a case series by Palmer and Greco who reported two patients with DMI and antiphospholipid syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Although it is difficult to assess the relative contribution of microvascular complications of diabetes versus antiphospholipid antibodies to the DMI, the experiences of Palmer and Greco were further supported by Gargiulo et al. that indicate the antiphospholipid antibodies as contributing factors in the progression of diabetes complications, acting as a link between the immunological and hemostatic systems in the pathogenesis of diabetic microangiopathy. Our patient tested negative for antiphospholipid antibodies.\n\n【13】Treatment with low-dose aspirin decreases mean recovery time by 2.5 weeks through its antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Aspirin irreversibly blocks prostaglandin H synthase (cyclooxygenase-1) in both platelets and megakaryocytes, preventing the formation of thromboxane A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This further supports its use in slowing the microischemic complications seen in poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The delay in muscle biopsy due to the COVID-19 pandemic was a blessing in disguise for our patient as it gave him the time to heal with over-the-counter low-dose aspirin. An astute physician will carry a high index of suspicion for this underdiagnosed condition when evaluating thigh pain and swelling in patients with poorly controlled blood glucose levels. Patients who see significant improvement after the initiation of appropriate glycemic control, rest, and low-dose cetylsalicylic acid within 2–17 weeks should not be subjected to invasive muscle biopsies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is the congenital presence of pancreatic tissue outside its normal location in the absence of vascular and anatomical connection with the main pancreas. HP can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, and it is mostly encountered in the stomach. The gallbladder is a rare site of HP, and our literature review revealed that only 38 cases were reported. We present a case of HP in the gallbladder that was presented with a picture of acute cholecystitis. After the case presentation, we will discuss HP in the gallbladder by reviewing the literature. Case Presentation. A 49-year-old male presented to the emergency department complaining of progressively worsening right upper abdominal pain for the last 24 hours. After thorough history and physical examination, a provisional diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a rim of edema surrounding the gallbladder wall with two stones impacted at the gallbladder neck. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed with an uneventful postoperative course, and the patient was discharged the next day. Microscopic examination of the gallbladder showed that a heterotopic pancreatic tissue, composed of a large number of pancreatic acini and few ducts with the absence of islets of Langerhans, was found around the cystic duct. The patient was asymptomatic at the regular follow-up six months postoperatively. Conclusion. HP in the gallbladder is an extremely rare finding. Its clinical presentation is not different from other cholecystopathic diseases. Most cases were accompanied by cholelithiasis. Preoperative laboratory and imaging modalities are usually not helpful in the diagnosis of HP in the gallbladder. The definitive diagnosis is made by histological examination of the gallbladder specimen. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is sufficing treatment.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is the congenital presence of pancreatic tissue outside its normal location in the absence of vascular and anatomical connection with the main pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There is no consensus about the exact origin of HP until the present. Three theories have been proposed to explain it. One adopted that HP is formed as a result of pancreatic tissue separation during the embryonic rotation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Another theory suggests that the longitudinal growth of the intestines is responsible for the migration of some cells from pancreatic buds which causes HP in different regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Irregularity in the notch signaling system is a recent accepted theory, which believes that irregularity in the signaling system that decides the destiny of pancreatic cells, specifically abnormalities in Hes-1 (Hairy/enhancer of split), might be a contributor in the formation of HP in the gallbladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. HP can be seen anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract, and it is mostly encountered in the stomach, duodenum, and colon with percentages of 27.5%, 25.5%, and 15.9%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Also, it can be seen in the esophagus, Meckel\\`s diverticulum, gallbladder, biliary tract, spleen, liver, omentum, and lung. Usually, heterotopic pancreatic tissue is asymptomatic, but it can present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. In autopsy studies, HP was found in about 0.5%–13.7% patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The estimated incidence of HP in abdominal surgeries is 0.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. HP in the gallbladder is an extremely rare finding. To the best of our knowledge, there are only 38 cases in the literature. In this case report, we present a case of HP in the gallbladder and the current literature reviewed.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Methodology and Data Collection\n\n【5】A thorough search among the published literature using the PubMed search engine was done. Specific search terms (keywords) were heterotopic pancreas or ectopic pancreas and gallbladder. The following filters were used: English language and human and case reports. A bibliography of relevant articles was reviewed in an attempt to find other relevant articles. The following data were collected: demographic information including age and gender, clinical presentation, sonographic findings including presence of gallstones, surgical intervention, site and size of the heterotopic pancreas (HP), and histological type of HP.\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case Report\n\n【7】A 49-year-old male presented to the emergency department complaining of progressively worsening right upper abdominal pain, which was continuous, dull aching in nature, and associated with vomiting for the last 24 hours. The patient had a previous history of mild abdominal pain, especially with fatty meals, for the past six months. On examination, he had a heart rate of 85 beats/minute, a blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg, a temperature of 37.4°C, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/minute. The abdominal examination revealed localized right upper quadrant tenderness with a positive Murphy’s sign. Laboratory investigations showed an elevated WBC count of 16.7 ∗ 103/μL (reference range: 4.5–10 ∗ 10<sup>3</sup>/μL) with 77% neutrophils, hemoglobin was 14.6 g/dL (reference range: 14–18 g/dL), and platelet count was 193 ∗ 10<sup>3</sup>/μL (reference range: 150–450 ∗ 10<sup>3</sup>/μL). Other laboratory results include aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 35 U/L (reference range: up to 37 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 33 U/L (reference range: up to 42 U/L), alkaline phosphatase was 103 U/L (reference range: 98–279 U/L), total bilirubin was 0.82 mg/dL (reference range: up to 1 mg/dL), direct bilirubin was 0.29 mg/dL (reference range: up to 0.20 mg/dL), and serum amylase was 97 U/L (reference range: 40–140 U/L). Urea, creatinine, and serum electrolytes (sodium and potassium) were within normal limits. Sonographic examination showed a thin gallbladder wall with two stones (12 and 4 mm) impacted in the neck, a rim of edema surrounding the gallbladder wall, and a normal common bile duct.\n\n【8】Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The operative findings were an edematous gallbladder wall with an adherent omentum to it, difficult dissection around the cystic duct, and only one single (15 mm) stone identified in the gallbladder specimen. The postoperative course went uneventfully, and the patient was discharged home the next day.\n\n【9】Microscopic examination of the gallbladder demonstrated an acute on the top of chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis. Moreover, a heterotopic pancreatic tissue, composed of a large number of pancreatic acini and few ducts with the absence of islets of Langerhans, was found around the cystic duct . Follow-up investigations after two weeks, including complete blood count, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, serum amylase, and lipase, were all normal. The patient was asymptomatic at regular follow-up six months postoperatively.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 H & E stain 40x: presence of pancreatic tissue (few ducts and large number of acini with absence of islets), i.e. type II, around the cystic duct.</u>\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Literature Review\n\n【12】A thorough search in the literature shows only 38 cases that have been reported with HP in the gallbladder. We made a summary table of reported cases found in the literature . Female predominance was noted, with an M : F ratio of about 1 : 2. However, our patient was male. The ages of reported cases ranged from eight to eighty with a mean of 43.6 and a median of 46, and most cases were above the age of 40. In most cases, biliary cholecystopathic symptoms were the primary indication for surgical interventions. Cholelithiasis was present in about 50% of cases. Moreover, HP in the gallbladder may resemble gallbladder polyps or malignancy by imaging studies, and this was the indication for surgery in about 10% of reported cases.\n\n【13】Table 1 Demographic data, clinical presentation, and histopathology of 38 cases of heterotopic pancreas in the gallbladder.\n\n【14】Out of the 38 cases, 29 were classified using Heinrich’s classification, which revealed that the most common type is type I. The cases were distributed as follows: 69% were type I, 24% were type II, while type III was present in 7% of cases. Our case was type II. This is the 39<sup>th</sup> case in the literature.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】In the eighteenth century, Jean Schultz et al.’s study was the first one which described heterotopic pancreas. Classification of the ectopic pancreas was made by Heinrich et al. into three types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>:(i)Type I: mimicking the normal pancreatic tissues with the presence of ducts, acini, and endocrine islets(ii)Type II: the presence of a few ducts, a large number of acini, and the absence of endocrine islets(iii)Type III: the presence of a large number of ducts, a few numbers of acini, and the absence of endocrine islets\n\n【17】This classification was modified later by Fuentes in 1973 to include four types of HP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>:(i)Type I: Resembles the normal pancreatic tissue with the presence of ducts, acini, and endocrine islets(ii)Type II: Canalicular variant with pancreatic ducts(iii)Type III or exocrine pancreas only(iv)Type IV or endocrine pancreas only\n\n【18】Macroscopically, HP tissue could appear as an exophytic polypoid growth or as yellow-coloured nodules, and it could measure from few millimetres to four centimetres 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. HP in the gallbladder is extremely uncommon. A case series of 212 cases of HP performed by Mayo Clinic revealed only one case of HP in the gallbladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. While the male to female ratio in HP in the gastrointestinal system is 3 : 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>, our literature review showed that HP in the gallbladder has a female predominance properly due to the higher number of cholecystectomies among female patients.\n\n【19】Although HP in the gallbladder is mostly asymptomatic and found incidentally postoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, the literature review showed that HP is associated with cholecystopathetic symptoms in most of the reported cases. The presentations range from biliary colic to hydrops gallbladder and even perforation of the gallbladder with peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The ectopic tissue is prone to the same pathological conditions as the normal pancreatic tissue such as abscess, pseudocyst formation, or chronic pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Despite that it was not reported in the literature about HP in the gallbladder, the malignant changes of the gastric heterotopic pancreas have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Asahi Sato et al. found a direct association between the developments of cholecystopathetic symptoms and the level of pancreatic enzymes in the bile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【20】In most cases, the preoperative imaging modalities such as ultrasound or computed tomography were not helpful in the diagnosis of HP in the gallbladder as HP can resemble cholesterol polyps, adenomyoma, carcinoma, cholecystitis, cysts, abscess formation, and other lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The value of considering HP in the differential diagnosis of the gallbladder disease is arguable since cholecystectomy is usually performed as a treatment of cholecystopathetic symptoms or to rule out malignancy.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】HP in the gallbladder is an extremely rare finding. Its clinical presentation is not different from other cholecystopathic diseases. Most cases are accompanied by cholelithiasis. Preoperative laboratory and imaging modalities are usually not helpful in the diagnosis of HP in the gallbladder.

He developed numbness and paralysis in his right hand and was diagnosed with right forearm compartment syndrome requiring emergent fasciotomy. After a prolonged hospital stay complicated by respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, he was discharged with improved, but not resolved, sensorimotor deficits. Arterial blood gas sampling is commonly performed in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, for assessment of oxygenation and acid-base status. It is considered a benign procedure, but it can lead to serious complications, such as bleeding and compartment syndrome. Risks and benefits of any procedure need to be weighed carefully and less is often more. Compartment syndrome is characterized by the 5 P’s—pain, pallor, paresthesia, pulselessness, and paralysis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Iatrogenic complications cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. A recent meta-analysis found that approximately 22,165 deaths in hospitalized patients in the United States are preventable each year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In contrast, an Institute of Medicine report from 2000, “To Err is Human,” attributed roughly 98,000 in-hospital deaths per year to human error 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially increased the number of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure whose oxygenation and acid-base status are monitored by arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. Though obtaining an ABG is a common procedure in the emergency department and the ICU and generally considered harmless, complications can occur, and physicians need to weigh the risks and benefits of obtaining an ABG, including whether the result will change patient management, rather than routinely performing this test in hypoxemic ICU patients. Potential complications after arterial puncture include bleeding, hematoma, arterial thrombosis, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula development. Compartment syndrome is a devastating complication that has been described in only a few cases after arterial puncture for blood gas analysis or radial artery catheterization. It can lead to permanent nerve and muscle damage with limb paralysis and loss of hand and arm function. Early recognition and treatment can reduce the associated morbidity significantly.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 71-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease requiring PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) years ago, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, and benign prostatic hyperplasia was transferred to our facility from a long-term acute care facility (LTAC) with a 2-day history of right wrist and hand pain and swelling. 18 days earlier, the patient had been diagnosed COVID-19 viral pneumonia and was admitted to another hospital with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring oxygen administration via high-flow nasal cannula and noninvasive bilevel positive pressure ventilation (BIPAP). After a 16-day ICU stay and treatment with dexamethasone and empiric antibiotics, he was transferred to a LTAC because of persistent high oxygen requirements and the need for prolonged noninvasive ventilation with high-flow nasal cannula and BIPAP. He had undergone frequent ABG sampling from both radial arteries, as well as multiple venous blood draws and peripheral intravenous line placements on both the hands and arms, though he never had an arterial line placed.\n\n【7】On admission to the general hospital ward from the LTAC, the patient reported a 2-day history of progressive right wrist and hand pain and tenderness and right hand swelling. He complained of fatigue, shortness of breath, generalized weakness, and easy bruising and bleeding. He had no prior surgical history, no known drug allergies, and denied tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. His home medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, carvedilol, lisinopril, and as needed sublingual nitroglycerin. Transfer medications included meropenem, famotidine, furosemide, and enoxaparin 90 mg (1 mg/kg bodyweight) every 12 hours subcutaneously. It was not clear from the transfer records whether the indication for therapeutic anticoagulation with enoxaparin was the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 or a suspected right arm arterial or venous thrombosis.\n\n【8】##### 2.1. Physical Exam\n\n【9】His admission blood pressure was 158/70, heart rate 104, temperature 96.7°F (35.9°C), respiratory rate 30/minute, oxygen saturation 88% on 10 liters nasal cannula, weight 88 kilograms, and height 178 cm. He was alert, fully oriented, and tachypneic using accessory respiratory muscles with increased work of breathing. His exam was significant for diffuse bilateral inspiratory crackles without wheezing on lung auscultation and diffuse anasarca in all four extremities. His right wrist and hand were mildly tender and swollen with some bruising noted on the inside of the right wrist. The right radial and ulnar pulses were palpable. He had normal sensation and motor strength in the hand and wrist. The fingers of the right hand were cool to touch.\n\n【10】##### 2.2. Laboratory and Imaging Findings\n\n【11】Relevant admission labs are given in Table 1. Electrolytes and renal function were normal. The admission chest X-ray is shown in Figure 1.\n\n【12】Table 1 Labs on admission.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest X-ray anteroposterior on admission: moderately extensive bilateral patchy airspace disease.</u>\n\n【14】##### 2.3. Hospital Course and Treatment\n\n【15】A heparin infusion instead of therapeutic enoxaparin was instituted for suspected right upper extremity arterial thrombosis, antibiotics for suspected secondary pneumonia were broadened, and intravenous steroids for persistent severe ARDS from COVID-19 pneumonitis were restarted. He was transferred to the intensive care unit due to his profound hypoxemia and required 100% oxygen administered by both high-flow nasal cannula and nonrebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturations above 92%.\n\n【16】The initial differential diagnosis for the patient’s right forearm and hand pain and swelling without sensorimotor symptoms included venous or arterial thrombosis; both the sending and admitting physicians had suspected arterial ischemia as the cause of his hand pain and initiated treatment with full anticoagulation, which would have been appropriate treatment for both venous and arterial thrombosis. The physical exam was not consistent with radial or ulnar arterial thrombosis, with palpable radial and ulnar pulses, though digital small artery ischemia, as can be seen with vasopressor treatment, septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, remained a possibility. Arterial duplex studies demonstrated patent arterial vasculature of the right arm and digits. The vascular surgery team evaluated the patient, did not think the patient had right hand ischemia, and recommended a compression dressing to the swollen wrist. Venous thrombosis remained a concern, and venous doppler studies were pending.\n\n【17】20 hours after admission, the patient reported new onset numbness and tingling in his right thumb, index, and middle fingers. On exam, he had significant tenderness to palpation in the distal volar and dorsal forearm just proximal to the wrist, and the right forearm and hand were significantly more swollen than only hours earlier, with development of a significant hematoma in the right forearm; the radial pulse was no longer palpable. He had newly diminished sensation over the palmar aspect of the D1–3 fingers in a median nerve distribution, and he was unable to move his right first three digits. These findings raised concern for an acute compressive median nerve neuropathy and radial artery occlusion due to compartment syndrome of the right forearm caused by a rapidly expanding hematoma. The ICU team discontinued the heparin drip, applied external pressure to the right radial artery to prevent further bleeding, and consulted plastic surgery for fasciotomy. Compartment pressures were not measured, since the diagnosis was established clinically. The PTT was 40 seconds off heparin (normal <36 seconds); therefore, heparin reversal with protamine was not required.\n\n【18】The patient underwent emergent fasciotomy of the right forearm and hand and right carpal tunnel release. Intraoperatively, the volar superficial compartment had dense hematoma inside the fascial sleeves, especially in the proximal forearm, and the subcutaneous tissue had broad areas of old blood. The hemorrhage in the tissues crossed the carpal tunnel. The median nerve was encased in blood along with the volar forearm due to hematoma. Most of the muscle appeared more hemorrhagic than ischemic. The hemorrhage extended through the superficial and deep flexor musculature in the forearm. The muscles on the dorsal forearm and the extensor muscle compartment were healthy without hematoma. After fasciotomy of the dorsum of the hand, the dorsal interosseous muscles were noted to be engorged with hemorrhagic muscle. The palm and thenar area were soft. The fasciotomy extended to the entire volar forearm and half of the dorsal forearm and across the volar wrist and on the dorsum of the hand.\n\n【19】The patient required two more surgeries, with exploration and debridement four days later and wound exploration and closure 11 days later. His hospital course was complicated by acute blood loss anemia due to ongoing venous bleeding from the surgical site, with a hemoglobin drop to 6.8 g/dL from 12 g/dL in the first 24 hours after surgery requiring blood transfusion. The patient had persistent respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for 5 days postoperatively and septic shock requiring vasopressors and empiric antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. A pulmonary embolism was ruled out by CT. The venous doppler studies revealed a superficial right cephalic vein thrombosis. After aggressive intravenous diuresis for volume overload, he was extubated to BIPAP and weaned to 4 liters nasal cannula on discharge. The patient’s right hand and finger weakness improved, but did not completely resolve, and he continued to require intensive occupational therapy. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility after a combined 41-day hospital stay in 3 hospitals since his initial COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】This patient developed right forearm compartment syndrome with sensorimotor function loss due to an expanding hematoma in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin and a heparin infusion, after repeat radial artery punctures for ABG sampling had led to radial artery injury. Records from the outside hospital did not indicate how long the patient had received therapeutic enoxaparin before transfer and whether this treatment was done for suspected thrombosis or COVID-19 hypercoagulable state which many clinicians at the time treated with either therapeutic or intermediate dose anticoagulation. A small right wrist hematoma was present on admission, and the patient’s hand pain was either caused by hematoma or possibly an early sign of compartment syndrome. The hematoma then expanded in the setting of ongoing empiric anticoagulation for suspected thrombosis, even though no further arterial punctures were performed. Once loss of sensation and motor function in a median nerve distribution occurred, the presence of compartment syndrome was quickly recognized, and a timely surgical intervention saved the patient’s limb, with significant improvement of right hand motor and sensory function at the time of discharge.\n\n【22】The diagnosis of compartment syndrome can be difficult to establish in its early stages, but the cardinal symptoms can be easily remembered as the 5 P’s: pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, and paralysis. Compartment syndrome is treated surgically by fasciotomies of all compartments, which releases the increased pressure that causes tissue and nerve damage. The forearm consists of the following three compartments: dorsal, volar (further divided into a deep and superficial volar compartment), and “mobile wad” . The muscles of the dorsal compartment are innervated by the posterior interosseous nerve; the posterior interosseous artery and interosseous perforators originating from the anterior interosseous artery provide the blood supply to the dorsal compartment. The volar compartment comprised of the muscles that flex, pronate, and supinate both the wrist, hand, and fingers. The median and ulnar nerves innervate the muscles in the volar compartment, and the radial, ulnar, and anterior interosseous arteries provide its blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Compartments of the forearm (color). Schematic drawing by Orlando Garner, MD.</u>\n\n【24】Table 2 provides cases of compartment syndrome secondary to arterial puncture for ABG sampling or arterial line insertion that have been reported in the literature. Shared characteristics include the presence of anticoagulation or a bleeding diathesis, multiple arterial puncture attempts, and the need for fasciotomy for treatment. Outcomes were mixed.\n\n【25】Table 2 Summary of case reports of forearm compartment syndrome after arterial puncture.\n\n【26】Forearm compartment syndrome has also been rarely described in the interventional cardiology literature. Cardiologists frequently use the radial artery as the access site for cardiac catheterization, since transradial catheterization has been associated with fewer major access site-related complications compared to a transfemoral approach. Other complications after transradial cardiac angiography include asymptomatic radial artery occlusion with preserved ulnar perfusion in 2–18%, radial artery spasm in 5–10%, and radial artery perforation in 0.1–1% of procedures. Pseudoaneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas, and hand ischemia are extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In one case series of 520 patients undergoing transradial percutaneous coronary intervention, about 10% developed forearm hematomas; independent predictors of hematoma formation were age, body mass index, multiple puncture attempts, intensive antiplatelet therapy, and multiple catheter exchanges 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In another large case series from one hospital, the incidence of compartment syndrome was 0.004% or 2 out of 51,296 transradial cardiac catheterizations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【27】In summary, compartment syndrome is a rare complication of radial arterial puncture for ABG sampling, arterial line placement, or transradial cardiac catheterization. Forearm compartment syndrome can develop due to procedure-related laceration of the artery, especially if multiple attempts at arterial cannulation are performed. Risk factors for hematoma formation include insufficient external compression after arterial puncture, anticoagulation, or a bleeding diathesis, such as those associated with end-stage renal disease and end-stage liver disease. The forearm compartments are small and cannot hold a large amount of blood; therefore, nerve compression and damage can occur quickly and lead to permanent loss of function of the hand. Other potential complications associated with arterial puncture include pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous (AV) fistula development, which often require intervention with thrombin injection or surgical excision in the case of a pseudoaneurysm or surgical patch repair in the setting of an iatrogenic AV fistula. An expanding hematoma originating from a bleeding femoral or brachial/axillary artery can lead to hemorrhagic shock, since the thigh and upper arm can hold significant amounts of blood products, in contrast to the forearm.\n\n【28】These complications may be avoided by providing adequate compression after an arterial puncture, by placing arterial lines when frequent ABG sampling is anticipated, by performing arterial procedures before the initiation of anticoagulation when possible, by minimizing the number of arterial puncture attempts, and by having experienced providers perform these procedures or using ultrasound guidance.\n\n【29】ABG sampling can provide essential information in critically ill patients with hypoxemia or hypercapnia, but it must be used judiciously; overtesting can lead to patient harm through procedure-related complications, false-positive results leading to more invasive and costly testing and iatrogenic anemia from frequent blood draws 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.

However, an increased risk of breast cancer in NF1 patients has not been widely recognized or accepted. Here, we report two cases of breast cancer in NF1 patients and review the literature on the association between NF1 and breast cancer.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or von Recklinghausen disease is one of the most common autosomal dominant diseases in humans, and its incidence and prevalence have been reported to be approximately 1 in 2,700 and 1 in 4,600, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. NF1 is a group of heterogeneous multisystem neurocutaneous disorders and is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which is considered a classical tumor suppressor. Besides the development of neurofibromas, which are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors, NF1 patients have an increased risk of developing other benign and malignant neoplasms. Breast cancer has been shown to be associated with NF1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>; however, an increased risk of breast cancer in NF1 patients has not been widely recognized or accepted.\n\n【4】Here, we report two cases of breast cancer in NF1 patients and review the literature on the association between NF1 and breast cancer.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case One\n\n【7】A 25-year-old woman with a palpable lump in her right breast was referred to our department. She had been diagnosed with NF1 at the age of 17 years. Two of her aunts had cancer; one had breast cancer and the other had ovarian cancer. However, there was no family history of neurofibromatosis.\n\n【8】On US, an ill-defined hypoechoic mass with microcalcifications and irregular duct changes, extending to the subareolar area, was noted in her right breast. Additionally, several lesions believed to be metastatic lymph nodes were observed in the ipsilateral axilla 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u>. On mammography (MMG), fine pleomorphic microcalcifications with segmental distribution were noted in the lower outer portion of her right breast 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. On MRI, the lesion showed about 6.5 cm sized, nonmass enhancement lesion with heterogeneous internal enhancement pattern and occupied most of the right breast, except the lower inner portion 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(d))</u>.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Ultrasonography shows an ill-defined hypoechoic mass with microcalcifications and irregular duct changes in the right breast. The mass with irregular duct changes extends to the subareolar area (a). Metastatic lymph node is seen in the ipsilateral axilla (b). Mammography shows fine pleomorphic microcalcifications with segmental distribution in the lower outer portion of the right breast. And mild skin thickening (arrows in c) and metastatic lymph node are also noted (c). Magnetic resonance imaging shows that lesion exhibits nonmass enhancement lesion with heterogeneous internal enhancement pattern and occupies most of the right breast, except the lower inner portion (d).</u>\n\n【10】She underwent US-guided core needle biopsy in the lower outer portion of her right breast and of the pathological lymph nodes in the right axilla. She was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ in the breast and metastatic lymphadenopathy in the right axilla. She underwent modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, and the final diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma with axillary metastasis (T2N3M0; estrogen receptor positive; progesterone receptor positive; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative; Ki-67 10–20%). We analyzed DNA from peripheral blood in order to evaluate the presence of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Specific coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequence alterations were confirmed at the genomic level with PCR amplification, and no mutation was noted in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. She received postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Presently, she is being regularly followed up, and she has not shown any signs of disease recurrence.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Case Two\n\n【12】A 47-year-old woman with NF1 visited our department for a palpable lump in her left breast. On MMG, an irregular hyperdense mass with microlobulated margin was noted in her left breast, and pathologic lymph nodes were noted in her left axilla 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. On US, the large mass appeared to be of irregular shape, angular margin, and hypoechoic echotexture and multiple pathological lymph nodes were noted in the left axilla at levels I and II 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(b) and 2(c))</u>.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Left mediolateral oblique mammography shows an irregular hyperdense mass with indistinct margin (thin arrow) and axillary lymphadenopathy (arrowhead). Additionally, skin undulation is seen, indicating presence of cutaneous neurofibromas (thick arrow). Ultrasonography shows a large, hypoechoic, irregular mass with angular margin in the left breast (b) and multiple metastatic lymph nodes in the left axilla (c). PET-CT shows hepatic metastasis (d).</u>\n\n【14】She underwent US-guided core needle biopsy of the irregular mass in the left breast and was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Additionally, during the staging workup, she was diagnosed with hepatic metastasis on PET-CT 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u>. She received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and later underwent modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. The final diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma with axillary lymph node metastasis (T3N1M1; estrogen receptor negative; progesterone receptor negative; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative; Ki-67 10–20%). During follow-up, the hepatic metastasis worsened and lung, bone, and retroperitoneal lymph node metastases were diagnosed. She eventually died 15 months after being diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Here, we reported two cases of NF1 associated with breast cancer. NF1 is a complex neuroectodermal disorder characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, high penetrance, and wide variability in expression. The disease is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, and the risk of various types of tumors, especially those derived from the embryonic neural crest, including pheochromocytoma, leukemia, glioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, astrocytoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, is higher in individuals with NF1 mutations than in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The NF1 gene is located in the pericentromeric region of the long arm of chromosome 17, which interestingly also includes the BRCA1 gene. An interaction between these two genes has been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>; however, the exact interaction is unclear.\n\n【18】Neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene, functions as a negative regulator of the Ras oncogene pathway, interacting with Ras and converting active Ras-GTP to its inactive form Ras-GDP. Ras is an essential component of the signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and the impairment of the hydrolytic reaction is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Hence, the NF1 gene has a potential role as a tumor suppressor gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 39\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The first report of an association between NF1 and breast cancer was published in 1972 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and subsequently several clinical cases of NF1 patients with breast cancer have been reported in the literature. We reviewed the English literature and have summarized all the reports of breast cancer in NF1 patients in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–38\\]</u>. There were 29 cases of breast cancer in NF1 patients and six studies about the association between breast cancer and NF1. Among 20 patients whose age at diagnosis was reported, eight patients (40%) were diagnosed with breast cancer before 40 years of age and five patients (25%) were diagnosed before 30 years of age. Additionally, among 19 patients whose breast cancer stage was reported, 10 patients (52.6%) had advanced cancer (greater than stage IIB). In the six studies, the incidence of breast cancer was reported to be 1.1–19.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Table 1 Summary of previously reported NF1 patients with breast cancer.\n\n【21】Sharif et al. retrospectively evaluated the risk of developing breast cancer among 304 women aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with NF1 over a period of 30 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These authors found that the overall standardized incidence ratio of breast cancer was 3.5 in women with NF1 and that the risk of developing breast cancer at the age of 50 years was 4.9-fold higher in women with NF1 than in women in the general population. Additionally, the cumulative risk of developing breast cancer at the age of 50 years was 2% in women in the general population and was 8.4% in women with NF1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Similarly, Madanikia et al. retrospectively evaluated the risk of developing breast cancer among 126 women aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with NF1 over a period of 15 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. These authors found that the overall incidence of breast cancer in women with NF1 was 3.2%. Additionally, the risk of breast cancer was nearly threefold higher in women with NF1 who were under 50 years old than in women in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Nakamura et al. noted that breast cancer occurred in 18.5% of young women (<35 years of age) with NF1, which is a relatively high incidence when compared to the incidence of 6.7% in young women (<35 years of age) without NF1 reported in another study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Both of our patients developed breast cancer under 50 years of age, and one of these patients developed breast cancer at 25 years of age. A previous article reported the development of breast cancer in a 21-year-old woman with NF1 and BRCA1 mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. However, our patients did not have BRCA gene mutations.\n\n【22】Murayama et al. reported 37 cases of breast cancer associated with NF1, and most of the cases were diagnosed at an advanced stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In both of our patients, breast cancer was diagnosed at an advanced stage (stage IIIC in one case and stage IV in the other case). Furthermore, Evans et al. reported that women with NF1 have not only an increased risk of breast cancer but also an increased rate of mortality associated with breast cancer diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>.\n\n【23】All the above-mentioned articles have similar findings that NF1 increases the risk of developing breast cancer and that NF1 patients with breast cancer have a poor prognosis.\n\n【24】Breast cancer screening guidelines have been well established for the general population and for high-risk women, to decrease mortality through early diagnosis. However, currently, there are no such guidelines for NF1 patients, and guidelines similar to those for Cowden syndrome, which is a genetic disorder associated with breast cancer, should be developed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】The patients and physicians should be aware of the high possibility of breast cancer in individuals with NF1. For early diagnosis, the current guidelines used to screen women in the general population appear to be insufficient to screen NF1 patients. The findings of the above-mentioned reports and other published data justify the requirement of specific screening programs for NF1 patients, similar to the programs for Cowden syndrome patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between NF1 and breast cancer, especially at the genetic level, and to establish specific screening guidelines for the early diagnosis of breast cancer in NF1 patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Case Report\n\n【5】The patient gave the informed consent prior being included into the study. The patient was a 67-year old man who received 70 Gy radiation therapy for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. He received 20 Gy radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and 50 Gy to the supraclavicular fossa. He had concomitant hypothyroidism. He suffered osteoradionecrosis and osteomyelitis of the mandible and received hemimandibulectomy 6 years after the radiation therapy. He was also a smoker.\n\n【6】Eight years after the radiation therapy, he suffered a pathological fracture of the right clavicle without apparent trauma. The fracture was treated conservatively at an orthopaedic clinic; however, bony union was not obtained. The displacement increased over time, and he was referred to our hospital.

Discussion\n\n【16】Past reports suggest that fractures occur primarily with radiation doses >50 Gy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>. Our patient received 70 Gy radiation, and fracture occurred without apparent trauma; therefore, the fracture was diagnosed as a radiation-associated pathological fracture. Biopsy for pathology and culture are required for further investigation in these cases. The nonunion rate of radiation-associated fractures is reported as high at around 50%, and healing times tend to be long in fractures that eventually heal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The fracture developed atrophic nonunion radiographically. Difficulties in achieving bony union were predicted by the radiographic appearance. On the other hand, hot uptake at both ends of the fracture fragments was observed by a bone scan, and the finding suggested the existence of some biological bone activity. We hypothesized that the MRI finding of bone marrow edema suggested some biological bone activity even though the finding might be considered to show postirradiation change in the bone. However, because biological activity is considered to decrease as a result of radiation, we tried to achieve bony union by osteosynthesis with autologous bone grafting. If the bone activity was totally eliminated by radiation, vascularized bone graft should be necessary.\n\n【17】Due to the difficulty in obtaining bony union in radiation-associated fracture nonunions of the clavicle, past reports have recommended claviculectomy or resection of the pseudoarthrosis site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. These procedures have been reported to be effective for pain relief and patient comfort. Only two clinical reports have described successful open reduction and internal fixation of radiation-associated clavicle fractures. Wera et al. reported on open reduction and internal fixation of radiation-associated clavicle fractures for 3 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Two patients obtained bony union, and the remaining patient did not appear to achieve radiographic union but showed no loss of reduction at 28 months postoperatively. Fuchs et al. described the plate fixation and free vascularized corticoperiosteal bone graft for the treatment of radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle in two patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The fractures healed with good clinical results.\n\n【18】Wera et al. used autologous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest and demineralized bone matrix for the first patient, bone cement and allograft cancellous bone chips for the second patient, and demineralized bone matrix for the third patient as a void filler and enhancer of bone healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Fuchs et al. used a free vascularized corticoperiosteal bone graft from the medial femoral condyle to enhance bone healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We believe some supplementary bone healing enhancement is necessary and used autologous cancellous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest. Other tools enhancing bone healing, for example, bone morphogenetic proteins may also be useful; however, we consider that autologous bone grafting is better as it is osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive. Vascularized bone graft is also a good option; however, it is technically challenging. Our treatment result suggests that autologous cancellous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest is sufficient for bony union. If a nonvascularized bone grafting fails, a vascularized bone grafting may become salvage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Locking plate is a new technology which provides excellent angular stability and also preserves biology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Irradiated bone results in a decrease in the circulation to bone and bone quality. Therefore, we think fixation using locking plate is superior to conventional plate fixation in both the biological and mechanical aspects. Locking plate fixation is thought to be a good choice for surgical treatment of radiation-associated fracture/nonunion of the clavicle.\n\n【20】#### 4\\.

Laboratory examination was notable for a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 1.1 mg/dL (normal range, 0.0–0.3), a fibrinogen level of 504 mg/dL (normal range, 150–400), a creatin kinase (CK) level of 1.114 IU/L (normal range, 55–200), and a ferritin level of 2.892 ng/mL (normal range, 40–350). Serum rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antigen, proteinase 3 (PR3)- and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), and anti-Jo-1 antibody were negative.

Discussion\n\n【12】To our knowledge, the histopathology of evanescent salmon-pink rash has not been cleared. A skin biopsy revealed that rash was due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is characterized by angiocentric segmental inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis, and a neutrophilic infiltrate around the vessel walls with erythrocyte extravasation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis has been observed in Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and microscopic polyangiitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>; however, it has not been reported in AOSD. Negative PR3- and MPO-ANCA denied complication with Wegener’s granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis in our patient.\n\n【13】vWF is produced by blood vessel endothelial cells in response to injury, and high vWF level has been observed in systemic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. VEGF is a cytokine participating in inflammation with potent endothelial effect and is produced by macrophages, neutrophils, and vascular endothelial cells and can alter vascular permeability. VEGF has also been suggested to be associated with vasculitis, and elevated serum VEGF levels have been observed in Behçet's disease, microscopic polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and giant cell arteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–12\\]</u>. Elevated blood vWF and VEGF levels in our AOSD patient suggest a significant association between AOSD and vasculitis. We have to mention that VEGF immunostaining on the cutaneous lesion would be more relevant than serum VEGF measurement, and that we did not study serum vWF and VEGF levels after the therapy; however, investigation of changes in their levels after the corticosteroid therapy would be helpful to show their role in the pathogenesis of vasculitis in this patient.\n\n【14】Liver dysfunction in AOSD has been ever described in some case reports. Andrès et al. retrospectively reviewed data of 17 patients with AOSD and found abnormalities in liver biochemistry in 76% of subjects with AOSD, suggesting the high frequency of liver dysfunction in AOSD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, it is difficult to differentiate liver dysfunction due to AOSD itself from drug-induced liver dysfunction. Recently, Chen et al. determined soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) in patients with active untreated AOSD and identified serum sICAM-1 level as a predictor of liver dysfunction in AOSD, and serum sICAM-1 levels were significantly correlated with disease activity and serum ferritin levels which have been also reported to be suitable for monitoring AOSD disease activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In our subject, in spite of decrease in serum CRP and ferritin levels, serum AST and ALT levels were increased by NSAIDs and were promptly decreased by corticosteroid, suggesting the presence of drug-induced liver dysfunction. In this case, NSAIDs also elevated serum CK levels, and a 20 mg corticosteroid therapy promptly decreased serum CK levels, suggesting NSAIDs-induced myositis. To our knowledge, drug-induced myositis in AOSD has not been previously reported. Schwarz-Eywill et al. have also observed that aspirin improved symptoms and CRP but increased serum AST and ALT levels in AOSD patients, and a corticosteroid treatment decreased serum AST and ALT levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. AOSD may have a potential mechanism for enhancing drug toxicity. If we find deterioration in liver function and myositis during treatment, in spite of decrease in CRP and ferritin, we should be aware of drug-induced hepatitis and myositis in AOSD.\n\n【15】In conclusion, our observation indicates that AOSD may be associated with systemic vasculitis and also suggests that we should be aware of the presence of drug-induced hepatitis and myositis in AOSD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

To better illustrate the potential relationship between different eosinophilic immune dysfunctions and the effects of biological therapies in this scenario, here, we present a case of a 63-year-old male first referred to our department in 2018 with a diagnosis of asthma, polyposis, and rhinosinusitis and presenting a suspicion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs’ allergy. He also had a past medical history of eosinophilic gastroenteritis/duodenitis (eosinophilia counts >50 cells/high-power field HPF). The use of multiple courses of corticosteroid therapy failed to completely control these conditions. In October 2019, after starting benralizumab (an antibody directed against the alpha chain of the IL-5 cytokine receptor) as add-on treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma, important clinical improvements were reported both on the respiratory (no asthma exacerbations) and gastrointestinal systems (eosinophilia count 0 cells/HPF). Patients’ quality of life also increased. Since June 2020, systemic corticosteroid therapy was reduced without worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms or eosinophilic inflammation. This case warns of the importance of early recognition and appropriate individualized treatment of eosinophilic immune dysfunctions and suggests the conduction of further larger studies on the use of benralizumab in gastrointestinal syndromes aiming at better understanding its relying mechanisms of action in the intestinal mucosa.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Eosinophils are innate immune multifunctional leukocytes that participate in diverse inflammatory pathways, modulate innate and adaptive immune responses and act as effector cells producing tissue-destructive cationic proteins, cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators. These cells are associated with host defense against parasitic viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. However, recent studies demonstrated that eosinophils also play a primary pathophysiologic role in the so-called eosinophil-associated disorders (EADs), a wide variety of conditions including rhinitis, eosinophilic asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, dermatitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】These disorders have been historically treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, which are often effective at reducing eosinophil counts and associated eosinophilic inflammation but are also associated with serious long-term adverse events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. After 2005-2006, advances in the development of new treatments led to the approval of biological therapies, whose overall mechanism of action targets selective eosinophilopoietic cytokines or other cells interacting with or activating inflammatory pathways. Benralizumab, an antibody directed against the alpha chain of the IL-5 cytokine receptor (IL-5RA), was approved as add-on treatment for moderate to severe eosinophilic asthma grounded on the results of multicenter randomized clinical trials showing significant asthma control improvement and exacerbations reductions (moderate-high certainty of evidence) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. More recently, studies have suggested a potential additional effect of benralizumab for depleting both blood and gastrointestinal tissue eosinophilia in some patients with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID), which may lead to a novel clinical indication for the use of this therapy. Nonetheless, the clinical response among patients using biologics seems heterogeneous, and the possible causative link between this EAD and immunotherapy is not completely known, which requires further investigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>. These are especially important given the unmet need in this field for targeted therapies that can normalize the immune response to triggers, reduce chronic inflammation, and limit or prevent remodeling and tissue fibrosis. Currently, conventional treatment of EGID includes diet, proton pump inhibitors, and corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【5】In this context, we aimed to briefly review the literature on the multiple aspects of eosinophilic immune dysfunctions, focus on the potential association between asthma and EGID, and share the outcomes of a case of a male patient with gastrointestinal eosinophilic syndrome, for whom benralizumab has been indicated for managing severe asthma.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Literature Review\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Eosinophilic Immune Dysfunctions\n\n【8】Eosinophils, although representing only the second granulocyte subpopulation in the circulating blood (<6% of the bone marrow resident nucleated cells), are receiving a growing interest from the scientific community given their complex pathophysiological role in immune homeostasis both as effector immune cells committed to the host defense and as modulators of innate and adaptive immune responses. The most relevant mechanisms of actions are the axis between eosinophils and T-cells, more specifically T helper type 2 (Th2) cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Th2 cells can stimulate eosinophils either directly through the release of interleukin-5 (IL5), or indirectly by promoting a humoral adaptive response with a particular production of IgE, leading to a cascade of events (e.g. a network of intracellular signaling pathways) in the main tissues in which eosinophils are recruited (i.e. digestive tract, adipose tissue, lung, mammary gland, thymus, and uterus) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Classically, eosinophils are associated with the combat of helminthic infections and induction of tissue damage in the context of allergies. However, a broad range of other local and systemic inflammatory diseases as well as cancer and thrombosis are being related to deranged eosinophil functions and unbalanced Th2-responses often associated with eosinophilia or eosinophil-mediated tissue damage which highlights the role of eosinophils as biomarkers. Eosinophilia refers to an absolute count of eosinophils exceeding 450–500 cells/𝜇l, while blood type eosinophilia is usually employed to define thresholds of 1500 cells/μl. In this context, eosinophilic immune dysfunctions or eosinophil-associated diseases/disorders (EADs) are being currently defined as a range of heterogeneous conditions in which eosinophils are believed to play a critical pathological role in self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle of diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. EADs include common illnesses such as eosinophil-related respiratory diseases (chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, and asthma) and skin diseases (dermatitis, cellulitis, urticaria, and severe drug reactions), and other rare conditions such as hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES, defined as association of blood hypereosinophilia with established eosinophil-related organ damage), hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance (HEUS, defined as clinically silent cases of hypereosinophilia), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID). Eosinophilia can also be observed in other immune-mediated diseases such as pemphigoid, systemic sclerosis, sarcoidosis, and IgG4-related diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【10】EADs are lifelong conditions requiring monitoring and associated with substantial burdens both for the patient and its family/caregivers (including chronic and debilitating symptoms, decreased health-related quality of life, and increased out-of-pocket costs for treatment) and for the healthcare system (need for multiple different healthcare professionals and increased emergency departments visits and hospital stays). In New Zealand, for instance, severe eosinophilic asthma patients present over 1.5 times as many respiratory treatment prescriptions and 3.6 higher asthma-related healthcare costs compared to other patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In the United Kingdom, although the prevalence of severe, uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma is low (1%), the associated health-related costs are four times greater (cost ratio 3.9 (95% IC 3.7–4.1)) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Moreover, healthcare resource utilization may be particularly high in EGID, with contributing factors including diagnostic delays (poor disease recognition), repeated endoscopy, and lack of approved medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 17, 18\\]</u>. The median total annual cost of a single eosinophilic esophagitis case in the United States was estimated at USD $3,300 (outpatient visits, pharmacy, and endoscopy); the total health utilization costs per year vary between $350 and 950 million 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19–22\\]</u>.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Linking EGIDs and Allergic Diseases\n\n【12】EGIDs are an umbrella term referring to primary eosinophilic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract encompassing a spectrum of diseases characterized by prominent eosinophilic inflammation affecting different regions of the gut (i.e. esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and colon or a combination) that occur in the absence of secondary causes (e.g. infections and drug reactions) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. The strong association of EGID with allergic disorders such as asthma, dermatitis, rhinitis, and food or drug allergies has been recently recognized, and although their shared pathophysiological basis remains partly elusive (e.g. both are characterized by immunologically Th2 responses and allergic sensitizations), this feature may impact on accurate diagnostic and treatment of these conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 24\\]</u>. Moreover, very few mechanistic studies specifically examine both disorders when found concomitantly in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Most of the knowledge about the coexistence or relationship between EGIDs and asthma comes essentially from the eosinophilic esophagitis literature, probably because this is the most frequent form of EGIDs and because gastritis, enteritis, and gastroenteritis are usually considered as a whole nosologic entity given their clinical similarities. The prevalence of asthma in patients with esophagitis is estimated between 25% and 60%, while in eosinophilic gastritis or gastroenteritis cases it may reach 40%. Primary eosinophilic colitis is the least frequent disorder among EGID; asthma is reported in around 15% of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>. Recent meta-analyses (21 studies, n = 53,592 adult and pediatric patients) confirm that individuals with EGID have significantly increased probability of having asthma (OR 3.06 (95% IC 2.01–4.66)) when compared to controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27–30\\]</u>.\n\n【14】In this scenario, since asthma and EGID may share similar molecular pathophysiology, the possibility of using target therapies has emerged as a potential research area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【15】##### 2.3. Treatment Options\n\n【16】EADs are typically managed with topical or systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, which are initially effective in controlling eosinophilia and symptoms in many patients. However, chronic use of these therapies often leads to serious short-and long-term adverse effects and resistance, requiring second-line agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. For EGID, conventional treatments additionally include elimination diet, proton pump inhibitors, and esophageal dilation in patients who have developed strictures. Nonetheless, these treatments also demonstrate variable response rates and may not always provide long-term disease control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In the past decade, the knowledge of eosinophil biology has led to the development of several biologics targeting eosinophils. These therapies provide the advantage of targeting specific cells or pathways, theoretically increasing efficacy, and limiting complications related to nonspecific effects of more traditional therapeutic approaches. Early research and development efforts of these biologics focused on blocking the action of IL-5; yet, the number of agents approved and under development for managing EAD- especially asthma, has significantly increased in the last years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>. A review of the mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety of different biologicals to treat asthma (i.e. benralizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab, and reslizumab) grounded the development of clinical recommendations and practical guidelines in the field with moderate to high certainty. All these biologicals are able to reduce severe asthma exacerbations, improve asthma control, health-related quality of life, and FEV1, without reaching minimal important differences. They can also reduce the daily doses of oral corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31, 32\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Benralizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody of the isotype IgG1k immunoglobulin that specifically binds to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor expressed on eosinophils and basophils. This drug is approved since 2017 in the United States (Food and Drug Administration agency) and 2018 in Europe (European Medicines Agency) as a maintenance treatment for patients with severe asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype, grounded mostly on the clinical results from phase III pivotal multicenter randomized trials (SIROCCO, CALIMA, and ZONDA), which are also highlighted in several systematic review with meta-analyses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32–35\\]</u>. The usual dose is 30 mg SC every 4 weeks for 3 doses and then every 8 weeks. Other recent studies have also demonstrated potential benefits with the use of benralizumab for managing further respiratory-related EAD such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u> and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (at higher doses) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Table 1 depicts most of the ongoing clinical trials with benralizumab targeting several EADs other than asthma.\n\n【19】Table 1 Main ongoing clinical trials with benralizumab.\n\n【20】Conversely, so far only the biologic dupilumab has been approved (May 2022) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agency to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older), grounded on the positive results of a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, and placebo-controlled trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. Other approvals of biological treatments for these EGID indications are scarce 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Some recently published case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u> demonstrated potential histological remission of gastrointestinal eosinophilia in patients under benralizumab for asthma. However, the clinical response over time seems heterogeneous and may rely on different factors (e.g. gastrointestinal segment affected), requiring further investigation and discussion on the matter.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Case Presentation\n\n【22】This study followed the standards for scientific research of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from the patient, and anonymity was guaranteed (the study followed the CARE checklist 2013-Supplementary material (Available here)). The overall timeline and major events are depicted in Figure 1.\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Timeline of the case report: patient journey and main outcomes.</u>\n\n【24】A 63-year-old male, with a diagnosis of asthma, polyposis, and rhinosinusitis was referred to our facility (Lisbon, Portugal) in 2018 due to suspicion of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) allergy and difficult to control asthma. The patient also had a past medical history of eosinophilic gastroenteritis confirmed by biopsy performed in 2006 (eosinophilic duodenitis) and later on in 2017 (gastric, duodenal, and colonic eosinophilic infiltrates).\n\n【25】According to the patient medical record, gastrointestinal symptoms began in 2000, when he started having sporadic abdominal pains that were relieved with proton pump inhibitors. At this time, he also had eosinophilia (1526 cell/μL), but due to clinical resolution on further investigation was performed. In 2006, the patient was admitted to the Gastroenterology Department due to refractory abdominal pain and postprandial infarction. He still had blood eosinophilia (672 cell/μL). Celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and infection were excluded; an upper endoscopy revealed the presence of eosinophilic duodenitis. The patient underwent a course of corticosteroid therapy and was discharged with symptom resolution. In 2009, ulcerative proctitis was assumed, and he was medicated with mesalamine with resolution of symptoms.\n\n【26】In the same year, the patient started exercise dyspnea-later confirmed in a metacholine bronchial provocation test. At that time, budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg daily was indicated (regimen maintained until 2018). Between 2015 and 2018, he complained about worsening asthma symptoms, specifically cough, dyspnea, and wheezing (with cold and with little physical effort). Currently eosinophil count: 520/μL.\n\n【27】In 2017, due to uncontrolled abdominal pain, the patient was again admitted to the Gastroenterology Department showing moderate blood eosinophilia (1500 cell/μL). The upper endoscopy and ileocolonoscopy, both revealed (off) esophageal, gastric, duodenal, ileal, and colonic eosinophilic inflammation with eosinophilic infiltrates (namely, >50/cell/high-power field (HPF) in the ileon and colon) besides endoscopic evidence of erosions and hyperemia in the ileocolonosocpy 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a)–2(c))</u>. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis was excluded (negative p-ANCA and C-ANCA; normal ECG, echocardiogram, and normal thoracic CT-scan. Skin biopsy also showed no vasculitis); a diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis was reached.\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Comparison of endoscopic alterations in 2017 (a–c) and endoscopic healing in 2022 (d, e).

(e) Normal colonic mucosa in the transverse colon.</u>\n\n【29】In 2018, the patient was once referred to our department due to suspicious NERD (NSAID exacerbated respiratory disease) as he presented dyspnea while taking nimesulide, acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, and metamizole. As the patient was on systemic corticosteroid therapy, it was not possible to do NSAIDs provocation test; yet, clinical history was consistent, and the diagnosis of NERD was assumed. At this time, the blood eosinophil count was 210 cells/mcL (610 in April 2017), ACT (asthma control test) 19 points, CARAT 22 points, and mini-AQLQ (mini asthma quality of life test) 3.0 points. Inhaler technique and adhesion were reviewed, and the patient was prescribed budesonide/formoterol 320/9 μg twice daily, tiotropium bromide 2,5 μg twice in the morning, and montelukast 10 mg daily. The results from pulmonary tests 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u> were as follows: FEV1 3.35 L, 102%; after bronchodilatation 3.76 L, 115% > 12%; FEV1/FVC 62.37%; FVC 5.35 L; after bronchodilatation 5.24 L, <2%; TLC 8.26 L, 123%; ITGG 4,36 L (normal), raw (slightly increased, theoretical value for this patient ); normal diffusing capacity.\n\n【30】In 2019, it was assumed that the patient had severe eosinophilic asthma as the disease was not controlled despite adequate pharmacological therapy according to the GINA guidelines, therapeutic adherence, and correct inhalation technique. Simultaneously, the patient had worsening gastrointestinal symptoms with the need of using systemic steroids (prednisolone 20 to 40 mg daily). This scenario led to the introduction of benralizumab (October 2019) at conventional dosage (first three doses every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks). Sixteen weeks after the first benralizumab injection, clinical improvements in both asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms without asthma exacerbation were noted. No adverse reactions were reported. Improvement in asthma scores (ACT 23 points; CARAT 23 points; mini-AQLQ 4.7 points) and a reduction in blood eosinophil count (to 0 cells/μL) were evident. Additionally, since June 2020, it was possible to reduce systemic corticosteroids to 5 mg per day without worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms. In November 2021, no self-reports of both asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded (blood eosinophil count 0 cells/μL).\n\n【31】Recently, in March 2022, the patient performed a routine upper endoscopy and ileocolonoscopy that still shows no eosinophilic inflammation 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(d) and 2(e))</u>. He is currently prescribed with benralizumab 30 mg each 8 weeks, montelukast 10 mg, rabeprazole 20 mg, budesonide/formoterol 160/2.5 μg daily, topical nasal budesonide 100 μg daily, and prednisolone 5 mg. No complains of respiratory nor gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded; quality of life has improved (ACT 24 points; CARAT 24 points; mini-AQLQ 6.6). The measuring of exhalated nitric oxide did not show eosinophilic inflammation (19 ppb). Since benralizumab initiation, no hospital admissions were reported. The results from pulmonary tests, under maintenance therapy 通用删除7(英):<u>(2022)</u>, were as follows: FEV1 3.56 L, 114%; after bronchodilatation 3.95 L > 11%; FEV/FVC 64.12%; FVC 5.44 L, 137% -after bronchodilatation 5.72 L > 5%; TLC 7.76 L; 115% .\n\n【32】Table 2 Changes in clinical parameters during the patient follow-up 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019–2022)</u>.\n\n【33】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【34】This case and updated literature review warn of the diverse organ manifestations of Th2 inflammation and the potential associations between asthma and EGID, whose pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet completely elucidated. Our findings additionally suggest that target therapies such as benralizumab may have an important role in treating different eosinophilic conditions.\n\n【35】Recognition and appropriate treatment of EGID complications (i.e. symptoms, disease activity, continuous monitoring, and maintenance treatment) by means of a multidisciplinary approach are currently of utmost importance to improve clinical outcomes and patients’ quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Similarly, international asthma guidelines also recommend regular assessment and target treatment of comorbidity conditions such as allergic rhinitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and sinusitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Eosinophilic esophagitis, for instance, has been often associated with allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. It is plausible that similar mechanisms exist for EGID to affect asthma given the pulmonary-esophageal relationship in airway disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Although ideal biomarkers are still currently needed to better characterize asthma phenotypes, it is also important to recognize blood eosinophil count and its proportion with blood neutrophils and lymphocytes as the most reliable measures to predict airway eosinophilia in severe asthma and, therefore, the response to traditional treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and biologic drugs. In this context, the development, validation, and implementation of further point-of-care devices for the management of these conditions in clinical practice are recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Moreover, translational research has identified potential pathways to target in the treatment of EGID, including Th2 inflammation-targeted systemic pathways, mast cells, and eosinophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Preliminary studies reported that cendakimab (IL-13) affect eosinophil count and patients’ symptoms. The IL-5-targeting agents mepolizumab and reslizumab, commonly prescribed for severe eosinophilic asthma, showed histologic improvements in eosinophilic esophagitis (e.g. reduction in eosinophils), but failed to induce symptomatic improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42, 43\\]</u>. The results of a phase 2 trial using lirentelimab (a monoclonal antibody targeting the eosinophil and mast cell transmembrane protein Siglec8) demonstrated a slightly dysphagia improvement in a subset of patients with eosinophilic gastritis or duodenitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Yet, these studies were only powered to assess changes in eosinophil counts rather than any clinical outcomes. Only recently 通用删除7(英):<u>(2022)</u> dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, was approved by the FDA as first target treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis given the improved histologic remission (rates of around 60% when administered weekly vs. 5% in placebo; ) and alleviated symptoms of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. In this context as novel therapies and clinical indications or drug repurposing begin to emerge 通用删除1(英):<u>(i.e. see Table 1 for ongoing clinical trials on the use of benralizumab)</u>, there is a growing need for the full characterization and standardization of outcomes to better understand treatment responses and to facilitate the optimization and personalization of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Nonetheless, different patients may present different responses to treatment. A recent study reported that benralizumab led to histological remission of eosinophilic esophagitis in a 56-year-old patient with severe asthma. Conversely, complete clinical remission was not observed, which exemplified the complex nature of EGID, its associated psychosomatic burden, and the chronification of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A case series of n = 7 patients with eosinophilic GI disorders (n = 7 of them (71.4%) carrying a diagnosis of asthma) also demonstrated that benralizumab completely depleted blood and GI tissue eosinophilia. However, the clinical response, while encouraging, was heterogeneous. Potential explanations for this variability include a lag between eosinophil depletion and normalization of the mucosa and the involvement of other cells, such as epithelial cells or mast cells, in the pathogenesis of symptoms. Residual symptoms in some patients may reflect persistent epithelial changes in the upper GI tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our case, the use of benralizumab also led to a significant and objective reduction of eosinophilia in peripheral blood samples as well as in the histological examination, with zero eosinophilic granulocytes (0/high power field). More importantly, we noted a reduction in patients’ GI complaints/symptoms and hospital admission after treatment initiation, which may be associated with better clinical outcomes and increased quality of life for the patient and his family/caregivers and a reduced burden for the health system.\n\n【39】It is also important to highlight that no significant adverse events or drug discontinuation were related to benralizumab in this case report. In fact, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that this drug has a low risk of overall adverse events (most commonly reported: headache and pyrexia), serious adverse events, asthma exacerbation, bronchitis, and sinusitis, being relatively safe in both short-and long-term treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. Moreover, recent real-world studies on the management of eosinophilic lung diseases confirmed that add-on biological therapy with benralizumab leads to market improvement of severe eosinophilic asthma (including asthma exacerbation rates, prednisone intake, asthma control test, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, quality of life, and eosinophils count) both in patients with and without comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and at no significant safety issues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45, 46\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Yet, one should be aware that the current approved dose for benralizumab (i.e. as add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-actingβ\\-agonists) is 30 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses and then every 8 weeks thereafter. An adjusted dose targeting EGID treatment should be further investigated as it may influence pharmacokinetics/dynamics and outcome achievement. Although a potential synergism between corticosteroids and benralizumab may exist, a recent study indicates that benralizumab causes rapid and near complete depletion of blood eosinophils in the first 24 hours after treatment with a speed of onset effect very similar to that seen with oral prednisolone (time for blood eosinophil level to decrease 50% from baseline was of 1.7 hours (0.7) for benralizumab vs. 2.5 hours (0.3) for prednisolone; ). Authors suggest that benralizumab may be an alternative noncorticosteroid treatment for acute exacerbations of eosinophilic asthma with the potential benefit of inhibiting eosinophilic airway inflammation for at least 30 days after one injection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>. In our case, it was possible to reduce patients’ systemic corticosteroids to 5 mg per day, without worsening of GI symptoms and within six months after benralizumab initiation.\n\n【41】Our findings contribute to the emerging body of data suggesting the need for further studies with a larger number of patients with past clinical history of GI syndrome on benralizumab therapy aiming at better understanding its relying mechanisms of action in the intestinal mucosa and the potential benefits for immune disorders. Given the complexity and potential heterogeneity of EGID (e.g. discordance between symptoms, histology, and endoscopic features), there is a need for comprehensive treat-to-target goals, individualized therapy, and continuous monitoring of treatment response.\n\n【42】This study has some limitations. Although a systematic literature review would be methodologically more robust to cover the topic of asthma and EGID conditions, we demonstrated through a narrative review that the literature is still scarce. Our discussion is grounded on the results of a case reported in our center; however, other cases may have slightly different outcomes and thus should be interpreted within their clinical contexts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Due to the high fatal potential of the disease complications, the radiologist should distinguish necrotizing fasciitis from the most common soft tissue infections, in order to permit a prompt surgical and medical treatment. We present a case of a wide necrotizing fasciitis who presented at our emergency department and we also provide the basic tools, through a review of the literature, for the general radiologist to distinguish, with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, necrotizing fasciitis from the most common infections that could present during our routine practice.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Necrotizing infectious fasciitis (NIF) is a rare disease; incidence of necrotizing fasciitis has been reported to be between 500 and 1500 cases per year in the United States.

Follow-Up\n\n【27】After the surgery clinical conditions of the patient suddenly improved; antibiotics were administrated for two weeks and no other radiological exams were performed.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【29】##### 3.1. Etiology and Demographics\n\n【30】Necrotizing infectious fasciitis (NIF) is a rare disease; incidence of necrotizing fasciitis has been reported to be between 500 and 1500 cases per year in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【31】NIF is a life-threatening, soft-tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading inflammation and necrosis of the skin, involving the subcutaneous tissues and fascia due to the spread of the bacteria among and inside the skin surface. When necrosis is present, it is called NIF; otherwise in all other cases where inflammation of the deep fascia and subcutaneous tissue is present, but there was not a demonstrable necrosis, it is called non-NIF. To distinguish NIF from non-NIF is a fundamental key point due to the different treatment strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【32】NIF was first described by Joseph Jons, an American army surgeon during the American Civil War, and was popularized in the lay media during the 1980s after an increase in prevalence was said to be caused by “flesh-eating bacteria.” The clinical disease is expressed when infective organisms spread through the tissue along the deep fascia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【33】The disease may occur if the right set of conditions are present; these include an opening in the skin that allows bacteria to enter the body such as surgical wounds, bite of animals, scratches, burns, puncture needles, and skin open trauma.\n\n【34】Risk factors for the disease are diabetes, chronic disease, immunosuppressive drugs, malnutrition, age > 60 years, intravenous drug misuse, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, primary and secondary immunological disorders, and underlying malignancy and obesity.\n\n【35】Microbiologically, NIF has been classified as either type I (polymicrobial), type II (monomicrobial), or type III (gas gangrene) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Polymicrobial infections are more common, with cultures yielding a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. The etiologic isolates consist of Gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. pyogenes, and enterococci; Gram-negative aerobes such as Escherichia Coli and Pseudomonas species; and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides or Clostridium species. Type 1 NIF occurs in immunocompromised individuals. Monomicrobial infections are less common than the polymicrobial variety.\n\n【37】The mortality rate may be high as 30%–70% with death being due to sepsis, respiratory failure, kidney failure, or multiorgan system failure.\n\n【38】Studies have shown that only 15% to 34% of patients with NIF have an accurate admitting diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【39】##### 3.2. Clinical and Imaging Findings\n\n【40】###### 3.2.1. Clinical\n\n【41】Patients with NIF can present with constitutional symptoms of sepsis alone or with evidence of skin inflammation, which makes diagnosis a little more straightforward.\n\n【42】The most common signs of skin inflammation in NIF are skin localized pain, skin edema, and erythema with a patchy discoloration of the skin. The skin usually appeared swollen and mottled and a sense of crackling snow suggestive for the presence of subcutaneous gas could be present.\n\n【43】Progression of NIF is marked with the development of tense edema, a grayish-brown discharge, vesicles bullae, necrosis, and crepitus that are clear signs of the skin necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Hemorrhagic bullae and crepitus are sinister signs, with the likelihood of underlying fascia and muscle being compromised.\n\n【45】The physical examination should include all parts of the body to investigate for skin inflammation.\n\n【46】With the spread of the disease among the tissues constitutional symptoms occur such as fever, tachycardia, altered mental state, and diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n【47】Leukocytosis with neutrophilia, acidosis, altered coagulation profile, impaired renal function, raised creatine kinase levels, and raised inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein levels, are helpful if viewed within the whole of the clinical context. We should also remember that clinical scores like the indicator for NIF (LRINEC score) are available to help diagnosis of NIF and differentiate it from other skin and soft tissue infections. Blood cultures and tissue cultures should be performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【48】###### 3.2.2. Imaging Findings\n\n【49】X-rays films do not play a fundamental role in the diagnosis and management of NIF because they could just reveal the presence of subcutaneous gas; thus they could be helpful in the follow-up of the patients in order to monitor the evolution of subcutaneous gas.\n\n【50】CT imaging is a helpful tool in distinguishing NIF from the most common infections of the soft tissues such as cellulitis, nonnecrotizing fasciitis, soft tissues abscess, infectious myositis, and osteomyelitis where there is an involvement of the bone adjacent to the infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【51】Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermis and of the subcutaneous tissues and usually does not involve the fascia. CT demonstrates skin thickening, septation of the subcutaneous fat, and thickening of the underlying superficial fascia. On MRI these alterations of the dermis and of subcutaneous tissues could be detected as linear streaks or as focal areas of alteration of signal, hyperintense on T2-WI and hypointense in T1-WI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Usually in cellulitis there is a thickening of subcutaneous tissues with fluid collections in the subcutaneous fat layer detected as areas of hyperintensity on T2-WI; the deeper fascia is not involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【52】In complicated cellulitis the deeper structures and the fascia could be involved and necrotizing fasciitis should be suspected.\n\n【53】The imaging findings in necrotizing fasciitis are similar to those in cellulitis but are more severe and the involvement of the fascia and of the deeper muscular structures is always present, while in cellulitis it is not a common finding.\n\n【54】One specific distinguishing sign of necrotizing fasciitis is the presence of gas in the subcutaneous tissues caused by gas-forming anaerobic organisms. In a study written by Yu and Habib, it is reported that the presence of gas in the subcutaneous tissues caused by gas-forming anaerobic organisms is a specific sign of NIF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【55】CT enables excellent and fast visualization of the subcutaneous gas and in the evaluation of this finding it is dramatically superior compared with MRI. On MRI gas collections result in focal foci of signal void both in T1-WI and T2-WI and it could be difficult to detect them.\n\n【56】Other CT findings in NIF include thickening of the affected fascia, fluid collections along the deep fascial sheaths, and extension of edema into the intramuscular septa and the muscles, findings that were present in the case we presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>.\n\n【57】To determine if necrosis is present the administration of contrast medium could be a helpful tool that helps to distinguish the necrotic fascial tissue from the nonnecrotic one. The literature shows evidences that when necrosis is present, on CECT in the delayed phase, a lack of the enhancement of the fascia could be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. In our case we performed an early venous phase, so we could not express any definitive consideration about the enhancement of the fascia.\n\n【58】Regarding the lack of enhancement of the fascia, we have also to say that it could not be considered as a certain predictor factor of necrosis. In fact in some studies, where the efficacy of the findings predictive of NIF was studied with MRI which is more contrast sensitive to CT, a lack of enhancement of the fascia was observed not just in the patients affected by NIF but also in some patients not affected by NIF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. So the lack of enhancement of the fascia, both on CECT and on MRI, could not be considered as a certain predictor factor of necrosis but should be considered as a suggestive predictive factor of necrosis according to the other radiological and clinical findings.\n\n【59】Soft tissue abscess presents a well-demarcated fluid collection with a peripheral pseudocapsule showing ring enhancement on CECT and due to these characteristics it could be easily distinguished from cellulitis and fasciitis.\n\n【60】On MRI soft tissue abscess shows low signal intensity (SI) on T1-WI and intermediate-high SI on T2-WI, sometimes with T2 hypointense lower SI layering debris. Thick peripheral rim enhancement, with or without a central hypointensity, in a case of abscess is present after contrast medium administration on T1-WI fat sat postcontrast sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Calcifications and gas collections could be also present in abscesses and the best technique to evaluate these two findings, as said before, is CT. MRI calcifications result in a signal loss in T2-WI and T1-WI but they are not easily and readily demonstrable as on CT. To evaluate the presence of edema, which could be present both in muscular infections and in abscesses, Short Time Inversion Recovery Sequences (STIR) should be performed. STIR sequences, which are T2-weighted sequences, reveal the presence of edema as an area with increased signal intensity compared to the normal tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【61】When there is an infectious myositis, on CT, there are enlargement and decreased attenuation of the affected muscle with effacement of surrounding planes. Involvement of a muscle group that is disproportionate to the involvement of subcutaneous tissue helps distinguish myositis from primary cellulitis. Intramuscular fluid collections can be also present in infectious myositis; the administration of contrast medium could help to differentiate necrotic from viable musculature and to demonstrate if a rim enhancing abscess is present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【62】On MRI in case of infectious pyomyositis, hyperintense focal lesions on T2-WI with massive perifocal edema resulting in a hyperintensity on the STIR sequences could be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【63】When there is an involvement of adjacent bone osteomyelitis can occur. A periosteal reaction, medullary low-attenuation areas, trabecular coarsening, and focal erosions are CT signs of osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【64】On CT, features of osteomyelitis include also soft tissue swelling, periosteal reaction, medullary low-attenuation areas or trabecular coarsening, and focal cortical erosions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【65】On MRI, in a case of acute osteomyelitis, sites of involved medullary bone appeared on T1-WI as areas of ill-defined homogenous, low to-intermediate signal intensity, and on T2-WI as areas of high signal intensity and as bright as or brighter than bone marrow. On T1-WI images there are accompanying areas of ill-defined intermediate signal intensity in the cortex and soft tissue and disruption on the normal high-intensity signal of the adjacent intramuscular septa and subcutaneous fat. These foci changed to high signal intensity on T2-WI images just as the lesions in the medullary canal had 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【66】Therefore the involvement and the thickening of the fascia, fluid collections, presence of subcutaneous gas, edema of the muscular septa, the involvement of the subcutaneous tissue, a nonenhancing fascia after contrast medium administration, and areas of low-attenuation in the muscles and among the soft tissues are all findings that together with the clinical history of the patient could suggest to the radiologist the presence of NIF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8–10\\]</u>. Other signs of systemic infection, such as pleural effusion or the hyperdensity of the fat mesenteric tissue, as seen in our case could be present in NIF when a systemic reaction is present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8–10\\]</u>.\n\n【67】In case of NIF, MRI imaging could be a useful tool in the evaluation of the precise extent of the infection and of its relations with the surrounding organs, to distinguish mild fascial or muscle involvement and to determine, with a higher sensibility compared to the CT scan, if necrosis and edema are present or not. Generally fat-suppressed T2-WI has been found to display inflammatory changes better than fat-suppressed gadolinium-enhanced T1-WI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. On MRI scan patients with NIF usually present thick (>3 mm) areas with abnormal high signal intensity on fat-suppressed T2-WI in the deep fascia, with a less frequency combined areas in superficial and deep fascia of low signal intensity on fat-sat T2-WI; a focal or diffuse nonenhancing portion in the area of the high abnormal signal intensity, in the deep fascia, in T1-WI fat sat postcontrast images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. Regarding the presence of a focal or diffuse nonenhancing portion after contrast medium administration on T1-WI fat-sat postcontrast images, it applies the considerations said above in the text.\n\n【68】MRI is a second stage exam that could be performed in all those doubt cases, after a first CECT evaluation, to distinguish NIF from non-NIF. MRI is dramatically inferior compared to CT in the evaluation of the presence of subcutaneous gas and calcifications. MRI is more contrast sensitive compared to CT; it permits a better evaluation of the precise extent of the disease and it offers an important diagnostic adjunct to the management of NIF and the potential to defer or limit extensive exposure of the deep fascia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. Nuclear imaging studies (99 mTC-Phosphate Complex and 67 Ga) are useful in those cases where a complication of osteomyelitis is suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【69】##### 3.3. Treatment and Prognosis\n\n【70】Once the diagnosis is made, treatment must begin on multiple fronts.\n\n【71】First, surgical consultation should be urgently requested with the intention of early wound debridement for collection of tissue cultures, excision of all nonviable and necrotic tissues should be done, and delineation of the extent of the disease tissues should be done. If the necrosis is present or strongly suspected, both with clinical examination and with the radiological findings, surgical debridement is mandatory.\n\n【72】In NIF a surgical debridement is mandatory; nonnecrotizing fasciitis does not require emergency surgery but affected patients should be monitored because of the potential necrosis.\n\n【73】Until blood culture results are available, wide spectrum antibiotic coverage with intravenous administration should be started.\n\n【74】The antibiotic should cover pyogenes, aureus, and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes as clinically indicated.\n\n【75】Hyperbaric oxygen has also been used as an adjunct to surgery and antibiotics.\n\n【76】Mortality due to NIF is considerable. Without surgical interventions, mortality approaches 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. More recent data indicate a mortality of 16,4% for community-acquired necrotizing soft tissue infections and 36,3% for postprocedural necrotizing fasciitis infections. Mortality is higher in patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and in diabetic patients.\n\n【77】A delay to surgery of more than 24 hours was an independent risk factor for mortality. There is also considerable postoperative morbidity, sometimes from extensive debridement resulting in muscle or limb loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【78】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【79】In conclusion, even if the diagnosis of NIF is both clinical and radiological, in the literature there are specific CT and MRI signs that allow the radiologist to distinguish NIF from non-NIF and from the most common musculoskeletal infections in order to perform a prompt surgical intervention when NIF is suspected.\n\n【80】Both techniques, CT and MRI, as said before have their weak and strength points, and as a general consideration we can say that CECT should be performed as first stage exam following with MRI in the doubt cases.\n\n【81】Some predisposing factors such as diabetes, previous surgery, or wounds in the skins should alert the radiologist of the possible presence of deep muscular infections.\n\n【82】The main goal for the radiologist at the emergency department when a deep muscular infection is suspected is to distinguish NIF from nonnecrotizing fasciitis and from other musculoskeletal infections and to evaluate the extension of the disease, the presence of necrosis if it is possible, and the disease complications both local and systemic.\n\n【83】#### 5\\.

Discussion\n\n【18】Dyspnea, arrhythmias, atypical chest pain, pericardial effusion, congestive heart failure, ventricular outflow tract obstruction, embolic events, or sudden cardiac death may be features of the cardiac hemangioma; however, it is commonly asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Echocardiography is the choice diagnostic imaging modality to suitably screen for cardiac tumors including cardiac hemangiomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging are complementary methods in the diagnostic workup of cardiac tumors for assessment of the scope of myocardial and local invasion. Coronary angiography will typically be an essential part of the preoperative evaluation to exclude obstructive coronary artery disease and to appraise the feeding arteries or disclose encasement of coronary vessels by the tumor. The natural history of cardiac hemangioma is changeable. It can continue to proliferate, die down to grow, or revert 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6, 7\\]</u>. Complete tumor excision is suggested for tissue diagnosis and impending cure, with a likely good long-term prognosis.

Median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass is generally necessary for intracardiac tumors.

Preoperative diagnosis of a cardiac hemangioma, however, comes to mind in a minority of cases. In our case, a cardiac tumor was diagnosed and the vascular nature of the tumor was supposed by vascular blush on the coronary angiography. In addition, right ventriculotomy was the approach of choice in our case because of its inaccessibility and its particular location.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This work aimed to describe a case series of children diagnosed with dengue presenting neurological disease in Huila Province of Colombia. Eleven pediatric febrile patients confirmed for dengue disease and presenting neurological signs were studied in the University Hospital of Neiva, Huila Province. Clinical and laboratory findings, CSF cytochemical analysis, neurology images, and serology and molecular studies were performed. Viral RNA was detected in all patients’ sera by RT-PCR. Nine out of 11 were primary infections. Tonic-clonic seizures (73%), consciousness alterations (27%), irritability (27%), and ataxia (18%) were the most frequent neurological signs. None of the patients had plasma leakage, hypovolemic shock, or liver disease, confirming the encephalitis diagnosis. Diagnostic images did not show abnormal findings, but neither bacterial nor fungal infections were detected in CSF analysis. All patients survived without sequelae except for one patient that presented ataxia for months. In conclusion, we described a group of children with neurological signs during severe dengue disease as the main finding, indicating the importance to including dengue as a differential diagnosis in neurological patients from endemic areas.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The world estimate of dengue infections is around 390 million people among symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in endemic countries such as those of Latin America and the Asian, Southeast, and Pacific Islands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Nearly 65% of Colombian municipalities reported constant Aedes infestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and dengue incidence increase year after year mainly associated with abnormal environmental sanitary conditions, broad circulation of the four serotypes, and high mosquito infestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. In America, most of the cases occur in individuals under 15 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The largest dengue occurred in Latin America was reported in 2019 with more than three million cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> reaching an incidence rate of 80 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n【5】The current disease classification propose is to identify dengue following clinical signs and symptoms to establish the most accurate diagnosis and recognize early cases that could become severe or fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Accordingly, dengue warning signs reflecting endothelial dysfunction that should be revised are abdominal tenderness, vomit, edema, mucosal bleeding, hepatomegaly, irritability, or hypotension. In those presumptive dengue cases occurring with plasma leakage signs (pleural effusion and pericarditis) or respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or affectation of organs such as the liver, brain, or kidney, a diagnostic of severe dengue should be corroborated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Even although neurological manifestations were reported since 1976 in Thailand as “dengue-associated acute encephalopathy” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, from these years until today, the incidence of neurologic manifestations during dengue disease has increased considerably 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Similar cases have been reported from the Asian, Southeast, and Pacific Islands of America 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Today, some hypotheses proposes that DENV could also be neurotropic as other flaviviruses supported by the frequent finding of specific IgM or viral RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u> that could confirm CNS infection and direct brain injury. This finding allows the differentiation of those circulating viruses and antibodies that could enter to the CNS due to impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).\n\n【7】Many kinds of pathologies have been reported, from cerebral edema and hemorrhage to perivascular lymphocyte infiltrates and demyelination foci. These anomalies could be explained by i) BBB alterations induced by TNF-alpha and IL-6 activity involved in endothelial junction disruption favoring virus entry to the CNS, ii) DENV infection to endothelial cells leading to virion pass through to brain parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>, and iii) endothelial cell injury by glycocalyx remodeling induced by NS1. Nervous system DENV replication has been observed in the olivary nucleus and cerebellum as well as tissue macrophages DENV positive, indicating some neurotropism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【8】It has been reported that 47% of adult meningitis and encephalitis cases in a Brazilian endemic area were explained by acute DENV infection occurring during the first week of fever onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. During that outbreak, the disorder did appear as encephalitis with behavioral disorders, seizures, and paresis with no evidence of liver failure and confirming serum or CSF IgM serology or altered neuroimages showing brain changes. Other cases with unspecific neurological signs could appear as a consequence of metabolic alterations or prolonged shock, brain hypoxia, cerebral edema, or liver or kidney failure that explain the headache, retro-orbital pain, insomnia, restlessness, and mood changes appearing in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The Colombian study reported by Mendez and Gonzalez 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> described 46 out of 168 severe dengue child patients presenting encephalopathy and 3 with encephalitis diagnostic. Dengue encephalitis is considered when febrile patients in endemic areas, having one of these signs or symptoms, headache, seizures, consciousness alterations, and behavioral changes with no hepatic failure or bleeding and positive for DENV serology or molecular test in serum or CSF with altered brain images in tomography or resonance. The purpose of this article is to present and describe the clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic characteristics of eleven children diagnosed as dengue cases, which presented neurological manifestations, cases occurring during regular endemic circulation in the Colombian province of Huila in 2011. DENV spreading in Latin-American countries and inside of them has been explained by air traffic between cities, urban population size, and human development index, which predict positively the outbreaks in those endemic cities like Neiva studied here (Allicock).\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Cases Presentation\n\n【10】The University Hospital Hernando Moncaleano is the largest health setting in Neiva, the capital city of Huila Province, located at 42 meters above sea level with a mean temperature of 28°C where it has been reported frequent dengue outbreaks. The Hospital Institutional Review Board approved the study and parents or guardians signed the consent form during the stay. We collected the clinical and laboratory information of those febrile patients with one of dengue symptoms such as rash, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, and arthralgia associated with any neurological signs such as seizures, abnormal movements, acute flaccid palsy, lethargy, meningeal signs, or consciousness alteration with no shock evidence, which were diagnosed as severe dengue following the recommendation of the WHO. Clinical records from the pediatric emergency department were revised from March to October 2011 and those patients with neurological signs and another microorganism associated were excluded. One specific designed clinical report form was filled for each case, and complete information of laboratory tests (blood cell counts, coagulation tests, liver, and kidney function markers), diagnostic images (tomography and chest Rx), and CSF chemical and microbiological analysis was collected; however, other viral pathogens were not evaluated. Sera from the enrolled cases were processed for serum IgM and capture IgG detection by ELISA and for viral RNA detection by RT-PCR on sera following the protocol described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【11】During the study period, 34 patients with fever and neurological manifestations were examined, but three were excluded (one by mental retardation and two with psychiatric disorders); the remaining 31 patients were investigated for dengue by serology or sera RT-PCR, and eleven (35.5%) tested positive for any of them (two girls and nine boys). All of them, finally, were discharged with severe dengue diagnostic or viral encephalitis, despite all of them having positive dengue IgM or IgG test in serum. All but one patient had laboratory analysis, although this one had serology and RT-PCR results. Most of the patients (73%) presented seizure disorder or convulsions. In Table 1, the complete data of patients are shown. Although all patients were IgM positive, only two were IgG positive (secondary infection). All sera were positive for RT-PCR for DENV, but only three of them allowed serotyping (DENV-1).\n\n【12】Table 1 Clinical and laboratory findings of evaluated patients.\n\n【13】Clinically, eight patients presented tonic-clonic seizures although only 2/11 reported headache and three developed consciousness alteration or irritability, two had ataxia symptoms, and one developed unilateral paresis. Other signs found were vomiting 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>, hepatomegaly 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>, cough 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>, abdominal pain 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>, asthenia 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>, and epistaxis 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. None of the patients presented plasma leakage signs such as edema or pleural effusion, nor altered transaminase values. There was brain tomography in eight patients and one magnetic resonance, all showing no alterations. Additionally, chest Rx from three patients was normal. Despite the severity, there was no fatal case, and all of them, but one, recovered without sequelae.\n\n【14】The hematimetric analysis indicated anemia and low hematocrit in all patients (median 33.5%, IQR 31.8-34.6%) since the child normal value is 36–42%. A mild leukocytosis was observed at day one and a decrease until day four when leukopenia was evident. Six patients developed thrombocytopenia with the day 6 value being the lowest (median 99.200 platelets/mm<sup>3</sup>). The coagulation prothrombin test only showed a mean of 15.4 s; it means a prolongation value at the first hospitalization day. However, the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was prolonged during six hospitalization days with values between 32.3 and 35.1 s . Transaminase levels used to evaluate the hepatic function and AST showed a slight increase during the last three hospitalization days (fifth to the seventh day), but the values were close to those reference levels while ALT did not show changed levels. There were no changes in renal function markers in any of the patients.\n\n【15】Table 2 Hematologic parameters description according to hospitalization day (mean (IQR) \\[n\\]).\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Colombia has seen an increase in the dengue cases number in the last decade with higher severity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>, forcing medical personnel and health authorities to strengthen capacity to recognize and differentiate classical dengue signs and symptoms from the atypical and severe presentation. After the redefinition of diagnostic and severity criteria by the WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>, severe dengue is defined when patients present organ damage, associated signs (liver, brain, and kidney), or hypovolemic shock or massive bleeding. This system facilitates the early recognition of the most severe cases by reducing the mortality numbers.\n\n【18】This study presented eleven severe dengue cases in children between eight months to 10 years of age, living in the Colombian province Huila, a hyperendemic area that reported two-fifths of severe dengue cases registered from 2000 to 2011 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. All patients presented brain compromise; nine were diagnosed as not only encephalitis (81.8%) following the criteria described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>, such as fever, sensory disturbances, seizures, or focal neurological signs, but also positive tests (IgM or NS1) or RT-PCR in serum or CSF and negative for others encephalitis causes. This presentation was the most common compromise in this series, characterized by seizures in six patients (tonic-clonic convulsions) as has been previously reported in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. There was one severe sensory impairment case, and another presented with severe headache, which also is frequently described in dengue encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Less than half of the described patients develop classical dengue signs such as vomiting, hepatomegaly, and exanthem, indicating the neurological cases do not seem to have dengue disease and that nervous signs could appear alone leading to registration of severe cases and possibly in the delay of the establishment of adequate treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Two patients were diagnosed as cerebellitis, characterized by nystagmus, dysarthria, or ataxia, which also has been reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Fortunately, there were no fatal cases in this patient group; on the contrary, outcomes and recovery were satisfactory.\n\n【19】It is recommended that, in DENV circulation areas, those patients with fever and neurologic signs should be investigated for dengue disease, ensuring laboratory confirmation using both serology and molecular tests that, together, could offer high sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Here, we used both IgM and IgG serology in addition to RT-PCR and found all serum samples positive, even serotyping DENV-1 in three patients, which is not the most reported associated with neuroinfection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. The finding of nine sera negative for IgG is very odd because most of the severe dengue cases are during secondary infections with a different serotype, where the antibodies are not capable of the second virus neutralization but induce an enhanced infection and an aberrant immune response. Therefore, severe dengue with a primary compromise of an organ in primoinfection could suggest a neurotropic strain or a host characteristic that determined the neuroinfection in this child group.\n\n【20】All CSF samples were negative for bacteria or fungi, but five out of nine had lymphocyte pleocytosis, an uncommon sign in dengue encephalitis; since most of the cases do not develop CSF anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>, even three-quarters of dengue encephalitis or meningitis patients showed normal values in CSF analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Despite previous studies reported that brain tissue damage is detectable by tomography images, the children described in this work did not present anomalies. Although it is preferable to use magnetic resonance for brain evaluation because of the accuracy of this technique, regularly imaging abnormalities during dengue encephalitis are not specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> and are still poorly defined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 30\\]</u>, although ischemia or hemorrhage must be sought 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. On the other hand, we found normal leukocyte counts instead of the classical leukopenia of dengue with warning signs or severe dengue, which pose a difficulty to early diagnosis, although there was thrombocytopenia only at day six of hospitalization with no changes in ALT and AST transaminases as reported previously. Recently, 11/36 patients from a Brazilian endemic area were diagnosed with neurologic manifestations and confirmed for arbovirus infection using CSF or sera 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u> (5 DENV and 6 CHIKV), posing an additional warning about involvement of these viruses in severe disease presentation in Latin-American countries where there is cocirculation.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【22】This child group were diagnosed as severe dengue with central nervous system manifestations without shock, typical signs, or hemorrhage. Therefore, we should recommend that, in endemic dengue areas, health professionals should include infections by this virus in those patients with fever and neurological manifestations as part of the primary diagnostic and must be vigilant for neurological signs that could appear after acute dengue disease.\n\n【23】#### 5\\. Limitations\n\n【24】This study was retrospective and is limited by its observational nature. Although we enrolled almost all those children with severe dengue diagnosis in this hospital, detailed clinical and laboratory information was obtained from these reported patients after an in-depth search of data in the medical records.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It was subsequently found that the SFT had metastasized to the brain by additional pathology, and not the predicted adenocarcinoma. SFTs are a rare mesenchymal neoplasm that accounts for less than 2% of all reported soft tissue tumors. SFTs most commonly arise in the thoracic cavity, but are frequently found in various locations throughout the body, and rarely metastasize to the brain. This case highlights that rare neoplasms, such as SFT, should not be ruled out as a potential cause of metastasis. Due to the rarity of this clinical situation, we also provide a review and discussion of previously reported SFT cases and the use of postoperative radiation therapy. The optimal treatment for individual patients remains unclear in this unique situation. Surgical resection followed by adjuvant Gamma Knife radiation therapy to the surgical bed appears to be a safe option for local treatment of SFT in select patients. Further studies are needed of this rare clinical situation in order to better understand and optimize future treatments for patients with SFT and metastasis to the brain.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】We present a unique case of a patient with simultaneously diagnosed solitary fibrous tumor of the lung and adenocarcinoma of the lung, and who was later found to have a single solitary fibrous tumor metastasis to the brain. This patient underwent surgical resection for the brain metastasis followed by Gamma Knife treatment to the surgical cavity. At this time, there are no other reported cases in the literature with this specific course of treatment for the single brain metastasis from solitary fibrous tumor pathology.\n\n【4】Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms that account for less than 2% of all reported soft tissue tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. SFTs are most commonly benign, but 10–20% of cases have been reported to be malignant. SFTs usually occur in middle-aged patients and equally in men and women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The most common sites for metastasis are the lungs (61%), pleura (49%), liver (41%), bones (41%), and peritoneum (41%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. SFT has a low reported incidence of metastasis to the brain, especially low when compared to lung adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】The patient is a 70-year-old male Navy veteran who served on the Mekong in Vietnam for 14 months, during which time he reports that he was exposed to Agent Orange. He has a previous history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass grafting in 2015, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from tobacco.\n\n【7】He presented with progressive shortness of breath and underwent a workup with CT scan of the chest without contrast, which revealed two distinct appearing tumors, one in the right upper lobe with a tumor size of 1.5 cm and another in the right lower lung with a tumor size of 13 cm . He underwent a right upper lobe wedge resection and a right lower lobectomy for these tumors. Pathology revealed two distinct neoplasms. The right upper lobe tumor was a moderately differentiated lung adenocarcinoma, stage pT2a . Pathology revealed focal invasion of the visceral pleura, confirmed by elastic stain.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Noncontrast CT chest, coronal view.

The mitotic rate was significantly elevated at 13 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields . Multiple fields of necrosis were also identified. Immunohistochemical stains were performed, which revealed reactivity for CD34 and Bcl-2. The tumor was negative for pancytokeratin. This tumor did not extend beyond the lung parenchyma. A routine sampling of the right lower paratracheal (4R), subcarinal 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>, paraesophageal 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u>, and right hilar (10R) lymph nodes was negative for metastatic disease from either tumor. The surgical margins were negative for tumor in both cases. Thus, no additional therapy was recommended at that time. He was followed with clinical visits and imaging studies.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Hematoxylin and Eosin, low-power 100x view of solitary fibrous tumor.

However, a restaging CT chest with contrast showed multiple new pulmonary tumors. Shortly after this CT scan was performed, he presented with mild right leg weakness. MRI of the brain showed a solitary 2.5 cm enhancing mass of the left posterior frontal lobe, just anterior to the motor cortex, with extensive surrounding edema . The timing of his new symptoms and the imaging findings were consistent with a metastatic brain lesion.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 T1 postgadolinium MRI brain with axial view.

The brain resection pathology revealed a malignant solitary fibrous tumor. It appeared similar to the SFT resected from the lung. It was comprised of spindled cells with storiform and haphazard arrangement. The tumor matrix was predominantly myxoid, and the cells were fed by a rich vascular network of small slit-like vessels and large ectatic branching vessels . The tumor showed immunoreactivity for CD34, Bcl-2, and STAT-6. The Ki-67 proliferation index approached 30%. His case was discussed at the regional multidisciplinary brain tumor board where the consensus recommends radiosurgery. He underwent single fraction Gamma Knife radiosurgery to the tumor cavity with a prescription dose of 22 Gy to the 50% isodose line . His weakness subsequently resolved.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8 Postresection, T1 postgadolinium MRI brain with axial view.

He was prescribed systemic treatment with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and Alimta and tolerated systemic therapy well but does continue to have generalized weakness, generalized dyspnea on exertion, and a chronic dry cough. At the time of this report, it has been 16 months since the Gamma Knife treatment and he has not developed subsequent recurrence of brain metastasis. He continues to receive treatment with pembrolizumab.\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】This is an unusual case of routine adenocarcinoma of the lung, but also SFT of the lung. Furthermore, the patient developed a symptomatic solitary brain metastasis from the SFT, not the lung adenocarcinoma, even more unusual and unexpected.\n\n【25】SFTs are rare mesenchymal neoplasms that account for less than 2% of all reported soft tissue tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, first reported in the literature by Wagner in 1870 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. SFTs were originally thought to only arise in the thoracic cavity, but it is now known that while most SFTs are intrathoracic and usually from the pleura, these tumors are frequently found in various locations throughout the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Peritoneal cavities, usually the retroperitoneum or pelvic soft tissue, are the primary site of origin in 30% of SFTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. 20% occur in the head and neck, the meninges, or extracranial locations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–12\\]</u>. These can include the sinonasal tract, oral cavity, and orbit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. There have also been cases of SFT arising from the extremities and bone as well as very few reported from the abdominal wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>. SFTs are most commonly benign, but 10–20% of cases have been reported to be malignant. SFTs usually occur in middle-aged patients and equally in men and women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The most common sites for metastasis are the lungs (61%), pleura (49%), liver (41%), bones (41%), and peritoneum (41%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. SFT has a low reported incidence of metastasis to the brain, especially low when compared to lung adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【26】SFTs are usually considered chemoresistant; therefore, localized treatments with surgery or radiation therapy are the most common modalities used. Initially, surgery is most effective, and tumor removal with negative margins of 1 to 2 cm, if possible, is recommended. Complete surgical resection of localized lesions is thought to be important for optimal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Though the literature is inconclusive about the most effective use, radiotherapy is a good adjuvant treatment before or after surgery in more complex conditions, such as in the case of an incomplete resection or if the tumor is inoperable. We have previously published clinical outcomes after radiosurgery or whole brain radiation for brain metastasis of various histologic types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. Radiation therapy is especially utilized in cases with malignant SFT, narrow margins, tumor size greater than 10 cm, and fast-growing tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. For example, in an analysis of 102 SFT cases, Krengli et al. reported that local control was higher in patients who were treated with surgery plus postoperative radiation therapy when compared to surgery alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. If the tumor has metastasized, adjuvant radiation therapy and sometimes chemotherapy are also used. However, Duranti et al. summarized their treatment of 337 patients with localized thoracic soft tissue sarcoma, where 51% received adjuvant radiotherapy and 41% received postoperative chemotherapy, and concluded the patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy presented with better local control than those who received adjuvant chemotherapy alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【27】When compared to brain metastasis from adenocarcinoma, brain metastasis from SFT is significantly less common. In a study of 16,210 patients with brain metastasis, the authors reported that brain metastasis from lung cancers (19.9%) occurs more frequently when compared to other types of cancer, such as melanoma (6.9%), renal (6.5%), breast (5.1%), and colorectal (1.8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Another study reported similar outcomes with a higher incidence of brain metastasis in lung cancer (16.3%) when compared to renal carcinoma (9.8%), melanoma (7.4%), breast carcinoma (5.0%), and colorectal carcinoma (1.2%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Of lung cancers, a study of 485 cases of patients with lung cancer by Villano et al. reported that the highest occurrence of brain metastasis was from adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. In addition, in a 2018 study of 373 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung, brain metastasis was reported to be one of the most common sites of distant metastasis and have a significantly higher rate of brain metastasis than other types of non-small-cell lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The relatively high metastatic rate to the brain from adenocarcinoma of the lung is historically documented in that a study published in 1988 reported brain metastasis in 28% of their 259 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【28】SFT has a much lower incidence of brain metastasis than adenocarcinoma. In a study of 139 patients with SFT (49 of which had metastases), O’Neill et al. reported that the most common sites of metastasis were the lungs (61%), pleura (49%), liver (41%), bones (41%), and peritoneum (41%). Only 8 of their 49 patients with metastases had brain metastases. The authors report that 5 patients had multiple brain metastases while 3 patients had single brain metastases. Six of the patients with brain metastases had tumors located extraaxially, 1 had extraaxially, and 1 had both extraaxially and intraaxially. The metastases were hypervascular in half of the patients, and the largest diameter was 1.4 cm (range, 0.5–2.8 cm). O’Neill et al. stated that brain metastases were most commonly from head and neck primary SFT, as seen in 5 patients, but also arose from 2 patients with thoracic SFT and 1 with abdominal SFT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Very few brain metastases from SFT have been reported in the literature.\n\n【29】Surgical excision generally yields a good prognosis for most SFT patients, as seen in a study by Gold et al. of 75 patients with SFTs in a wide range of anatomic sites. The authors reported that the factors predicting worse prognosis include positive surgical margins, large tumor size greater than 10 cm, and the presence of a histologically malignant component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Another study by van Houdt et al. similarly found that the variables most correlated with local recurrence and worse prognosis overall included positive resection margin, tumor size greater than 10 cm, and high mitosis rate. Five years after surgical resection of the 81 patients they followed, overall survival was 84%, local recurrence rate was 29%, and metastasis rate was 34% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Franzen et al. also emphasized the importance of a high mitotic index in recurrence and worse prognosis after following 42 SFT patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. A study by Tapias et al. reviews 59 patients with surgical treatment of SFT of the pleura (SFTP), one of the most common anatomical locations of SFT, to propose a score that can help predict recurrence of SFTP and guide postoperative surveillance. They report that their scoring system was better at predicting malignant behavior and recurrence than some other scores, such as England’s criteria or de Perrot staging. Their predictive score focuses on factors including mitotic activity, necrosis, sessile morphology, presence of hypercellularity, and size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. However, Franzen et al. in their study found the factors of tumor necrosis and sessile morphology to be statistically insignificant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Localized treatment for primary tumor typically consists of surgery with or without radiotherapy for SFT. SFT can be chemoresistant, or chemotherapy may have inconsistent effects in some patients, but a study at MD Anderson concludes that conventional chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin-based therapy, gemcitabine-based therapy, and paclitaxel, can be helpful in controlling or stabilizing locally advanced and metastatic SFT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Another study at MD Anderson reported that combination therapy with temozolomide and bevacizumab was well tolerated and almost as beneficial as surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. However, surgical excision still remains the treatment of choice. van Houdt et al. reported the factor most significantly correlated with local recurrence is the positive resection margin with a hazard ratio of 4.8 (confidence interval 95%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Compared to patients with a negative margin, patients with a positive resection margin have a statistically significant higher risk of local recurrence. In a study of 220 cases reported of intracranial and intraspinal SFT, Bisceglia et al. recommends surgery as the main treatment as well as stereotactic and external beam radiotherapy for unresectable tumors and some cases of postsurgical tumor remnants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Adjuvant radiotherapy is also often used for cases with extensive external invasion. In a very recent study, Bishop et al. reviewed 31 patients treated for SFT in multiple anatomic sites using both surgery and radiation therapy and reported 5-year rates of local control, overall survival, and distant metastatic-free survival as 100%, 95%, and 92%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. In another very recent study including 14 SFT patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy, Jia et al. also recommends adjuvant radiotherapy to lower recurrence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【31】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【32】We present a unique case of a patient with simultaneously diagnosed solitary fibrous tumor of the right lung and adenocarcinoma of the right lung, and who was later found to have a solitary fibrous tumor metastasis to the brain with a single left frontal lobe lesion. This patient received neurosurgical resection for the brain metastasis followed by Gamma Knife treatment to the surgical cavity.

Some coexisting conditions which cause pain similar to sickle cell disease may go undiagnosed in these patients. We report two adults with concurrent hyperparathyroidism who experienced significant improvement in sickle cell pain following parathyroidectomy thereby pointing to hyperparathyroidism as the principal causative factor for their pain. Meticulous evaluation for parathyroid disorders can be rewarding in sickle cell disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder which affects approximately 100,000 Americans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This disease is characterized by production of an abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) molecule which polymerizes into long chains when deoxygenated. This leads to deformation of red blood cells (RBCs) into their characteristic sickle shape. Vasoocclusion by sickle shaped RBCs and their hemolysis are the hallmarks of SCD. Acute and chronic body pains which are common clinical symptoms in SCD are understood to be due to vasoocclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. All painful events in SCD may not be sickle cell related. Other systemic disorders including some endocrine disorders like hyperparathyroidism which commonly cause musculoskeletal pain may present concurrently with SCD. Here we report two patients with concurrently occurring hyperparathyroidism who experienced amelioration of sickle cell pain following parathyroidectomy. There is a prior case report of primary hyperparathyroidism mimicking vasoocclusive crises in a pediatric patient with homozygous sickle cell (HBSS) disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our case report exemplifies that the benefit of decrease in painful episodes following treatment of hyperparathyroidism may be seen in other genotypes like sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia. We also report a similar benefit following treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism due to end stage renal disease occurring concurrently in a patient with HBSS disease.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】Baseline characteristics of the two patients at the time of diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【6】Table 1 Hb: hemoglobin, HPLC: high performance liquid chromatography, HbS: sickle cell hemoglobin, HbF: fetal hemoglobin, HbA and HbA2: adult hemoglobin, and PTH: parathyroid hormone.\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Case Report 1\n\n【8】Our first case is a 59-year-old female patient who moved to USA from Haiti two years ago with a diagnosis of sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia. She reported having generalized pain almost on a daily basis which she managed at home with pain medications. She had frequent hospital visits for generalized painful crises as many as twice a month of which some required inpatient treatment. We analyzed her case in detail after one such prolonged admission for 15 days especially as the severity of her presentations for painful crises was unusual given her sickle cell genotype.\n\n【9】High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) showed HbA of 22.4%, HbA2 of 7%, HbS of 65.4%, and HbF of 5.2% consistent with a diagnosis of sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia. Hemogram showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 4.3, Hb of 9.8 grams/deciliter (g/dL), and platelet (Plt) count of 158. Blood chemistry was significant for elevated calcium (Ca) on multiple occasions with a peak of 12.7 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL). Phosphate was low on multiple occasions with a nadir of 1.9 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was elevated on multiple occasions with a peak of 147 picograms/milliliter (range 14–72 pg/mL). Vitamin D levels ranged from 18 to 23 nanograms/milliliter (range 30–100 ng/mL). Based on the above investigations we reached a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).\n\n【10】Patient underwent imaging studies to localize the parathyroid lesion. Radionuclide parathyroid imaging using technetium sestamibi scan revealed slow washout in the right mid thyroid region  and computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck without contrast revealed a soft tissue mass posterior to mid pole of the right thyroid lobe  both favoring a diagnosis of adenoma of the right inferior parathyroid gland. She also had intermittent upper abdominal pain which was confirmed on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to be due to severe gastritis.\n\n【11】Patient underwent focused parathyroidectomy of the right inferior parathyroid gland which was confirmed on histopathologic examination to be a parathyroid adenoma. Intraoperative PTH monitoring was not used in this case. Patient’s calcium and PTH levels normalized following surgery and are shown in Figures 1 and 2. At 6-month follow-up calcium level was 9.7 mg/dL and PTH was 28.4 pg/mL confirming cure of PHPT. Following successful treatment of PHPT, she has not had any sickle cell related painful events and has not required emergency room (ER) visits or hospitalizations over the last year.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Perioperative PTH monitoring, POPTH (postoperative PTH), and Pg/mL (picograms/milliliter).</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Perioperative calcium monitoring, POCa (postoperative calcium), and Mg/dL (milligrams/deciliter).</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Radionuclide parathyroid imaging using technetium Tc-99m sestamibi showingslow washout in the right mid thyroid region (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 CT scan of the neck without contrast showing a soft tissue mass posterior to mid pole of the right thyroid lobe (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【16】##### 2.2. Case Report 2\n\n【17】Our second case is a 26-year-old male patient with homozygous sickle cell (HBSS) disease. He also had chronic kidney disease which progressed over 3 to 4 years to end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. Patient had frequent presentations for painful crises amounting to 16 ER visits and 82 inpatient days in the preceding year at our institution. His painful crises were notably more frequent since he developed ESRD and were localized in his hips and collar bones.\n\n【18】Most recent HPLC showed HbA of 81.8%, HbF < 1%, HbA2 of 2.7%, and HbS of 14.5% indicating that patient had recently received multiple blood transfusions. Hemogram showed WBC count of 12, Hb of 7.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 333. Blood chemistry was significant for elevated Ca on multiple occasions with a peak of 11.8 mg/dL. Phosphate was high on multiple occasions with a peak of 9.1 mg/dL. PTH was elevated on multiple occasions with a peak of 4078 pg/mL. Vitamin D levels ranged from 13 to 20 ng/mL. Predialysis blood urea nitrogen ranged from 60 to 80 mg/dL and creatinine ranged from 8 to 10 mg/dL. Patient was treated with cinacalcet for secondary hyperparathyroidism but became refractory to treatment after a period of time with persistently elevated calcium and PTH levels. Based on the above investigations, we reached a diagnosis of tertiary hyperparathyroidism due to ESRD.\n\n【19】Imaging studies were done to localize the parathyroid lesion. Radionuclide parathyroid imaging using technetium sestamibi scan showed slow washout in the right lower thyroid region  but CT scan of the neck with contrast showed moderately enhancing foci inferior to the left and right thyroid lobes and superior to the left thyroid lobe which raised suspicion of parathyroid hyperplasia and warranted exploration of all four parathyroid glands. Plain radiography revealed bony resorption typical of untreated hyperparathyroid bone disease at the greater trochanters of both femoral bones and lateral ends of both clavicles which were the locations of his pain .\n\n【20】Four-gland exploration and parathyroidectomy were performed and a portion of one gland was reimplanted in the left sternohyoid region. Histopathology showed parathyroid hyperplasia of all the resected glands. Intraoperative PTH monitoring was used as shown in Figures 5 and 6. At 6-month follow-up calcium level was 9.1. Since this patient underwent parathyroidectomy, his frequency and severity of painful crises have decreased significantly. He has had only 3 ER visits and a total of 8 inpatient days for painful crises in the year following parathyroidectomy which is significantly lower than before the surgery.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Perioperative PTH monitoring, IOPTH (intraoperative PTH), POPTH (postoperative PTH), and Pg/mL (picograms/milliliter).</u>\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 Perioperative calcium monitoring, IOCa (intraoperative calcium), POCa (postoperative calcium), and Mg/dL (milligrams/deciliter).</u>\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 Radionuclide parathyroid imaging using technetium Tc-99m sestamibi showingslow washout in the right lower thyroid region (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8 Bony resorption of greater trochanters of both femoral bones typical of untreated hyperparathyroid bone disease at the locations of the patient’s pain (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 9 Bone resorption of the lateral ends of both clavicles (denoted by arrow).</u>\n\n【26】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【27】Vasoocclusive episodes in SCD involve multiple organs with musculoskeletal system being most commonly affected. Some patients have acute generalized body pain while others have localized bony pain resulting from bone infarcts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The long bones are most commonly affected followed by ribs, sternum, and vertebral bodies. The pain may range from mild to very severe. Many individuals with SCD also suffer from long term consequences of vasoocclusive pain episodes in the musculoskeletal system, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral heads or collapsed vertebral bodies. This leads to a chronic state of pain in addition to the more acute painful episodes. Pain symptoms are a major cause of morbidity and affect quality of life in these patients. These symptoms result in multiple ER visits and hospitalizations. They are managed with pain medications, intravenous fluids, and blood transfusions as needed along with treatment of the underlying trigger. SCD may be associated with endocrine disorders like hyperparathyroidism which also cause generalized body pains. It is important to identify and treat these disorders for an optimal outcome and not to dismiss all pain symptoms in these patients as being due to SCD.\n\n【28】Hyperparathyroidism may be primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is due to oversecretion of PTH most commonly from a parathyroid adenoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Most new patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis with PHPT. Biochemical tests that include measurement of serum calcium currently account for identification of at least 80 percent of patients with PHPT in western countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The classical symptoms of PHPT are due to combined effects of increased PTH and calcium. Complaints of weakness and fatigue are common among patients with PHPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Other manifestations include nephrolithiasis, bone disease, constipation, polyuria, and polydipsia. There is a wide spectrum of involvement of the skeletal system in hyperparathyroidism. Effects can range from generalized bone pains to asymptomatic patients with decreased bone densitometry and increased risk of fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism occur in patients with chronic kidney disease. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by severe parathyroid hyperplasia with autonomous secretion of PTH that is no longer adequately responsive to the plasma calcium concentration. This causes high bone turnover and abnormal mineralization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Musculoskeletal symptoms from hyperparathyroidism can be difficult to distinguish from those in patients with concurrent SCD.\n\n【29】There are variations in clinical presentation among the different sickle cell genotypes with homozygous HBSS disease and heterozygous sickle cell-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia patients being the more severely affected ones. In HBSS disease fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a major modulator of polymerization in that the higher the HbF levels, the more benign the clinical and hematologic features of sickle cell anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Some heterozygous sickle cell variants like sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia and HBSC disease generally have a more benign clinical course. In sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia, normal adult hemaoglobin (HbA) accounts for 18 to 25 percent of total hemoglobin which prevents extensive polymerization. Similarly, in HBSC disease, HBC hemoglobin does not participate in polymerization. Therefore, in both these variants painful events occur at less than half the freuency as the HBSS type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Our first patient with sickle cell-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia was having more frequent painful episodes than expected for her genotype. This prompted us to investigate for other coexisting illnesses and we reached a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The marked improvement in her pain symptoms following resection of the parathyroid adenoma made it clear that hyperparathyroidism had been partially responsible for the pain symptoms.\n\n【31】Our second patient with HBSS disease and ESRD received multiple transfusions for symptomatic anemia not responding to erythropoietin. Though his HbA was >80%, he did not have the benign course in terms of painful events which would be expected with low HbS levels of 14.5%. This led us to evaluate for other coexisting pathologies for his musculoskeletal pain. There were radiological features of untreated hyperparathyroid bone disease at the locations of his pain. There was bone resorption of greater trochanters of both femoral bones and lateral ends of the clavicles but there were no bone infarcts or avascular necrosis of the femoral heads as would be anticipated in SCD . These radiological findings along with analysis of the case as described above led to our conclusion that hyperparathyroidism was more likely than SCD to be the cause of his frequent painful episodes.\n\n【32】Patients with phenotypic manifestations which are incongruous with their genotype, that is, more severe and frequent pain symptoms in a milder sickle cell variant, should be investigated for concurrent systemic disorders which can contribute to their pain. Similarly frequent or persistent painful episodes despite relatively normal markers of active sickle disease like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reticulocyte count, and bilirubin should also prompt further investigations. Notable findings in our first patient include LDH, reticulocyte percentage, and bilirubin levels which stayed at baseline during painful events over a 22-month period which is unlike that seen in sickle cell crises .\n\n【33】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 10 Graphs showing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reticulocyte percentage, and total bilirubin levels in the first patient.</u>\n\n【34】The improvement in sickle cell pain in our two patients following parathyroidectomy points towards hyperparathyroidism being the predominant cause of their pain. Further studies need to be done to see if there is a potential causal relationship between the two conditions. There are other potential benefits of treatment of hyperparathyroidism in patients with SCD. Patients with SCD have a high rate of vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Concurrent hyperparathyroidism causing a high bone turnover may worsen osteoporosis in patients with SCD. Treatment of hyperparathyroidism in appropriate cases with parathyroidectomy will help prevent long term bone damage. In addition it is expected that there will be an improvement in muscle strength following parathyroidectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. There may also be an added benefit in preventing opioid dependence in this subset of patients whose pain is commonly attributed to sickle cell disease.\n\n【35】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【36】Hyperparathyroidism can occur concurrently with sickle cell disease and can cause symptoms which mimic sickle cell painful events. Timely diagnosis and treatment of hyperparathyroidism can have beneficial effects in patients with sickle cell disease.\n\n【37】#### Disclosure\n\n【38】This case series review was conducted at New York City Health and Hospitals/Kings County, Brooklyn, New York, USA.\n\n【39】#### Competing Interests\n\n【40】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

One of these adverse events is agranulocytosis, which, although rare, can be life-threatening if left untreated. The majority of agranulocytosis cases are caused by drugs, including antibiotics. Here, we report a case of severe agranulocytosis in a 96-year-old woman following antibiotic therapy which was successfully managed using recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and the appropriate choice of antibiotics to treat her concomitant infection.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Agranulocytosis is a rare and life-threatening condition, with an annual incidence of 1.1 to 4.9 cases per million population per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Up to 50% of agranulocytosis may be induced by nonchemotherapy drugs, such as antithyroid agents and antimicrobial medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The risk for developing this adverse event may be higher among elderly patients in Japan, who are often prescribed many types of medication, a phenomenon called polypharmacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The problem of polypharmacy is of particular concern in an aging society like Japan because elderly patients tend to have many underlying diseases as well as conditions that require various medications. We herein present a case of severe agranulocytosis following antibiotic treatment with garenoxacin and ceftriaxone. The patient was also prescribed 10 different kinds of medication regularly, making this a case that emphasizes the importance of recognizing severe drug-related adverse events and the potential danger of polypharmacy or unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 96-year-old woman was prescribed garenoxacin for 8 days after complaining of a bad cough, dyspnea, and anorexia at a nearby clinic. This was despite a simple laboratory blood test revealing a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7920/μL (55% neutrophils) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 0.33 mg/dL, findings that were unremarkable. However, she developed high-grade fever on the following day, and intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g daily for 6 days) was added to her treatment regime two days after prescribing garenoxacin. After 5 days of therapy with ceftriaxone, a follow-up laboratory blood test performed showed a WBC count of 1050/μL (0% neutrophils) and a CRP level of 6.67 mg/dL. Severe leucopenia was suspected, and she was referred to our hospital for evaluation.\n\n【7】During presentation, her blood pressure was 136/99 mmHg, her pulse rate was 87 beats per minute, and her body temperature was 37.4°C. Her respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute and peripheral oxygen saturation 97%. Chest sounds were normal, and other findings of physical examination were unremarkable. She was 150 cm in height with mild kyphosis and weighed 40 kg. She had a medical history of atrial fibrillation, stroke, hypertension, hypotonic urinary bladder, lower back pain, and gastritis. Her daily medications included candesartan, lansoprazole, amlodipine, carbocysteine, zaltoprofen, tranexamic acid, rivaroxaban, bisoprolol, brotizolam, and celecoxib.\n\n【8】Full blood count performed at our hospital revealed severe leucopenia with a WBC count of 830/µL (neutrophils 7/µL, eosinophils 8/μL, basophils 18/μL, monocytes 378/μL, and lymphocytes 415/μL). Other laboratory data are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph and computed tomography showed mild infiltrative shadow on her left lung. However, both blood and sputum culture results were negative.\n\n【9】Table 1 Laboratory data on admission.\n\n【10】She was diagnosed with drug-induced agranulocytosis (presumably from antibiotics used) with mild pneumonia and admitted to an isolated room. Candesartan, lansoprazole, amlodipine, and celecoxib were discontinued because they are also known to cause agranulocytosis. She was given meropenem hydrate intravenously (2 g/day) and levofloxacin hydrate orally (500 mg/day) for 10 days, after which a short course of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (4 g/day) was administered. Subcutaneous injection of filgrastim (recombinant human G-CSF, 75 µg/day) was also given to treat her neutropenia.\n\n【11】Filgrastim was administered for 6 days before the neutrophil count normalized to 2539/µL on day 6. Although her neutrophil count increased to 12,940/µL on day 9, it eventually stabilized around 3000 to 4000/µL after day 13. Table 2 summarizes the changes in WBC count, neutrophil count, and CRP levels during her hospitalization. Her fever receded after day 10, and she was discharged on day 18 without further complications.\n\n【12】Table 2 Change in laboratory data after admission.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Although there is no clear consensus, polypharmacy may be defined as the concomitant use of five or more medications per day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Polypharmacy is a major concern in Japan as older patients such as ours are often given many different medications (10 in our patient) on a regular basis. The fact that patients have easy access to different specialists in Japan also increases the probability of polypharmacy as they often see many physicians without a primary care doctor carefully monitoring their medications. Furthermore, our patient was prescribed antibiotics, which may be due to her old age and the risk of developing pneumonia, after presenting with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The questionable practice of treating acute respiratory infections with antibiotics is still common in Japan. Lack of proper patient education has resulted in increased patient satisfaction when they are prescribed antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Studies have also demonstrated that the use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections does not result in increased adverse events and may even be slightly beneficial in preventing pneumonia hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Nevertheless, a recent study showed that older female patients as well as those with multiple comorbidities and medications (which fit our patient’s profile) have the highest risk of adverse drug reactions in the acute care setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This includes life-threatening conditions such as agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis, although rare, can be caused by many different drugs, including antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>. Without early detection, this condition may result in serious infections and subsequently sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our patient’s case, due to the timing and development of her agranulocytosis, we believe that it was most probably caused by garenoxacin or ceftriaxone, either directly or through interactions with her other drugs.\n\n【16】Currently, the standard treatment for drug-induced agranulocytosis is discontinuation of the responsible agent(s), antibiotic treatment if the presence of infection is suspected, and proper use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Although their efficacy is not conclusively proven, G-CSF has minimal toxicity and may be beneficial in the management of drug-induced agranulocytosis in elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Minor complications include bone pain and leukocytosis, which occurred in our patient but normalized after discontinuing therapy. As for antibiotic treatment, cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) is often employed as a first-line therapy for agranulocytosis with infection. Meropenem can be used as an alternative when cefepime is not tolerated well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. A recent study also demonstrated that, for severe cases (neutrophil count < 100/µL), meropenem may be the superior choice for monotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Meropenem was used due to the severely low neutrophil count and also because our patient’s agranulocytosis may have been caused by ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin).\n\n【17】In conclusion, we reported a case of severe agranulocytosis in an elderly patient which was managed successfully using rhG-CSF and proper choice of antibiotics. Elderly patients who are being prescribed many different medications need to be carefully managed and monitored for various adverse drug events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Although the symptoms of COVID-19 are mainly respiratory ones, the infection is associated with a wide range of clinical signs and symptoms. The main imaging modality in COVID-19 is lung computed tomography (CT) scanning, but the diagnosis of the vast spectrum of complications needs the application of various imaging modalities. Owing to the novelty of the disease and its presentations, its complications—particularly uncommon ones—can be easily missed. In this study, we describe some uncommon presentations of COVID-19 diagnosed by various imaging modalities. The first case presented herein was a man with respiratory distress, who transpired to suffer from pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in addition to the usual pneumonia of COVID-19. The second patient was a hospitalized COVID-19 case, whose clinical condition suddenly deteriorated with the development of abdominal symptoms diagnosed as mesenteric ischemia by abdominal CT angiography. The third patient was a case of cardiac involvement in the COVID-19 course, detected as myocarditis by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The fourth and fifth cases were COVID-19-associated encephalitis whose diagnoses were established by brain MRI. COVID-19 is a multisystem disorder with a wide range of complications such as pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, mesenteric ischemia, myocarditis, and encephalitis. Prompt diagnosis with appropriate imaging modalities can lead to adequate treatment and better survival.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

The responsible viral pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), seems to use its notorious spike proteins to bind with the receptors of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is mostly expressed in pulmonary and cardiac cells, making the lungs and the heart the major targets for SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Noncontrast lung computed tomography (CT) scanning remains the most accessible and readily available diagnostic test in the clinical setting, and the well-known imaging finding of bilateral peripheral patchy ground-glass opacification/consolidation pattern is characteristic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. However, due to the vast and ambiguous clinical presentations of COVID-19, besides the lung CT, other imaging modalities should be drawn upon to elucidate the obscure COVID-19 presentations.\n\n【5】In this study, we describe several uncommon clinical presentations of COVID-19 and the use of imaging modalities in their diagnosis by explaining some atypical imaging findings in 5 patients in our referral hospitals. All 5 patients had a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, and other differential diagnoses were excluded by complementary exams.\n\n【6】Accordingly, the following is a description of 5 COVID-19 patients with uncommon manifestations of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, mesenteric ischemia, myocarditis, and encephalitis.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentations\n\n【8】##### 2.1. Case 1: Pneumomediastinum and Pneumothorax\n\n【9】A 35-year-old man with a negative past medical history was admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea, fever, and headaches of 6 days’ duration. He had received azithromycin and dexamethasone as the treatment of pneumonia in another canter, but his symptoms had gradually worsened. An initial examination in our center revealed an oxygen saturation level of 88% in the room air, tachycardia (120 beats per minute), tachypnea (23 breaths per minute), and low-grade fever (∼38.3°C). The most prominent finding in the physical examination was bilateral subcutaneous emphysema in the neck with diminished respiratory sounds. Laboratory results showed elevated levels of 37 mm/h for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (normal range = 0–10) and 93 mg/dL for C-reactive protein (CRP) (normal range = 0–10). A blood count showed leukocytosis with 17.1 × 109 cells/L. Clinical suspicion of COVID-19 prompted PCR testing, which was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient underwent a lung CT scan, which showed characteristic ground-glass opacities, suggestive of COVID-19 in the peripheral subpleural regions of both lungs. Moreover, extensive free air was detected in the pleural and mediastinal cavities, compatible with the diagnosis of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum . He was initially treated with oxygen supplementation with a reservoir mask; nonetheless, dyspnea exacerbation in addition to subcutaneous emphysema led to the intubation of the patient. A chest tube was inserted for the treatment of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. After 2 days, the patient was extubated and was given oxygen through a reservoir mask. His general condition improved during the admission. A CT scan on the eighth day of admission showed resolution of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum and notable improvement of lung lesions . The patient was discharged after 9 days of hospital stay with an oxygen saturation level of 93% in the room air, white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.9 × 109 cells/L, ESR of 10 mm/h, and CRP of less than 6 mg/dL.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Axial images (a–d) of pulmonary computed tomography in the parenchymal window from the thoracic inlet and upper chest depict extensive pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and soft tissue emphysema.

Case 2: Mesenteric Ischemia\n\n【13】A 54-year-old man with a 10-day history of worsening fever, coughs, and shortness of breath and without a remarkable past medical history was admitted. Initial examinations showed an oxygen saturation level of 84% in the room air, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and body temperature of 38.6°C. Laboratory evaluations showed leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.9 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L and elevated levels of ESR (91 mm/h) and CRP (27 mg/dL). With the clinical suspicion of COVID-19, the patient underwent a COVID-19 PCR test, which yielded a positive result. A lung CT scan demonstrated characteristic consolidations in the lower lobes of both the lungs with more severity on the left side, as well as ground-glass opacities in the subpleural areas.\n\n【14】A combination of intravenous fluid therapy and hydroxychloroquine was initiated for the patient according to the institutional protocols. He also received oxygen supplementation via a nasal cannula. His condition gradually improved within 3 days of admission with favorable changes in the laboratory results: a return of the WBC count to the normal level and a relative decrease in inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP). Given the improvement, the patient was discharged. Two days later, however, he came to the emergency department complaining of suddenly developed periumbilical abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A physical examination revealed abdominal distension and periumbilical tenderness. Electrocardiography was normal with sinus rhythm. An abdominal CT scan revealed nonmechanical bowel obstruction along with partial superior mesenteric artery thrombosis . The CT also showed that the origin of the superior mesenteric artery was normal, but it was occluded after the separation of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. Upon mesenteric ischemia diagnosis, laparotomy was conducted. Small intestinal necrosis and discoloration of necrotic tissues were evident. Resection was performed on the necrotic segment (270 cm long: starting at 120 cm from the Treitz ligament and ending at 35 cm from the ileocecal valve) of the bowel, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis. A second-look surgery did not reveal any significant abnormality. The patient stayed in the intensive care unit for 3 days after the operation before he was transferred to the general ward. He was discharged from the hospital 3 days later with an acceptable general condition and the resolution of the presenting symptoms.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Abdominopelvic CT scan with an intravenous contrast agent.

Case 3: Myocarditis\n\n【17】A 36-year-old woman without a noteworthy past medical history was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, fever, and tachycardia for the previous 5 days that had exacerbated. Vital signs on admission revealed an oxygen saturation level of 90% in the ambient air, tachycardia (126 beats per minute), a respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 38.4°C. A physical examination showed nothing remarkable except for diminished respiratory sounds in the bases of the lungs. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 PCR. A lung CT scan also confirmed the diagnosis with the visualization of peripheral ground-glass opacities, indicative of COVID-19. Laboratory results showed a normal count of WBC (9.17 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and elevated levels of ESR (32 mm/h) and CRP (21 mg/dL). Increased concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1170 U/L, normal range = 135–225), creatine phosphokinase (563 U/L, normal range = 39–308), and troponin T (2991 pg/mL, normal range = 0–14) suggested the probability of myocardial injury. She was placed under electrocardiographic monitoring, which showed normal sinus tachycardia without evidence of ischemia. An echocardiographic examination revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction = 25%). Subsequently, coronary CT angiography illustrated normal epicardial coronary arteries . A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed increased signal intensities in the myocardium in the short-tau inversion recovery sequence, consistent with myocardial edema. Furthermore, extensive subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement was detected . With the impression of COVID-19-related myocarditis, the treatment was started immediately with immunoglobulins, high-dose methylprednisolone, and remdesivir. By the sixth day of treatment, the cardiac function had improved notably on echocardiography (ejection fraction = 35%) and the oxygen saturation level had risen to 94%. The other vital signs were within normal ranges. The patient was discharged from the hospital 7 days after admission.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 a–c) Cardiac magnetic resonance images.

Case 4 and Case 5: Encephalitis\n\n【20】A 36-year-old woman with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus was brought to the emergency department. On admission, the patient had severe shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, and weakness. The initial vital signs were an oxygen saturation level of 75% in the room air, pulse rate of 98 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and body temperature of 38.5°C. Laboratory data showed an elevated blood glucose level of 490 mg/dL, ESR of 40 mm/h, CRP of 40 mg/dL, a WBC count of 21.1 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L, and a decreased blood pH level of 7.12. These findings were suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in a known case of diabetes mellitus. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, decreased oxygen saturation, and fever, the patient was tested for COVID-19 with nasopharyngeal swab PCR testing, which yielded a positive result. A lung CT scan also confirmed the presence of bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations in the posterior segment of the upper lobes and the right lower lobe. She was intubated because of the exacerbation of dyspnea and the development of seizure. For the assessment of the infection of the central nervous system, a lumbar puncture was conducted. It showed a clear colorless sample with 4 WBCs/mm<sup>3</sup> (normal range = 0–5), 80 RBCs/mm<sup>3</sup> (normal range = 0), a glucose level of 80 mg/dL (normal range = 40–70), a protein level of 72 mg/dL (normal range = 15–45), and opening pressure of 16 H<sub>2</sub>O (normal range = 5–20). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for Gram staining, herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, and the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test. This CSF analysis raised the clinical suspicion of COVID-19-associated encephalitis or venous thrombosis. For further evaluation, brain MRI/magnetic resonance venography (MRV) was conducted. The brain MRI revealed increased signal intensity and volume in the bilateral medial temporal structures and thalami on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence, with the increase being more prominent on the left side. Similar signal alterations were detected in the pons with the sparing of the corticospinal tracts . The brain MRV revealed no evidence of thrombosis in the dural venous sinuses. For the management of DKA, the patient received intravenous fluids and insulin for the reversal of the blood glucose level and the acidotic changes in arterial blood gases. The electrolytes were also controlled in the course of treatment. The patient came out of the DKA phase after 14 hours of treatment. For the treatment of COVID-19 and its associated encephalitis, she underwent therapy with methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulins, and azithromycin. Her symptoms and consciousness ameliorated during the treatment. Two days after admission, the patient was extubated. On day 6 after admission, she had an oxygen saturation level of 96% without supplemental oxygen and normal pulse and respiratory rates. A CT scan on day 6 showed a decrease in the severity of pulmonary involvement. She was discharged from the hospital on the sixth day, with the recommendation of a repeat brain MRI after 1 month. Laboratory data on discharge demonstrated 12 × 10<sup>9</sup> WBCs/L, ESR of 20 mm/h, and CRP of less than 6 mg/dL. The brain MRI in the following month showed no residual abnormalities or persistent lesions.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 (a–f) Consecutive axial fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequence images of brain MRI without contrast.

The patient was brought to the emergency department with the complaint of severe headaches, fatigue, dyspnea, and coughs. She had developed headaches and fatigue from 7 days earlier with gradual intensification. Two days before hospital admission, she developed dry coughs; on the day of admission, dyspnea. She had an oxygen saturation level of 90% in the room air, pulse rate of 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and body temperature of 37.8°C. Her SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was positive. Peripheral ground-glass opacities and diffuse consolidations with predominance in the lower lobes of both the lungs and lingula were detected. The severe headaches prompted an investigation for the involvement of the central nervous system. A lumbar puncture showed 2 WBCs/mm<sup>3</sup>, 150 RBCs/mm<sup>3</sup>, a protein level of 45 mg/dL, a glucose level of 60 mg/dL, negative Gram staining, no growth in bacterial culture, and negative results for all viral assays. The findings led to a diagnosis of possible COVID-19-associated encephalitis. Thereafter, a brain MRI showed increased FLAIR signal intensity in the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar white matter, with the increase being more prominent on the right side . The treatment of encephalitis was mainly supportive, utilizing supplemental oxygen with a nasal cannula, remdesivir as antiviral therapy, and intravenous fluids for hydration. The encephalitis course was self-limiting with the resolution of the symptoms within 7 days. The patient was headache-free on the seventh day of admission with normal consciousness. Her respiratory symptoms decreased notably in comparison with the presentation day, and her oxygen saturation level increased to 94% in the room air. She underwent a follow-up lung CT scan, which showed the disappearance of the majority of the initial abnormal lesions on day 8 of admission. The patient was discharged with a good general condition and mild fatigue.\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 (a, b) Two consecutive axial fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequence images of brain MRI without contrast from the posterior fossa.

Discussion and Conclusions\n\n【25】COVID-19 has become the major health issue of the century in that it has affected the whole world. Primarily, COVID-19 manifested itself with lower respiratory symptoms such as coughs and dyspnea; nevertheless, the global spread of COVID-19 begot uncommon presentations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We herein described 5 COVID-19 patients with rare and life-threatening complications, diagnosed with a timely application of imaging modalities. Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, mesenteric ischemia, myocarditis, and encephalitis are among the serious and uncommon complications of COVID-19, which should not be neglected and missed in COVID-19 patients with a rapid deterioration of clinical status.\n\n【26】Pneumothorax occurs in approximately 1% of all COVID-19 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. Although pneumothorax has been reported to be a consequence of barotrauma due to mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome, numerous studies have described the development of pneumothorax in patients on the nasal cannula or in ambient air 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Thus, spontaneous pneumothorax is now a well-documented rare complication of COVID-19, which chimes in with our presented cases. Pneumothorax might be a result of bilateral alveolar damage, leading to cystic changes. As the disease progresses, these cystic changes become more prone to rupture even in exposure to low pressures of nasal cannulae or coughs and other factors that increase transpulmonary pressures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In the radiologic survey of a patient with COVID-19, the formation of cystic changes and other contributing lesions to the development of pneumothorax must be assessed carefully. In addition to pneumothorax, there have also been reports of pneumomediastinum, which usually reflects more advanced lung involvement. In COVID-19 patients, pneumomediastinum is usually associated with more challenges in patient management and poorer outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Still, several case reports including ours have reported spontaneous resolution of this complication in patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>. Although the clinical behavior of pneumomediastinum is not clear in COVID-19 patients, radiologists must do their best for the early detection of findings related to the development of pneumomediastinum. A timely diagnosis of this condition determines the prognosis.\n\n【27】Thromboembolic events are a major group of complications in COVID-19. While deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism carry a higher prevalence, acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is an overwhelming condition that necessitates early detection and management; otherwise, it will lead to catastrophic outcomes of death or severe morbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The underlying mechanism of AMI in COVID-19 is not elucidated; however, several theories including hypercoagulable state due to inflammation, vascular thrombosis due to higher levels of von Willebrand factor in COVID-19 induced by endothelial damage, indirect intestinal damage by ACE2, and hemodynamic disturbances due to severe COVID-19 have been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15–17\\]</u>. Sudden occurrence of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, distension, or rapid deterioration of clinical status must prompt the clinical suspicion of AMI. Elevations in D-dimer and LDH levels may also be noted. On CT scans, dilation and edema in the bowel, intestinal wall thickening, pneumatosis intestinalis, and portal venous gas suggest the probability of AMI, which should be immediately explored with CT angiography as the gold standard for the detection of this devastating complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. Physicians must be alert about the signs and symptoms of AMI for the prevention of poor outcomes and higher survival of patients. Whenever there is a suspicion of AMI in COVID-19, workup and imaging must be instantly undertaken.\n\n【28】Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 have been reported in between 7% and 31% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Myocarditis is a perplexing condition, and it is associated with 7% of COVID-19-related deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Thus, the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 have a high clinical significance. Elevation of cardiac enzymes such as cardiac troponin I and NT-proBNP are the early clues for the investigation of myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>. While the endomyocardial biopsy is deemed the gold standard for the diagnosis of myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>, cardiac MRI is known as the gold-standard “imaging” modality for this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>. Different patterns of late gadolinium enhancement in COVID-19-associated myocarditis have been acknowledged in previous studies; nonetheless, it is mainly localized in the intramural or subepicardial regions of the left ventricle and the basal-to-mid inferolateral walls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 26\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Neurologic complications of COVID-19 comprise a large heterogeneous group of conditions. It is reported that 36% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients suffer from at least 1 neurologic complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Encephalitis is a known complication in many viral infections, and it causes major diagnostic challenges in COVID-19. A certain diagnosis of encephalitis is made through the isolation of the virus from the CSF. This process is usually not feasible in COVID-19 because of the transient dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and its very low titers in the CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Hence, brain MRI can be a useful tool in the diagnosis of COVID-19-associated encephalitis. Approximately half of COVID-19-encephalitis patients (51.5%) show no pathology in brain imaging. Of all the pathologies detected on brain MRI, diffuse hyperintensity of T2/FLAIR has been the most common, with its most prevalent location being in the white matter (24.2%), which is consistent with our findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. An earlier study suggested a 41% rate for normal brain imaging in encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Consequently, encephalitis in COVID-19 patients can be associated with nonspecific findings in brain MRI, electroencephalography, and the CSF analysis, rendering the role of physicians in ruling out the differential diagnoses and reaching the diagnosis of encephalitis critical. Several differential diagnoses can be suggested in the presence of seizure in COVID-19 patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, which is a probable and dangerous condition due to the hypercoagulable state caused by viral infection. In the process of establishing the diagnosis of encephalitis, an appropriate choice of imaging modalities is crucial to differentiating encephalitis from venous thrombosis and other entities.\n\n【30】Our study describes uncommon and serious complications of COVID-19 that, if missed, could lead to mortality. We showed that clinical suspicion and choice of the right imaging modality could change the treatment strategy of patients and save lives in the multisystem disorder, that is, COVID-19, with a wide range of complications such as pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, mesenteric ischemia, myocarditis, and encephalitis. Prompt diagnosis with appropriate imaging modalities can confer adequate treatment and improve survival.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Sister Mary Joseph’s nodule (SMJN) is a rare illness characterized by an umbilical mass caused by tumor metastases in the abdomen or pelvis. The most common main site of SMJN in women is ovarian cancer. Case Presentation. A 73-year-old woman with no pathological history came to our emergency room with a one-month history of umbilicus enlargement. A 9-centimeter uncomfortable umbilical swelling with hard consistency was discovered during a clinical examination. An ovarian tumor with several local expansions was seen on an abdominal CT scan. It was linked to peritoneal metastases, one of which extends via a supraumbilical hernial orifice and into intestinal tissues in the same hernia sac. The umbilical tumor was removed from the patient. A moderately differentiated serous carcinoma with ovarian origin was identified in a periumbilical site on histological testing. Conclusion. The presence of an SMJN is a rare but significant issue that clinicians must examine because it is associated with a bad prognosis. Early detection and diagnosis of the original lesion can lead to more effective treatment and a higher rate of survival.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Sister Mary Joseph’s nodule (SMJN) is a rare disorder characterized by an umbilical mass caused by tumor metastases in the abdomen and/or pelvis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. According to epidemiological research, this condition is more common in women, accounting for 1 to 3% of all intra-abdominal and pelvic malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The most common main site of SMJN in women is ovarian cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. SMJN might take the form of a soft, harmless nodule or a firm, painful mass. Its size ranges from 1 to 10 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The presence of the SMJN is linked to a poor prognosis, with overall survival ranging from 2 to 11 months from the time of diagnosis and a 5-year survival rate ranging from 5 to 15% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The purpose of this case is to discuss a case of Sister Mary Joseph’s nodule as a misdiagnosed ovarian cancer metastasis.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Presentation of the Case\n\n【7】A 73-year-old woman appeared with a firm umbilical mass that had been increasing for a month and had no history of an umbilical hernia. The patient was initially unconcerned about the lump because it was painless. The umbilical tumor had become uncomfortable two days before the presentation, causing the patient to seek medical help. She does not have any medical history.\n\n【8】A healthy-looking woman was discovered during the physical test. An inflammatory and uncomfortable umbilical mass of 9 cm with hard firmness was discovered during the abdominal exam . It also revealed a 10-centimeter left inguinal adenopathy that was painless, noninflammatory, and firm to the touch. The rest of the medical examination went smoothly.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 A 9-centimeter inflammatory and painful umbilical tumor with a hard consistency.</u>\n\n【10】A 12 cm suspicious tumor in the left ovary was discovered by pelvic transvaginal ultrasonography.\n\n【11】We opted to finish with a pelvic scanner because of the importance of the pelvic mass, which exceeds the limits of ultrasound.\n\n【12】The patient received an abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed a 12 × 11 cm left ovarian tumor with several local expansions. It was linked to intraperitoneal metastases, one of which is 9 × 8 cm in size and extends through a supraumbilical orifice with digestive processes in the same hernial sac .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 An ovarian tumor with intraperitoneal metastases, one of which extends through a hernial supraumbilical orifice, is shown on a CT scan of the abdominal cavity and pelvis.</u>\n\n【14】The results of the biochemical tests revealed a normal total blood count and electrolytes as well as a high CA-125 level (200 UI/ml).\n\n【15】The patient was admitted to the hospital, and the diagnostic and treatment options were addressed with the patient and a multidisciplinary team. We first performed a resection of the umbilical mass with omentum reintroduction into the abdominal cavity and the removal of any remnant malignancies.\n\n【16】The resection margins were devoid of tumor, and histological evaluation revealed a periumbilical site of a moderately differentiated serous carcinoma compatible with ovarian origin .\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 The umbilical nodule’s microscopic features reveal a carcinomatous growth of glands and papillae lined by cuboidal cells with severe nuclear atypia (HEX 100).</u>\n\n【18】We made the decision to perform an exploratory laparotomy. During surgery, a solid mass measuring 12 cm was discovered on the left ovary, along with a tiny amount of ascites. There were also intra-abdominal and omentum metastatic lesions found. Total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and omentectomy were the procedures performed.\n\n【19】Histopathology revealed an ovarian serous carcinoma, which was also found in the umbilical tumor. The lymph nodes in the inguinal and iliac arteries were positive, and the omentum had metastatic disease. As a result, the definitive diagnosis was ovarian cancer stage IV B 删除1:<u>(FIGO ovarian cancer staging)</u>.\n\n【20】The recovery went smoothly, and the patient was discharged a week following surgery. Chemotherapy with carboplatin (starting dosage AUC 5–6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was started one month after hospital discharge and continued every three weeks for six cycles.\n\n【21】Currently, the patient has completed 12 months of treatment and gets clinical examinations and tumor markers every three months. There was no clinical recurrence, and CA-125 levels gradually declined and returned to normal after two years.\n\n【22】#### 3\\. Clinical Discussion\n\n【23】SMJN was named after Sister Mary Joseph Dempsey, who worked as a surgical assistant for Dr. William James Mayo. She was the first to link a metastatic umbilical nodule to abdominopelvic cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It was first mentioned in print in 1864 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【24】SMJN is a rare condition caused by a primary neoplasm. The gastrointestinal tract (35 to 65%) and the genitourinary tract (12 to 35%) were the most common sites of primary neoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The main location may not be detected in roughly 30% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The ovaries (14 to 41%), endometrial (1 to 10%), and pancreatobiliary tree (12%) were the most commonly described main sites in women in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【26】SMJN’s mechanism is unknown, but some theories have been offered, such as a direct expansion of the tumor, lymphatic dissemination, or hematogenous spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【27】An SMJN can take many forms, ranging from a soft, harmless nodule to an uneven, painful mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【28】An umbilical mass, in fact, can be the earliest indicator of an intra-abdominal or pelvic tumor with peritoneal metastases, and it is easy to miss during a physical exam. As a result, early detection and appropriate treatment are critical.\n\n【29】In the presence of an umbilical mass, other diagnoses such as umbilicitis, umbilical abcess, umbilical hernia, umbilical endometriosis, omphalith, keloid, pyoderma gangrenosum, or foreign body can be made.\n\n【30】To confirm the diagnosis of SMJN, a biopsy and histological testing are required. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type in about 75% of SMJN cases with intra-abdominal malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【31】An ovarian cancer with intraperitoneal metastases, one of which extends via a hernial supraumbilical orifice, was the final pathological diagnosis in our case.\n\n【32】Although the therapeutic strategy has not yet been standardized, it must be multidisciplinary. Treatment for ovarian cancer is mainly palliative care; however, occasional cases of aggressive treatment with surgery and chemotherapy have been recorded with higher long-term survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【33】The primary surgical treatment in our case was the removal of the umbilical tumor with the reintroduction of the omentum into the abdominal cavity. It is possible that adjuvant chemotherapy will be required.\n\n【34】Umbilical metastasis is usually associated with a dismal prognosis, with just 15% of patients surviving for two years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【35】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【36】An SMJN is a rare yet significant illness that is frequently misdiagnosed.\n\n【37】Early detection and diagnosis of the original lesion can lead to more effective treatment and a higher rate of survival.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Not only are the symptoms of the first presentation but also the ages of presentation are very variable. Following three case reports, different causes of possible late presentation are discussed. Many factors are responsible for the age at which sickle cell disease is diagnosed: doctor’s delay (unfamiliarity with the disease), patient’s delay (education and financial position of the parents, cultural factors), high- versus low-resource country (availability of newborn screening), fetal hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and genetic modulators, such as SCD genotype, alpha-thalassemia, fetal hemoglobin concentration, and G6PD deficiency. The individual course of sickle cell disease depends on (epi) genetic and environmental properties and the underlying interactions. In further studies, the role of each factor should be evaluated more deeply, and its use as a marker of disease severity or activity should be assessed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common group of life-threatening, genetic disorders caused by the synthesis of abnormal hemoglobin (sickle hemoglobin), which when deoxygenated, polymerizes and causes sickling of red blood cells. SCD is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, vasoocclusion, and progressive vascular injury causing multiorgan damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The clinic of SCD is quite variable and reflects the interactions with other genetic and environmental factors and can include painful vasoocclusive crises (VOCs), acute chest syndrome, cerebral stroke, and acute and chronic hemolysis. Due to functional hyposplenism, there is susceptibility to invasive bacterial infection with encapsulated bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, India, and the Mediterranean area, SCD is the most prevalent, where more than 90% of the annual SCD births take place, but due to migration, SCD can be diagnosed also in other parts of the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. While newborn screening and follow-up with prophylactic interventions are common in high-resource countries, most children die before the age of 5 years, often before a diagnosis was made, in low-resource countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Sickle cell anemia (SCA) refers solely to patients homozygous for the sickle mutation (HbSS) and is together with sickle β°-thalassemia responsible for more severe diseases in the group of SCD. Hemoglobin SC disease and sickle β⁺-thalassemia are common and in general, less severe presentations of SCD. Hemoglobin SD and hemoglobin SE are much less common.\n\n【6】The individual course of SCD is heterogeneous and depends not only on several genetic factors, such as the concomitant presence of alpha-thalassemia, sickle β\\-haplotypes, fetal hemoglobin levels, and G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency, but also on environmental properties and their underlying interactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There can be a widespread diversity in clinic and first presentation between different communities, but sometimes also in the same family 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. A late first presentation is not always so straightforward, and patient and doctor’s delay is not uncommon as we will show in two cases.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentations\n\n【8】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【9】A twenty-month-old boy with no relevant medical history presented at the outpatient clinic with limping for 7 days (D7 = day 7 of disease) without a prior trauma. Fever up to 38.5 degrees Celsius was noted over the last week. The boy was born at term by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery following a normal pregnancy; his weight at birth was 3.6 kilograms. He was the first child of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents from Angola. The family history did not reveal any relevant information except that the mother is a carrier of sickle cell anemia (HbAS), which was denied to the father. Physical examination showed a mild sick, male with normal cardiovascular and respiratory parameters, with 38.5 degrees Celsius. The skin was pale, without signs of jaundice. There were no signs of dehydration. ENT examination showed mild rhinorrhea with some pharyngeal redness. Heart and lung auscultation was normal. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Neurological examination was normal. We saw mild limping of the right leg with mildly painful abduction right hip. The initial complete blood count showed a mild, microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL (normal 10.5–13.6 g/dL), MCV 68 (normal 70–85 fL), reticulocytes 60/1000 RBC (normal 11–29/1000 RBC), leukocytes of 12.3 × 10E9/L (normal 6.0–17.0 × 10E9/L) with normal differentiation, and thrombocytes of 559 × 10E9/L (normal 304–574 × 10E9/L). Blood smear revealed poikilocytosis, tear cells, schistocytes, and some target cells. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated up to 144 mg/L (normal ≤ 5 mg/L). An ultrasound of the ankles, knees, and hips did not show any abnormalities. Under suspicion of reactive arthritis, the patient was sent home with bedrest, pain medication, and follow-up appointment.\n\n【10】At D13, he was again seen in the outpatient clinic; his temperature normalized over the last few days, while his physical examination did not reveal changes. The ultrasound of the hip was normal. A radiograph of the pelvis showed irregularities of the right iliac wing. Bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-MDP revealed an elevated distribution at the right pelvic wing anterolaterally, possible of an inflammatory nature. Because CRP spontaneously improved (23.9 mg/L (normal ≤ 5 mg/L)) and of the absence of fever, an MRI of the pelvis was requested as an outpatient.\n\n【11】At D19, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) revealed an increased signal of the right iliac wing on the STIR 通用删除1(英):<u>(short-TI inversion recovery)</u> images. The adjacent soft tissue captures the contrast. The image suggests osteomyelitis. The patient was admitted. CRP normalized to 3 mg/l. His temperature was normal. After blood cultures were drawn, IV (intravenously) antibiotics, cefotaxime and flucloxacillin, were started. Blood culture did not reveal any growth. Because of an atypical course, more extensive research into possible explanation has been carried out, including cultures for Salmonella typhi and Kingella kingae, the tuberculin skin test, and serology for HIV. They were all negative. Before a biopsy of the bone lesion was performed, hemoglobin electrophoresis confirmed sickle cell anemia (HbA2 2.3%, HbF 24.5%, and HbS 73.2%). Due to the absence of clear sickle cells in the blood smear, denial of carrier status (HbAS) of the father, late recognition that the limping is pain due to VOC, and the presence of a high HbF, the diagnose of sickle cell anemia was delayed.\n\n【12】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【13】A three-year-old boy was followed by a pediatric rheumatologist on suspicion of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis due to varying pains in his hands and feet for 18 months. Sporadically, the child refused to walk. Often, these episodes were preceded by fever and eased with ibuprofen. No rash was reported. He presented in the clinic of the pediatric rheumatologist with fever (39 degrees Celsius) for 1-2 weeks with limping and painful swelling of the right tibia above the ankle. He was initially seen by the pediatric rheumatologist who made the diagnosis of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and treatment with ibuprofen and corticosteroids was started. The body temperature normalized, but pain and swelling of the tibia remained, after which the child was admitted.\n\n【14】The boy was born at term by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery following a normal pregnancy; his weight at birth was 3 kilograms. He was the first child of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents from Guinea. The family history did not reveal any relevant information.\n\n【15】Physical examination at the first presentation showed a moderate sick male with normal cardiovascular and respiratory parameters, with a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius. The skin was pale. No signs of dehydration. No signs of upper respiratory tract infection. Heart and lung auscultation were normal.\n\n【16】The abdomen was showing mild hepatomegaly (3-4 cm under the costal arch), and the spleen was not palpable. Extremities: at the right tibia, warm, painful swelling several centimeters proximal of the distal metaphysis. The left tibia was painful on palpation, but no other clinical signs.\n\n【17】The initial complete blood count showed a severe, normocytic anemia with hemoglobin of 6.4 g/dL (normal 11.5–13.5 g/dL), reticulocytes 77/1000 RBC (normal 8–20/1000 RBC), leukocytes of 15.3 × 10E9/L (normal 5.5–15.5 × 10E9/L) with normal differentiation, and thrombocytes of 448 × 10E9/L (normal 228–433 × 10E9/L). Blood smear revealed hypochromasia, target cells, poikilocytosis, and sickle cells. There were no signs of hemolysis with normal lactate dehydrogenase (707 U/L (normal 425–975 U/L)) and total bilirubin (0.7 mg/dL (normal 0.2–1.3)). C-reactive protein was 56 mg/L (normal ≤ 5 mg/L).\n\n【18】After admission to the pediatric department, within hours, his clinical condition worsened with prolonged capillary refill with tachycardia (192/minute) but normal blood pressure. After blood cultures were drawn, IV ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg) was started together with IV fluid resuscitation (NaCl 0.9%, 20 mL/kg) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. X-ray of the right tibia showed significant soft tissue swelling from the distal lower leg and at the distal metaphysis, a slight clearance with possible cortex interruption. Bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-MDP reveals a bone injury at the right distal tibia with a hyperemic component, compatible with an abscess. Surgical drainage showed a lot of pus with a culture showing growth of Salmonella typhimurium. Antibiotic treatment was switched to high dose amoxicillin according to the sensitivity. Blood and stool cultures remained negative. Hemoglobin electrophoresis confirmed the diagnosis of sickle cell disease (HbA2 2.7%, HbF 24.1%, and HbS 73%). The initial wrong diagnosis (doctor’s delays) by not recognizing sickle cell disease despite high risk based on ethnicity and VOC and the high HbF were responsible for the late diagnosis.\n\n【19】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【20】A three-year-old girl without a relevant medical history was admitted to the hospital under the suspicion of pneumonia. She was born at term by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery following a normal pregnancy; her weight at birth was 3.2 kilogram. She was the second child of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents from Mali. The family history did not reveal any relevant information. Physical examination showed a sick female with mild tachycardia (pulse 134/minute) and moderate dyspnea (34/minute), with 39.1 degrees Celsius. The skin was pale, no signs of jaundice, and no signs of dehydration. ENT examination showed the presence of mild rhinorrhea with some pharyngeal redness. Systolic murmur 1/6 was over the heart and diminished air-entry over the right lower lobe. The abdomen was not showing hepatosplenomegaly. The initial complete blood count showed a mild, microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL (normal 10.5–13.6 g/dL), reticulocytes of 30/1000 RBC (normal 11–29/1000 RBC), leukocytes of 10.3 × 10E9/L (normal 6.0–17.0 × 10E9/L) with normal differentiation, and thrombocytes of 316 × 10E9/L (normal 229–435 × 10E9/L). Blood smear revealed poikilocytosis, polychromasia, and target cells. C-reactive protein (CRP) was only mildly elevated up to 30 mg/L (normal ≤ 5 mg/L). X-thorax showed a consolidation in the region of the right lower lobe. Under suspicion of pneumonia, intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was initiated. Despite the ethnicity and the clinic of an acute chest syndrome, only in the context of the anemia, a hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed, revealing the presence of hemoglobin C (42%) and hemoglobin S (46%). Family research showed that the parents are carriers (mother HbC 32% and father HbS 42%), and their first-born male has the same condition as his sister, namely, hemoglobin SC disease. After discharge, antibiotic prophylaxis and folic acid were initiated.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】The patients presented in this case series are born in Belgium. They are of sub-Saharan African immigrant families and demonstrate a high frequency of SCD mutations. In their native countries, newborn screening and comprehensive healthcare only rarely takes place at an early age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, therefore, resulting in a wide variation of the age at diagnosis of SCD. The medium age reported varies from 2 until 6 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–12\\]</u>. Sarat et al. report that in Brazil, the medium age at diagnosis of the adults receiving care for HbSS was five years and for HSC, 21 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Even in high-resource countries such as Belgium, universal newborn screening and prenatal counseling are not always performed. According to the German SCD registry, most children were discovered after the age of one year, usually by presenting with symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. The median age at diagnosis of a cohort of children with SCD in the Netherlands was 25 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Often due to the lack of knowledge of the physicians regarding SCD, even symptoms, typically associated with clinical manifestations of SCD, are misinterpreted, resulting in inadequate treatment. It is important to address these important public health issues.\n\n【23】There can be several other factors also responsible for the manner and the time at which the disease presents itself, some of which will be discussed .\n\n【24】Table 1 Factors influencing the age of presentation of SCD in children.\n\n【25】##### 3.1. Western World versus Developing Countries\n\n【26】Although patients with SCA have an identical monogenic condition, its clinical phenotypes are highly variable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. Different pathways play a role in the pathophysiology, and different genes have been under evolutionary pressure. It is fair to assume that ethnic differences influence the course of SCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The vast majority and burden of disease is in sub-Saharan Africa. Because of economic limitations, newborn screening of hemoglobin disorders is not achieved. Diagnosis is mostly delayed until children have clinical signs. Screening because of a positive family history is possible yet less applied because of financial considerations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Also, not infrequently, the belief in evil spirits may be one obstacle for seeking timely medical care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【27】In sub-Saharan countries, without intervention, 50–90% of children with SCD will die in childhood, mostly due to infection/sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 21\\]</u>, often before the diagnosis of SCD is made. There is no increased mortality in children with severe malaria when they also have sickle cell anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Worldwide, we also have a genetic explanation for different ways of presentation, as we know there are different haplotypes in different regions of the world. For example, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, there are two major clinical phenotypes. Patients from the Western Province have a severe course consistent with the Benin haplotype. They are prone to recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, and dactylitis and in general have a lower level of hemoglobin and hemoglobin F (HbF). They typically present early with painful crises. Patients from the Eastern Province have a milder course of disease; they act more like the Arab and Indian phenotypes. This is associated with higher levels of HbF and frequently a later date of the first presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>.\n\n【29】##### 3.2. Fetal Hemoglobin\n\n【30】HbF is a physiologic protein tetramer that is of major importance during fetal life. Its affinity for oxygen is higher than the mother’s hemoglobin and thereby facilitates the transfer of oxygen from maternal to fetal blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. A higher HbF level in the postnatal period is known to have a positive effect on the course of SCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 25–27\\]</u>. Patients with SCD and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) have a significantly milder phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> with a longer lifespan of the red blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. HbF prevents polymerization of HbS by reducing the concentration of HbS. The sufficient amount of HbF to prevent the clinical manifestations of SCD in vivo is not completely clarified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>, while in vitro studies suggest that 20% HbF is necessary to prevent polymerization of HbS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. In a cross-sectional single center study in Nigeria, it was found that stroke was related to lower levels of HbF; while on the other hand, complications such as priapism, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis or ulcers were not linked to lower levels of HbF. In this study, lower levels were mostly found in boys, which were not seen in adults. Possibly, a hormonal role during puberty is responsible. In addition, there is a relationship between the percentage of HbF and age, in which the percentage of HbF decreases with age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【31】A different explanation might be the haplotype of the disease. Senegal, Saudi, and Indian haplotypes are generally associated with higher levels of HbF and therefore known for a milder course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24–26\\]</u>. HbF is also increased in different inherited conditions, such as HPFH, hereditary spherocytosis, and thalassemia. Family studies suggest an inheritance that does not follow the Mendelian pattern. HbF levels are multifactorial, influenced with 89% of variability because of genetic factors, and the other is dependent on sex, age, and environmental factors. The level of HbF rises in several acquired states, such as pregnancy, aplastic anemia, thyrotoxicosis, hepatoma, myeloproliferative disorders, or hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【32】##### 3.3. Reticulocytes\n\n【33】The role of the reticulocyte in the pathophysiology of SCD is not fully understood and still understudied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The reticulocyte count is commonly used as a marker of the bone marrow’s response to hemolysis and anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 27\\]</u>. Under normal conditions, each second, the bone marrow produces about 2 million reticulocytes. In SCD, this can increase up to 20-fold due to hemolytic anemia. During this increased production, the bone marrow releases reticulocytes prematurely in the blood in order to meet the demands. As SCD is accompanied by chronic hemolysis, there is a continuous stress erythropoiesis and therefore a persistent reticulocytosis. These prematurely released reticulocytes are less rigid than the sickle cell, but they contribute to vasoocclusion due to their big size and membrane properties promoting adhesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The splenic dysfunction in SCD is responsible for the lack of removal of the reticulocytes, leading to an overrepresentation (up to 25%) of the reticulocytes of all circulating red blood cells. The benefit of these cells might not transcend the pathological consequences. Data and studies are lacking to identify a thorough link between reticulocytosis and disease severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【34】In infancy, in children with SCD, the physiologic anemia will show an exaggerated increase in the reticulocyte count and could be a marker for SCD. In the cooperative study of sickle cell disease, the absolute reticulocyte count above 200 000/µl in the age group 2–6 months was associated with a three-time risk for SCD-related events which needed hospitalization within the first three years of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 29, 30\\]</u>. Ambrose et al. showed in a prospective cohort study conducted in Tanzania that children with SCA and sickle β°-thalassemia had a lower Hb with a high red cell distribution width (RDW) at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, compared to carriers of sickle cell disease and sickle β<sup>+</sup>\\-thalassemia. The results of a simple blood test could suspect the presence of SCD already in this age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【35】##### 3.4. Genetic Modulators\n\n【36】Some genetic modulators of SCD severity are well known as concurrent α\\-thalassemia, fetal hemoglobin concentration, and ß\\-globin haplotype. Possible G6PD deficiency can have an impact on SCD. More recently, BCL11 A and HBS1L-MYP were added to the list 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【37】##### 3.5. SCD Genotype\n\n【38】While sickle cell anemia (HbSS) and sickle β<sup>0</sup>\\-thalassemia (HbS-β<sup>0</sup>) are responsible for more severe diseases; hemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) and sickle β⁺-thalassemia (HbS-β⁺) are common and in general, less severe presentations of SCD. HbSC is the most common type in the African American population in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. HbC does not polymerize, but it potentiates the polymerization of HbS by increasing the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. As the course is rather mild, the patients still can suffer from the classic vasoocclusive complications as priapism, splenic sequestration, and acute chest syndrome. HbSC patients rarely present with a stroke as they have higher hemoglobin levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>, but presumable, due to the higher blood viscosity, retinopathy is seen more often 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. HbS-β⁺ is milder with less severe pain crises and less severe splenic dysfunction. Therefore, the disease can present itself later in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. On the other hand, this genotype has a broad spectrum of phenotypes, and therefore, caution should be taken 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【39】##### 3.6. Alpha-Thalassemia\n\n【40】The decrease in α\\-globin chains in SCD reduces the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and, thereby, the polymerization within the RBC. Homozygous alpha-thalassemia decreases the oxidative stress in SCA and could be an explanation for the protected role of alpha-thalassemia from various hemolysis-related complications of SCA. In contrast, the rate of vasoocclusive events is not related to their oxidative stress level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. In 2014, Cox et al. reported in a study of 601 stroke-free Tanzanian SCA patients aged <24 years, the importance of alpha-thalassemia of reducing risk of abnormal cerebral blood flow velocity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Olatunya et al. performed a cross-sectional retrospective study on 100 young Nigerian patients with SCA and 63 controls. Their study confirms that coexistence of alpha-thalassemia with SCA significantly influences both the clinical and laboratory manifestations with increased bone pain crisis and protection against leg ulcers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.\n\n【41】##### 3.7. Fetal Hemoglobin Concentration\n\n【42】The Xmn1 polymorphism on chromosome 11p is the first genetic variant associated with increased levels of HbF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>, but it is assumed that additional factors are also necessary to have a clinical impact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Another gene linked to higher HbF levels is BCL11 A on chromosome 2p16. This is a transcriptional repressor of the γ\\-globin in helping control the developmental switch from embryonic to adult ß\\-globin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Variations in the BCL11 A binding site are found concurrent with HPFH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. The MYB transcription factor of the c\\-Myb gene on chromosome 6q23 is an important regulator of hematopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and HbF levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 38\\]</u>. Low MYB levels stimulate the erythroid differentiation, causing the release of larger cells expressing predominantly γ\\-globin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Using whole genome sequencing of many SCD genomes, many other HbF regulators will be identified. With all the acquired new data, it will be difficult to define and harmonize the variable phenotypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【43】##### 3.8. G6PD\n\n【44】There are conflicting data on the impact of concurrent G6PD deficiency on laboratory and clinical parameters of SCD. Belisario et al. investigated a cohort of 395 Brazilian children with SCA and demonstrated that G6PD molecular deficiency or enzyme activity was not associated either with clinical ischemic stroke or high-risk transcranial Doppler 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>, while Joly et al. studied 121 children with SCA and concluded that G6PD deficiency and absence of a\\-thalassemia increases the risk for cerebral vasculopathy in children with sickle cell anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. Antwi-Baffour et al. examined the blood of 120 SCD patients of genotypes HbSS and HbSC and found statistically significant differences between the Hb concentration of the participants having a G6PD deficiency (males) and those with normal G6PD activity (females), concluding that G6PD deficiency may increase the severity of anemia in SCD patients and therefore a possible earlier presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.\n\n【45】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【46】SCD is a well-studied but not completely understood entity. When no newborn screening has taken place, a child’s sickle cell disease can present for the first time in different ways and at different ages. Many factors are responsible for this. Familiarity and knowledge of SCD are of course essential with a low threshold for additional research (peripheral blood smear and Hb electrophoresis) to prevent delay of the diagnosis and performance of unnecessary tests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Although it is generally considered safe, common adverse drug reactions of ibuprofen include stomach pain, nausea, and heartburn. It can also cause gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially in individuals with a history of GI ulcers or bleeding disorders. Ibuprofen is predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C8. Individuals carrying the CYP2C9∗3 or CYP2C8∗3 non-functional alleles have reduced enzyme activities resulting in elevated ibuprofen plasma concentrations and half-life. We presented a case of a 31-year-old Saudi female patient with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had taken ibuprofen at 600 mg twice daily for eight weeks. The patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and black tarry stools. An emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on the patient, which revealed a deep bleeding ulcer measuring 1 × 1 cm in the antrum of the stomach. Laboratory investigations indicated anemia (hemoglobin: 7.21 g/dL and hematocrit: 22.40 g/dl). The patient received intravenous proton pump inhibitors and a packed red blood cell transfusion. Genetic analysis revealed that the patient was a carrier of CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles, indicating that the patient is a poor metabolizer for both enzymes. The patient’s symptoms improved over the subsequent days, and she was discharged with instructions to avoid NSAIDs. This is the first reported Saudi patient homozygous for CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles, which led to ibuprofen-induced upper GI toxicity. This case demonstrates the importance of contemplating CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 genetic variations when administrating NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Careful assessment of the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy in each patient and consideration of alternative pain management strategies must be conducted when appropriate.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) commonly used to alleviate moderate pain and fever and to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Ibuprofen is a cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 inhibitor, catalyzing prostaglandin synthesis. The inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 may account for ibuprofen’s antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Ibuprofen is available over the counter in most countries and is generally considered safe. However, like other NSAIDs, ibuprofen can cause potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which include nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, diarrhea, and headache 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>. Ibuprofen can also cause serious complications, including GI bleeding and ulcers (1-2%), hypertension (up to 5%), myocardial infarction (up to 1% per year), and heart failure (up to 1%), and renal damage and sudden cardiac death have also been observed in rare cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Ibuprofen is predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 to form the inactive metabolites hydroxyibuprofen and carboxyibuprofen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. These metabolites are then eliminated from the body through the urine. The rate of metabolism and elimination of ibuprofen can vary depending on factors such as age, liver function, genetic variations in CYP enzymes, and concurrent use of other medications that affect CYP activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 genes can alter these enzymes’ activity and the ibuprofen’s metabolism, leading to variations in drug efficacy and ADRs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. The most studied CYP2C9 polymorphisms are CYP2C9∗2 (rs1799853) and CYP2C9∗3 (rs1057910). Individuals carrying the CYP2C9∗2 and CYP2C9∗3 variant alleles have decreased enzymatic activities, approximately 5% and 12%, respectively, compared to individuals with the CYP2C9∗1 wild-type allele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. As a result, individuals carrying these variant alleles may have slower metabolism of ibuprofen, leading to higher drug concentrations and a longer duration of action 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. Studies have shown that individuals carrying the CYP2C9∗2 and CYP2C9∗3 variant alleles are at higher risk of developing ADRs and toxicities to ibuprofen, such as GI bleeding or kidney damage, compared to individuals carrying the wild-type CYP2C9∗1 allele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. Furthermore, individuals who carry the CYP2C8∗3 (rs10509681) allele have reduced enzymatic activity relative to the wild-type CYP2C8∗1 allele. The CYP2C8∗3 allele has been linked to diminished ibuprofen metabolism and clearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【6】This paper presents a unique case involving a Saudi patient homozygous for both CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles, which led to ibuprofen-induced upper GI toxicity. This is the first documented case reporting a combination of genetic variants and their association with ADRs following ibuprofen administration.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】We report a case of a 31-year-old Saudi female patient diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for one year. As part of her RA management, the patient has been prescribed a weekly oral dose of methotrexate at 7.5 mg and a daily folic acid supplementation of 1 mg/day for 12 months. Additionally, for the past eight weeks, the patient has been self-medicating with ibuprofen at 600 mg twice daily to alleviate acute pain associated with RA. The patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and black tarry stools. Notably, the patient reported that these symptoms started on the day she sought emergency services. The patient did not report any preexisting medical conditions, including GI disorders or ulcers. Furthermore, the patient had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption and exhibited a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n【9】On physical examination, the patient exhibited signs of hemodynamic instability. In the supine position, the patient’s blood pressure was measured at 90/30 mmHg, indicating hypotension. Additionally, the patient displayed tachycardia, with a heart rate of 130 beats per minute. The abdominal examination demonstrated epigastric tenderness along with abdominal guarding and rigidity. Laboratory investigations showed anemia (hemoglobin: 7.21 g/dL (normal: 14–18 g/dl) and hematocrit: 22.40 g/dl (normal: 14–18 g/dl)) and mild leukocytosis (white blood cells (WBC): 13700/mm<sup>3</sup> (normal: 4–11 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>)). Liver functions, blood sugar, urea, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters were all within normal ranges.\n\n【10】An emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed on the patient, which revealed a deep ulcer measuring 1 × 1 cm in the antrum of the stomach. The ulcer was characterized by the presence of a visible vessel, consistent with a Forrest Ib classification, indicating active bleeding. Additionally, according to the Sakita classification, the ulcer was classified as Sakita Type II, representing a deep ulcer with a visible vessel or clot. Notably, the EGD examination did not reveal any additional abnormal endoscopic findings throughout the esophagus, duodenum, or other regions of the upper GI tract. Importantly, gastric biopsies obtained from both the antrum and body regions yielded negative results for Helicobacter pylori infection. The patient was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer and was promptly administered an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) alongside a transfusion of packed red blood cells to correct the accompanying anemia. The patient was hospitalized to closely monitor for any indications of recurrent bleeding.\n\n【11】Analysis of genetic variations in CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3, which play a significant role in the metabolism of ibuprofen, was performed. The patient’s DNA was collected from saliva samples using an Oragene DNA saliva collection kit (OG-500, Genotek, Canada), and genotyping of CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 alleles was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) following previously described protocols 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. In brief, CYP2C9∗3 was detected using the forward and reverse PCR primers 5′-TGC​ACG​AGG​TCC​AGA​GAT​GC-3′ and 5′-GAT​ACT​ATG​AAT​TTG​GGG​ACT​TC-3′ (Macrogen, Korea), respectively. The amplified PCR products were digested with 5 U restriction enzymes Mph1103I (NsiI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) overnight at 37°C. The detection for CYP2C9∗3 was performed using the forward and reverse primers 5′-CTT​CCG​TGC​TAC​ATG​ATG​ACG-3′ and 5′-CTG​CTG​AGA​AAG​GCA​TGA​AG-3′ (Macrogen, Korea), respectively. The amplified PCR products were digested with 5 U restriction enzymes PdmI (XmnI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) by overnight incubation at 55°C. The digested PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under ultraviolet light. The representative agarose gel images of CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗2 PCR-RFLP assays were used to interpret the patient’s genotypes . The CYP2C9∗3 allele produced 50 bp and 118 bp after digestion with Mph1103I (NsiI) 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>, while the CYP2C8∗3 allele produced as a single band at 117 bp that is not cut following the digestion with PdmI (XmnI) 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. The genotyping results revealed that the patient was homozygous for the CYP2C9∗3 non-functional allele (CYP2C9∗3/∗3) and CYP2C8∗3 non-functional allele (CYP2C8∗3/∗3). According to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), the patient is a CYP2C9 poor metabolizer (homozygous CYP2C9∗3) and CYP2C8 poor metabolizer (homozygous CYP2C8∗3). Poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 enzymes exhibit reduced metabolic activity, resulting in a diminished ability to metabolize ibuprofen. Consequently, these individuals experience slower clearance of the drug from their bodies. These genetic variations may have contributed to the patient’s increased risk of GI ulcers while taking ibuprofen.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) results of CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 polymorphisms.

A repeat EGD was performed, revealing promising signs of ulcer healing. Consequently, the revised Forrest classification for the ulcer was determined to be III, indicating a healing ulcer. Correspondingly, the Sakita classification for the patient was categorized as Sakita Type III, providing further affirmation of the ongoing healing process of the ulcer. During the patient’s hospitalization, a transition was made from intravenous to oral PPI therapy. After two days without any signs of rebleeding and with the patient’s vital signs returning to normal, she was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【14】The patient’s discharge plan involved maintaining the ongoing oral PPI treatment while discontinuing ibuprofen. Additionally, the patient received instructions to refrain from using NSAIDs and to schedule a follow-up appointment with her rheumatologist for further management of her RA.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Ibuprofen is widely used to alleviate pain, inflammation, and fever. Although it is generally considered safe, prolonged or excessive use of ibuprofen can lead to various ADRs. Common ADRs of ibuprofen include stomach pain, nausea, and heartburn. It can also cause GI ulcers, especially in individuals with a history of GI ulcers or bleeding disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 22\\]</u>. Specific polymorphisms in the genes encoding the CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 enzymes can lead to reduced enzyme activity and slower clearance of ibuprofen from the body, increasing the risk of ibuprofen-related ADR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. This is the first report addressing the association between combined CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles with ibuprofen-induced upper GI toxicity in a Saudi patient.\n\n【17】The frequencies of the CYP2C9∗3 allele have been extensively studied and are known to vary significantly across different populations, as reported by the 1000 Genome Phase 3 project 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The European population exhibits a high frequency of the CYP2C9∗3 allele (11%), whereas its occurrence is rare in America (4%) and East Asia (3%) and absent in Africa. Conversely, South Asian populations, such as Pakistan (11.9%) and Bangladesh (11.6%), show a remarkably high prevalence of the CYP2C9∗3 allele. In Western Saudi populations, the presence of the CYP2C9∗3 allele reaches 54%, which is considerably higher than the reported frequencies in other populations (ranging from 0% to 11%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Regarding the CYP2C8∗3 allele, it emerges as the most prevalent variant allele among Europeans (11.2%) and Americans (6.7%). Similarly, in Western Saudi populations, the CYP2C8∗3 allele frequency is approximately 8.57%, accounting for 50.02% of all variant CYP2C8 alleles in Saudis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. In contrast, South Asians (<4%), Africans (2.1%), and East Asians (<1%) exhibit significantly lower frequencies of the CYP2C8∗3 allele. Given the notable prevalence of CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles within the Saudi population, there is a potential concern regarding an increased susceptibility of Saudis to experience ADRs specifically associated with drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 enzymes, including ibuprofen.\n\n【18】A previous study reported that subjects who were double-heterozygous or homozygous for the CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 alleles had significantly low clearance rates for ibuprofen, ranging between 7% and 27% of the average clearance rate for subjects carrying the wild-type alleles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The low clearance rate of individuals carrying the CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles resulted in an increase in ibuprofen plasma concentrations and half-life. Therefore, toxicity may occur more frequently or be more severe at higher plasma concentrations. In patients using ibuprofen, CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles significantly predict the likelihood of developing GI bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Our patient’s genetic test results revealed that the patient was homozygous for both CYP2C9∗3 and CYP2C8∗3 variant alleles. Therefore, the patient was considered a poor metabolizer of both the CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 enzymes, suggesting that the patient had a poor metabolism of ibuprofen.\n\n【19】In the case of the patient under investigation, ibuprofen was administered at a dosage of 600 mg, resulting in a total daily dose of 1200 mg, which is equal to the established Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for ibuprofen as designated by the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Recent research conducted by Forgerini et al. has demonstrated an increased risk of upper GI bleeding in individuals who carry the CYP2C9∗3 allele and are taking more than 0.5 DDDs of NSAIDs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Considering that our patient was a carrier of the CYP2C9∗3 allele and utilized ibuprofen at a dose more than 0.5 DDD, it indicates an augmented vulnerability to upper GI bleeding at administrated dosage. This finding may imply the existence of a gene-dose effect, where individuals with the CYP2C9∗3 allele are more likely to experience elevated risk and severity of NSAID-induced ADRs.\n\n【20】According to the CPIC guideline concerning CYP2C9 enzyme and NSAIDs, individuals identified as poor metabolizers for CYP2C9 should initiate ibuprofen therapy at a dosage ranging from 25% to 50% of the recommended initial dose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Careful titration of the dose is advised to attain a clinical response and reach a dose between 25% and 50% of the recommended amount. To align with each patient’s treatment objectives, it is recommended to administer ibuprofen for the shortest possible duration using the lowest effective dose. For CYP2C9 poor metabolizers, it is further recommended to consider prescribing alternative NSAIDs that do not undergo metabolism via the CYP2C9 enzyme, such as naproxen, sulindac, aspirin, or other pain management strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Furthermore, caution is warranted when prescribing ibuprofen to patients carrying the CYP2C8∗3 variant allele since the CYP2C8 enzyme also participates in the metabolism of ibuprofen. CPIC recommends a lower ibuprofen dose for CYP2C8 poor metabolizers. While the CYP2C8∗3 allele alone may not significantly reduce ibuprofen clearance, it is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the CYP2C9∗2 allele, resulting in impaired ibuprofen metabolism and elevated plasma levels of the drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence ibuprofen metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The choice of NSAID should be based on the patient’s treatment goals and toxicity risks.\n\n【21】The patient enrolled in our study has been undergoing methotrexate treatment for approximately one year as part of her RA management. Notably, over the past eight weeks, she has been self-administering ibuprofen without a prescribed regimen. Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential risks associated with the simultaneous use of methotrexate and NSAIDs in patients with RA. Multiple studies have consistently demonstrated that the concomitant use of methotrexate and NSAIDs can substantially increase the likelihood of experiencing severe ADRs. These ADRs encompass GI adverse effects, liver toxicity, acute renal failure, and cytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Notably, NSAIDs have been shown to elevate methotrexate levels in the blood, thereby amplifying the associated side effects of methotrexate therapy. A recent case report by Tun et al. documented a rare methotrexate-induced gastric ulcer. This case highlights the potential but rare GI complications arising from methotrexate use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Taking into consideration the patient’s concomitant use of methotrexate and NSAIDs, the upper GI bleeding observed could potentially be attributed to a drug-drug interaction. These findings emphasize the importance of exercising caution and implementing vigilant monitoring when managing patients who are prescribed both methotrexate and NSAIDs concurrently.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】Ibuprofen, a widely utilized NSAID for RA management, has been associated with potential ADRs, including GI ulcers and bleeding. These risks can be influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 genes. Although the CPIC does not recommend routine screening for CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 non-functional alleles before ibuprofen therapy, a comprehensive understanding of these genetic variations can assist in optimizing ibuprofen dosage and reducing the risk of ADRs in RA patients. Therefore, incorporating genetic testing into the clinical decision-making process for NSAID treatment in RA patients has significant implications. It enables personalized medicine approaches, optimizes dosage, minimizes ADRs, and facilitates long-term treatment planning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

After discharge, a progressive withdrawal of prednisone was accomplished. One year after, PAN has not relapsed.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】We have presented a case of PAN revealed by ischemic colitis necessitating acute surgical intervention.\n\n【21】Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), first described in 1866 by Kussmaul and Maier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, is systemic necrotizing vasculitis that predominantly affects medium sized arteries and is primary in most patients but is the consequence of viral infections, mainly hepatitis B virus (HBV), in some. Biopsy material can prove the diagnosis, especially if an affected area or lesion of the skin, muscle, or other tissue is available. The characteristic histopathological changes of PAN are fibrinoid necrosis of the walls of medium or small arteries, with a marked inflammatory response within or surrounding the vessel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【22】PAN involves the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in more than 50% of patients at some time during its course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Clinically apparent ischemic disease of the small bowel is the frequent site of involvement. The colon is less commonly involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The presentation of colonic PAN may mimic inflammatory bowel disease in young patients and atherosclerotic ischemic colitis in older ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Thus, any GI symptoms which are preceded by fever, weight loss, myalgia, or arthralgias should raise the possibility of vasculitis. In those patients who do not require an urgent intervention, a deep endoscopic biopsy must be taken. This can give the diagnosis without the need for surgery.\n\n【25】When studying 342 patients with PAN, Pagnoux found that GI involvement was present in 132 cases (37.9%) and was significantly more frequent in HBV related PAN (P < 0.001) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. GI manifestations requiring surgery were noted in 48 patients (13.8%). In multivariate analysis, Gl manifestations requiring surgery at diagnosis were associated with increased risk of death. Bourgarit et al. conclude that GI symptoms were most frequently associated with early death from HBV-PAN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Although GI involvement is frequent in PAN, the isolated abdominal initial presentation is uncommon, and since 1975, only 9 cases have been published in the English language literature. They are summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–15\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Table 1 Summary of reported cases of PAN presenting with ischemic colitis.\n\n【28】In the presence of acute abdominal signs, early surgery is warranted. In their absence, medical treatment should suffice. In all cases, close observation by a surgical team must be undertaken.\n\n【29】For many years, PAN treatment has involved administration of high-dose steroid with an additional cytotoxic agent, such as cyclophosphamide, to induce remission. In most patients, it is appropriate to treat aggressively. Once remission is achieved, maintenance therapy with daily or alternate-day low-dose prednisolone and oral azathioprine is frequently used for up to 18 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【30】PAN, unlike some other vasculitides such as Wegener granulomatosis, appears to be a condition in which permanent remission can be achieved. Relapses can occur, but despite these, a real possibility of cure can be anticipated. However, if treatment is delayed or inadequate, life-threatening complications can occur due to the vasculitic process.\n\n【31】#### 4\\.

We present a patient with pterygium colli and a low and laterally displaced nuchal hairline. Since its description, various surgical approaches have been implemented to correct the deformity. Previously reported posterior and lateral approaches have notable disadvantages with regard to hairline displacement and recurrence. In order to address these disadvantages, a new surgical technique was used on this patient. We have termed this technique an M to T rearrangement. Using a lateral approach, the M and T incisions are made and the trapezial fascial web is directly visualized and able to be completely excised. This prevents the recurrence seen with the use of posterior techniques. Inferolateral displacement of hair-bearing skin can be removed with resection of the superior intervening triangle and improves the appearance of the low nuchal hairline. The excision of excess skin along with the zig-zag closure also prevents postoperative scar contraction and recurrence. An important effect of this technique is the prevention of anterior displacement of hair bearing skin. M to T rearrangement is an effective technique for the correction of webbed neck deformities seen in Noonan and Turner syndromes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】A syndrome involving valvular pulmonary stenosis, small stature, hypertelorism, mild mental retardation, undescended testes, and skeletal abnormalities was first described by Noonan and Ehmke in 1963 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Noonan syndrome is characterized by short stature, congenital heart defect, and developmental delay of variable degree. Other findings can include broad or webbed neck, pectus deformity, cryptorchidism, characteristic facies, varied coagulation defects, lymphatic dysplasias, and ocular abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The syndrome is fairly common, as the incidence is estimated to be approximately 1 : 1,000–2,500 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance has been determined and attributed to missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12 in 50% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】For the Noonan syndrome patient, the most concerning physical defect is often congenital webbing of the neck or pterygium colli. Kobylinski initially reported this deformity in 1883 and the name “pterygium colli” was coined by Funke in 1902 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Pterygium colli involves an ectopic fibrotic facial band superficial to the trapezius muscle. Excess hair-bearing skin is also present and extends down the cervical region well beyond the normal hairline.\n\n【5】Since its description, various surgical approaches have been implemented to correct the deformity. Previously reported posterior and lateral approaches have notable disadvantages with regard to hairline displacement and recurrence. In order to address these disadvantages, a novel surgical technique was used on this patient. We have termed this technique an M to T rearrangement.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 13-year-old male was evaluated for congenital webbing of the neck secondary to Noonan syndrome. The patient presented with characteristic features of pterygium colli with a low and laterally displaced nuchal hairline. Presurgical testing did not reveal any coagulation abnormalities. These patients can often have specific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation anomalies, but none were noted with this patient. Surgical treatment was outlined to address both the neck and hairline abnormalities.\n\n【8】Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a prone position and the webbing was carefully marked from the mastoid to the acromion. A pinch test of the skin overlying the trapezius muscle was used to determine the excess . A horizontal incision was marked perpendicular to the web to form a “T.” This incision was placed parallel to a crease in the anterolateral neck. The length of this limb (releasing incision) was determined from the midpoint of the web line to the palpated edge of the pinch test.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | A pinch test of the skin overlying the trapezius muscle was used to determine the excess. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【10】A triangular flap whose apex was at the intersection of the limbs of the “T” was then marked. An equilateral triangle, with the limbs and base of the triangle measuring the same length as the releasing incision, was marked. It is paramount to orient the triangular flap in such a way so to exclude any hair-bearing skin that is commonly present in a patient with inferolateral displacement of the hairline. The base of the triangular flap is then connected to the superior and inferior edges of the webbing to form an “M” .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Markings for an M-T rearrangement.

This is an equilateral triangle, with the limbs and base of the triangle measuring the same length as the releasing incision.

The skin and subcutaneous tissue of the two intervening triangles that are present superior and inferior to the triangular flap were resected. The superior triangle usually incorporates the inferior and lateral displaced hairline and hair bearing skin. Then the fibrotic fascial band of the trapezius is fully visualized . The most important part of the procedure is to perform a complete excision of the trapezial fascial web in order to prevent recurrence. This effectively lengthened the trapezius and improved the neck profile .

Discussion\n\n【21】Numerous surgical approaches have been developed to correct the webbed neck deformity seen in Noonan’s and Turner’s syndromes. The primary goals of correction include normalizing the appearance of the neck, raising the low hairline. Previously reported techniques have attempted correction from lateral or posterior approaches.\n\n【22】In 1937, Chandler originally proposed surgical correction of the deformity via bilateral Z-plasties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A lateral approach allows for complete visualization of the web, but the use of a Z-plasty alone does not fully achieve desired aesthetic results. With this technique, the hair-bearing flap is rotated anteriorly and is visible on the lateral neck. Although the width of the neck is improved, future hair removal procedures would be indicated to achieve a normal appearance. Hikade et al. improved upon this technique by developing a modified Z-plasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. With this approach a lateral Z-plasty is performed, the hair-bearing flap is excised, and the resultant dog-ear is corrected by two additional Z-plasties. This allows for visualization of the web and eliminates the need for future hair removal on the lateral neck. Although a modified Z-plasty does achieve the goals of webbed neck correction, scars extend from just below the mastoid process to the acromion.\n\n【23】With a posterior approach, excess skin is excised from midline of the posterior neck. This flattens the web against the lateral neck to achieve an improved appearance. Shearin and DeFranzo described a posterior butterfly correction of a webbed neck deformity in a Turner’s patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Tension on the vertical limb of the scar caused considerable spreading and recurrence of the web. Similarly, Thomson et al. used a posterior approach and excised a midline ellipse of tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The incision and resultant dog ears were closed leaving a Y-shaped scar. As was also described by Shearin and DeFranzo, the vertical limb of this scar is under considerable tension, which makes recurrence of the web possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Hypertrophic scarring was noted postoperatively in this case. A recent study noted that five out of eleven patients had mild to moderate postoperative hypertrophic scarring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. They found that lateral techniques with incorporation of Z-plasties provided superior results. They showed, as with our patient, that overall patient satisfaction is very high but recommended accurate preoperative planning and counseling of patients and families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The M to T rearrangement described in this report offers considerable advantages to previously reported techniques. By using a lateral approach, the trapezial fascial web is directly visualized and able to be completely excised. This prevents the recurrence seen with the use of posterior techniques. Inferolateral displacement of hair-bearing skin can be removed with resection of the superior intervening triangle and improves the appearance of the low nuchal hairline. The excision of excess skin along with the zig-zag closure also prevents postoperative scar contraction and recurrence. An important effect of this technique is the prevention of anterior displacement of hair bearing skin. M to T rearrangement is a novel technique for effective surgical correction of webbed neck deformities seen in Noonan’s and Turner’s syndromes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is rarely complicated by amyloidosis. Case. A 66-year-old white male presented to the emergency room (ER) after an unwitnessed fall and change in mental status. Patient was awake and alert but not oriented. There was no focal deficit on neurological exam. Past medical history (PMH) included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, aortic valve replacement (nonmetallic), incomplete heart block controlled by a pacemaker and IgG- IgA type Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance. The MGUS was diagnosed 9 months ago on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) as patient was referred to the outpatient clinic for hyperglobulinemia on routine blood work. In ER, a head-computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions suspicious for metastases. A CT chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed numerous ground-glass and solid nodules in the lungs. Lower extremity duplex and transesophageal echocardiogram were negative. Serial blood cultures and serologies for cryptococcus and histoplasmosis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), cryoglobulin, and antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies were all negative. CT guided lung biopsy was positive for Thioflavin T amyloid deposits. Brain biopsy was positive for eosinophilic material (similar to the lungs) but negative for Thioflavin T stain. The patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate with cold cyanotic fingers developing on day 12 and a health care acquired pneumonia, respiratory failure, and fungemia on day 18. On day 29, family withdrew life support and denied any autopsies. Conclusion. Described is an atypical course of MGUS complicated by amyloidosis of the lung and nonamyloid eosinophilic deposition in the brain. As MGUS might be complicated by diseases such as amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, a scheduled follow-up of these patients is always necessary. Further research is needed in order to better define the optimal treatment and management strategies of MGUS and its complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】B cell dyscrasias are characterized by a clonal proliferation of B cells (benign or malignant). The spectrum of B cell dyscrasia is broad and includes the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. MGUS is found in more than 1% of persons who are 50 years or older and is defined by the presence of a serum monoclonal protein concentration less than 3 g/dL, with absence of lytic bone lesions, of M proteins in urine, of hypercalcemia and of renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Amyloidosis is a rare complication of MGUS which is secondary to excessive production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) and deposition of the single Ig isotype or subunits in various tissues. Aggregomas, on the other hand, are tumoral non-amyloidotic monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain deposits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this paper, we describe an unusual presentation of MGUS combining amyloid deposition in the lung and non-amyloid eosinophilic deposition in the Brain.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】A-66-year-old male, who was exsmoker, presented to the ER for a change in mental status. As per the family, the patient who had a normal mental status in the past was noticed to be progressively worsening for the last couple of months, with disorientation mainly found over phone discussions. At the time of presentation he was awake and alert, but disoriented to time and place. He denied any pain and was unable to provide any history. Physical exam was normal except for the presence of facial ecchymosis. The neurological part showed a normal motor, sensory, and cranial nerve exam. Also, his gait was stable.\n\n【6】Past medical history was significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, aortic valve replacement (nonmetallic), atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), incomplete heart block, pacemaker, and IgG- IgA, kappa type Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS). Family history was not relevant.\n\n【7】MGUS was diagnosed 9 months ago on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) as patient was referred to our institution’s center for cancer and blood related diseases for hyperglobulinemia on routine blood work. At that time the patient underwent extensive work up to rule out any plasma cell dyscrasias. The Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) was negative for M spike. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry from peripheral smear as well as from bone marrow biopsy were negative for a clonal plasma cell or malignant B-cell. Chromosomal analysis and cytogenetics were also normal.\n\n【8】In the ER, a head CT scan revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions suspicious for metastases mainly in the frontal part bilaterally and in the left parieto-temporal region, with edema and compression mainly on the left lateral ventricle. Also, an interventricular lesion at the foramen of Monro causing mild hydrocephalus was seen. CT chest, abdomen and pelvis was done to find a possible primary malignancy and revealed numerous ground-glass and solid nodules in the lungs. Warfarin was discontinued and the international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.2 was reversed with fresh frozen plasma. Patient was started on steroids and phenytoin. Lower extremity duplex was negative.\n\n【9】The clinical status continued to deteriorate with cold, cyanotic fingers developing on day twelve of hospitalization. At this point he was seen by a vascular surgeon in order to rule out arterial emboli. A transesophageal echocardiogram was done for possible vegetations causing infectious emboli. All results were negative, and no infiltrative cardiomyopathy was found. Bronchoscopy and broncho-alveolar lavage with cultures (including nocardia) was also negative. CT guided lung biopsy showed H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) and PAS (periodic acid-schiff) positive amorphous eosinophilic material suspicious for amyloid . Initial staining with congo red was negative. However, it stained positively with Thioflavin T stain and had weak green birefringence under polarized light. Immunostains for kappa and lambda chains showed stronger staining for kappa subtype. Brain biopsy was positive for eosinophilic material (similar to the lungs) but negative for congo red and thioflavin T stain . Later, the patient had a respiratory failure secondary to health care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and was intubated. Serial blood cultures and serologies for Cryptococcus and histoplasmosis, serology for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), cryoglobulin, and Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies (antiGBM) were all negative. Only seen was a positive blood culture for candida on day eighteen.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | CT guided lung biopsy showed H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) and PAS (periodic acid-schiff) positive amorphous eosinophilic material suspicious for amyloid.

Later, he was switched to vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin for possible health care acquired pneumonia. Also, he was started on amphotericin B after blood cultures revealed candida. Whether a more diffuse disease such as systemic amyloidosis is present was not confirmed, as the family refused any further diagnostic procedures that are not relevant to the acute care of the patient in a context of a deteriorating clinical picture. Despite all antifungals and supportive measures, he failed weaning trials and remained on ventilator support. A tracheostomy was suggested. However, after extensive discussions, the family refused. On day 29, health care proxy decided to withdraw all life support measures based on the patient’s previous wishes who did not want to be kept alive on a ventilator. Finally, the patient had a terminal wean after these events, and the family refused any autopsies.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】As we discussed above, MGUS is found in around 1% of persons who are 50 years or older and is defined by the presence of a serum monoclonal protein concentration less than 3 g/dL. MGUS of IgM class can progress to lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia; whereas IgA and IgG can progress to primary amyloidosis or multiple myeloma. B cell lymphoproliferative disorders can cause AL (light chain) amyloidosis, which is very rarely reported in MGUS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. Depending on the type of antibodies secreted, immunoglobulin deposition diseases can be divided into light chain amyloidosis (AL), heavy chain amyloidosis (AH), non-amyloid forms of light chain deposition diseases (LCDD), and heavy chain deposition diseases (HCDD). Coexistence of the amyloid and non-amyloid deposits is very rare, and was first described by Gallo et al. as “monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Biclonal gammopathy was described in less than 3 percent of the Mayo clinic MGUS series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The clinical course and behavior were not significantly different. Our patient had high levels of IgG 3730 mg/dL (range: 751–1560 mg/dL) and IgA 619 (range: 82–453 mg/dL). Immunofixation was positive for kappa chains which was consistent with the amyloid deposits in the lungs. These were highly positive for the kappa immunostaining. Therefore, we can suggest that one of the contributing causes for the respiratory failure in our case might have been the amyloidosis itself.\n\n【16】Also, found in our patient was multiple organizing hemorrhagic brain lesions suspicious for metastasis. However, no primary tumor was found and there was no evidence of lymphoproliferative diseases in the brain or lung biopsies. Hemorrhage in patients with MGUS can be secondary to amyloidosis or cryoglobulinemia. However, finding of eosinophilic non-amyloid material possibly suggests “Aggregoma” which is a very rare entity, only described once previously in the literature, as per our knowledge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Amyloid depositions seen in plasma cell dyscrasias can lead to amyloid angiopathy and secondary hemorrhagic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Light chain deposition diseases might mimic amyloidosis, leading also to bleeding susceptibilities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Our patient might have light chain deposition disease in the brain that did not lead to amyloidosis itself. However, this disease might have been the cause of significant parenchymal hemorrhages.\n\n【17】Further workup in order to define the exact nature of these depositions, like immunohistochemistries, ultra-structural analysis, and mass spectrometry, was not done, mainly due to technical and technological limitations in our institution. Also, we cannot rule out a possible systemic amyloidosis as no further diagnostic testing such as a fat pad biopsy was done. The family refused any workup that is not relevant to the acute care of the patient who was in a critical condition. Also, the final diagnosis was not ascertained as the autopsy was refused.\n\n【18】Although there were some indicators predicting the risk of progression to Multiple Myeloma (serum protein M ≥ 1.5, non-IgG MGUS), till now, there is no known indicators predicting the odds of amyloidosis formation. Periodic monitoring of MGUS is advised, but there is currently no recommended optimal intervals. Many experts recommend routine follow-up between 6 and 12 months. This is based mainly on the potential risk for multiple myeloma progression.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】This case describes two organ specific presentations related to the MGUS disease: amyloid deposition in the lung and non-amyloid eosinophilic deposition in the brain. The possibility of a presence of systemic amyloidosis and the final confirmation of the nature of the non-amyloid depositions in our case were not ascertained, mainly due to the refusal by the family for any autopsies or any further diagnostic procedures, but also view the lack of technological availabilities, mainly staining subtypes in our institution.\n\n【21】Knowing that the course of MGUS can be potentially complicated by amyloidosis, peripheral neuropathies, and multiple myeloma transformations, a scheduled follow-up of these patients is always necessary. Further research is needed in order to establish the optimal treatment guidelines for the complications and diseases related to MGUS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Gastric polypoid tumors vary in terms of histology, neoplastic potential, and management. Preoperative diagnosis is now extremely precise because of technical improvements in upper gastric endoscopy and medical imaging. However, it sometimes differs from the postoperative histopathologic diagnosis. Our case suggests the difficulties in precise diagnosis of the invasion depth of the giant polypoid cancer.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 66-year-old Japanese man undergoing hemodialysis for chronic renal failure was referred to our hospital with suspected duodenal cancer. On physical examination, his abdomen was soft and flat without symptoms. Tumor markers were within normal limits, and laboratory findings were normal except for renal dysfunction due to chronic renal failure. Upper gastric endoscopy revealed a giant polypoid-type tumor extending from the duodenum bulb to the pyloric ring; its main location was thought to be the duodenum bulb 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. The surface of the tumor was rough, but its outline was clear. A biopsy of the tumor showed atypical papillous epithelium containing goblet cells, and nuclei in the epithelium were p53-positive. An endoscopic ultrasound test suggested that the tumor might invade the muscular tunic 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. A computed tomography scan revealed a slightly enhanced lobular tumor (54 mm × 34 mm) protruding into the duodenum bulb, although serosal invasion was not detected 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. Positron emission tomography showed an accumulation of通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18</sup></u>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (60 mm × 34 mm, maximum standardized uptake value = 5.6) in the area extending from the antrum of the stomach to the duodenum bulb 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Because indications of endoscopic mucosal resection were not favored, the giant polypoid-type early gastric cancer that was expressed on the pyloric ring and confined within the mucosal layer was curatively removed via abdominal surgery. We performed a submucosal resection via an incision in the gastric anterior wall. The resected tumor was localized in the anterior wall of pyrolic ring. Intraoperative histopathological diagnosis with a frozen section suggested that the tumor contained adenocarcinoma components; therefore, we performed distal gastrectomy followed by Billroth II reconstruction. The extent of resection was from the lesser curvature of stomach, which was 5 cm from the pyrolic ring, to the duodenum, which was 4 cm from the pyrolic ring. The resected lymph nodes were number 3b, number 4d, number 5, and number 6. The histopathological diagnosis was papillary adenocarcinoma, and the invasion depth was the mucosal layer without vascular invasion 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a) and 3(b))</u>. There are no metastases in the removed lymph nodes and the numbers of resected lymph nodes were number 3b (0/1), number 4d (0/3), number 5 (0/1), and number 6 (0/4). The pathological stage was T1aN0M0- pStage IA. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was free from recurrence 1 year after the surgery.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Upper gastric endoscopy revealing a giant polypoid-type tumor extending from the duodenum bulb to the pyloric ring.

Discussion\n\n【10】Polypoid-type gastric tumors protruding into the duodenum bulb are very rare. Inlaying of the tumor sometimes results in ball-valve syndrome, which is obstruction of the duodenum bulb because of the inlaying of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In such cases, the reported symptoms are abdominal pain, vomiting, epigastralgia, and a sense of abdominal distension. Gastric polypoid tumors arise from the pyrolic ring or the antrum of the stomach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and are sometimes reported as early-stage cancers or leiomyomas. In such cases, they are usually pedunculated, and invasion depth is relatively shallow. In our case, gastrointestinal obstruction did not occur, because the mobility of the tumor was maintained and the tumor was soft. Because the tumor was pedunculated and the invasion depth was the mucosal layer without vascular invasion, it was clearly early-stage.\n\n【11】Gastric polyps are a heterogeneous group of epithelial and subepithelial lesions that vary in terms of histology, neoplastic potential, and management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Treatments for gastric tumors include abdominal surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and endoscopic submucosal dissection, and the choice of operative method depends on the invasion depth of the tumor which is determined via an endoscopic ultrasound test, as well as the neoplastic potential. Recently, it was reported that gastric polypectomy is a safe endoscopic treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In our case, the tumor was derived from an adenomatous polyp with high neoplastic potential; therefore, complete polypectomy and sampling of the surrounding mucosa were required. The invasion depth was estimated as the mucosal layer preoperatively; however, endoscopic treatment in our case was technically impossible because the stalk of the tumor was located on the pyloric ring, and working space was limited. Therefore, we firstly chose a submucosal resection via an abdominal incision based on preoperative assessment of a frozen section. However, the definitive diagnosis was adenocarcinoma, so we subsequently performed distal gastrectomy.\n\n【12】The tumor showed an accumulation of通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18</sup></u>F-fluorodeoxyglucose, and the invasion depth was the muscular tunic as estimated via an endoscopic ultrasound test.

The most common forms of systemic amyloidosis are primary amyloidosis (PA) of light chains and secondary amyloidosis (SA) caused by chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although involvement of the thyroid gland by amyloid is a relatively common phenomenon, clinically significant enlargement of the thyroid owing to amyloid deposition is a rare occurrence. In SA, the deposition of amyloid associated (AA) protein is associated with atrophy of thyroid follicles. The clinical picture of these patients is characterized by rapid, painless thyroid gland enlargement which may be associated with dysphagia, dyspnea, or hoarseness. Thyroid function is not impaired in most cases. Although amyloid goitre secondary to systemic amyloidosis due to chronic inflammatory diseases is relatively common, specifically related to RA is much more uncommon one and it is reported less in the literature. In this report, A 52-old-year female patient with amyloid goiter associated with amyloidosis secondary to rheumatoid arthritis is presented.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Amyloidosis refers to a variety of conditions in which amyloid proteins are abnormally deposited in organs and/or tissues. Primary amyloidosis (PA) arises from a disease with disordered immune cell function such as multiple myeloma and other immunocyte dyscrasias. Secondary (reactive) amyloidoses (SA) are those occurring as a complication of some other chronic inflammatory or tissue destructive diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that results in a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that may affect many tissues and organs.\n\n【4】The most common forms of systemic amyloidosis are PA of light chains and SA caused by chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. James first reported the presence of clinically detectable thyroid enlargement because of amyloid deposition in 1858, followed by Eiselberg in 1904, who later coined the term “amyloid goitre” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although involvement of the thyroid gland by amyloid is a relatively common phenomenon, clinically significant enlargement of the thyroid owing to amyloid deposition is an extremely rare occurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. It affects the thyroid in a bilateral and diffuse manner. Preoperatively it simulates a multinodular goitre and surgical intervention is often necessary to establish a diagnosis and to relieve compressive symptoms of a neck mass. Here, in this case report, a 52-old-year female patient with amyloid goiter associated with amyloidosis secondary to RA is presented.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】The patient was a 52-year-old woman that is referred to the general surgery clinic presenting with increasing dyspnea and a visible swelling at the base of the neck for the last two years. She had been diagnosed with RA six years ago but had not used the prescribed medication regularly. The thyroid gland was rough in palpation. In laboratory data, free T4: 1.26 ng/dL (N: 0.82–1.77 ng/dL), TSH: 0.243 mIU/mL (N: 0.27–4.2 mIU/mL), and thyroid autoantibodies such as Anti-TPO (antithyroid peroxidase) and anti-Tg (antithyroglobulin) were found to be negative. Other laboratory findings were WBC: 8000, Hb: 9.6 g/DL, Hct: 29.4%, MCV: 89.3 fL, Plt: 216000 μL, urea: 89 md/dL, and creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL, and hepatic function tests were found to be normal. Both of the thyroid lobes were enlarged in the ultrasound examination. In the right lobe, we found smooth, multiple nodules of 45–50 mm size that contained cystic degeneration areas. Biopsy specimens driven by fine needle aspiration did not show any malignant findings. Renal ultrasound examination revealed grade II nephropathy. Total thyroidectomy was performed because of the evident pressure symptoms. Thyroid tissue was found to be very rough and the histopathological examination revealed that macroscopically the right lobe was 12 × 6 × 5 cm in size and contained four nodules of 45–50 mm size. The size of the left lobe was 10 × 6 × 5 cm and the whole material was in pale grey-brown colour. The resected material was stained with haematoxylin-eosin dye and revealed an expansive amorphous eosinophilic substance deposition and lipid infiltration in the whole thyroid gland . An adenomatous hyperplasia was also found in the right lobe. On Congo red dye staining, amyloid deposition was stained red in the interstitial space and it showed an apple-green birefringence with the polarizing microscope . Amyloid deposition was sensitive to alkaline (potassium permanganate), causing fading of the stain. In the postoperative 16th month, chronic renal failure occurred and haemodialysis treatment was started. Nine months later, the patient died of myocardial infarction.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Expansive amorphous eosinophilic substance deposition and lipid infiltration in the whole thyroid gland (HE ×200). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Amyloid deposition stained red in the interstitial space and apple-green birefringence with the polarizing microscope (Kongo ×100). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】The preoperative diagnosis of amyloid goiter should be considered in patients with known systemic amyloidosis or with a long-standing predisposing disease who present a rapidly growing thyroid volume in association with an euthyroid state.\n\n【11】In our patient, amyloid goiter probability had been considered but because of the evident pressure symptoms, after FNA examination, surgery was performed rather than diagnosing a systemic amyloidosis preoperatively. In the literature, there are findings about the decreasing in the symptoms and amyloid goiter after treatment of the primary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【12】In autopsy studies, amyloid material is found in the thyroid gland of 80% of patients with SA and 50% of patients with PA. In a study, a systematic review of the published data on amyloid goiter was carried out for the period from 1951 to March 2008. A total of 127 publications (case series, single-case reports, and reviews) were found, of which 31 were case series published from February 1995 to March 2008 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Although involvement of the thyroid gland by amyloid is a relatively common phenomenon, clinically significant enlargement of the thyroid owing to amyloid deposition is a rare occurrence. Although it is very rare, in some cases isolated thyroid amyloidosis may be seen as chronic inflammatory diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the present case, high levels of urea and creatinine preoperatively and the necessity of haemodialysis postoperatively because of chronic renal failure make us think that the amyloidosis was systemic in the patient. Unfortunately, we had not performed renal biopsy.\n\n【13】In every patient with RA who is presenting with symptoms of goitre, amyloid goitre must be taken into consideration.

Introduction\n\n【3】Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common RBC abnormality, affecting 400 million people globally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Neonatal jaundice, hemolytic anemia, icteric skin, dark urine, and fever are usually the first signs of this condition, which is generally diagnosed between the ages of infancy and 16 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Therefore, the first onset of this disease in old age is an unexpected phenomenon that is one of the rare aspects of our case. On the other hand, although G6PD is a benign hematologic condition, an acute hemolytic crisis triggered by oxidative agents such as fava beans, medications (like hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)), or infections might be its most life-threatening clinical presentation.\n\n【4】HCQ is a renowned drug in the treatment of malaria, and it has lately been widely used as a trial medication to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). HCQ is a forbidden medication in G6PD patients, but recent investigations have challenged its role in causing hemolytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, following the prevalence of COVID-19 and the widespread usage of this drug, cases of hemolytic anemia in COVID-19 patients and their recovery after discontinuation of this drug were reported, which led us to collect these studies and review them thoroughly. Here, we introduce a 70-year-old man with no past medical history of G6PD deficiency who was admitted to our hospital for COVID-19 infection and experienced acute hemolytic anemia in the setting of HCQ therapy for COVID-19-related pneumonia.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 70-year-old man presented to our emergency department with a dry cough three days before admission, dyspnea, and a positive result from the recent COVID-19 PCR test. He had a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, high blood pressure, and hypothyroidism. After the initial evaluation, his oxygen saturation was at 90%, and a mild fever was detected. Therefore, we started with 2 liters of oxygen with a nasal cannula. A high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed, and multiple patchy infiltrations were reported. Shortly after his admission, his oxygen saturation decreased to 75%, so we transferred him to the intensive care unit (ICU). Following our institutional protocol, he started on 800 mg HCQ on day one, then, 200 mg twice a day for four days. Then, we noticed a slight decrease in his hemoglobin level while he was receiving his first course of the HCQ, but his hemoglobin level stabilized after the first course of treatment. The laboratory courses of the patient's hemoglobin and creatinine level are illustrated in Figure 1. Afterward, a subsequent HRCT was performed and showed severe involvement of his lungs. Consequently, according to the promising results around HCQ's role in the treatment of COVID-19 at that time, we started the second treatment course with this drug; however, after three days, we noticed a severe reduction in his hemoglobin level again. Therefore, we stopped the HCQ and packed cell transfusion started for him. His peripheral blood smear (PBS) revealed peripheral schistocytes, which were in favor of hemolytic anemia. According to the previous G6PD history in his first-degree relatives, a G6PD level test was requested, and the diagnosis of G6PD was established. Ultimately, he was discharged in good condition by discontinuing HCQ as a G6PD stimulus and transfusing several bags of pack cells.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Laboratory course of the patient's hemoglobin and creatinine during hospitalization.</u>\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】The COVID-19 pandemic, which was initiated in December 2019, has many more dimensions yet to be revealed. One of these aspects is G6PD-deficient patients. G6PD is the most common red cell enzymatic disorder worldwide, and 400 to 500 million people are affected by one of its subtypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The role of COVID-19 in this disorder has not been adequately studied. Infections, especially viral infections by increasing oxidative stress, have previously been recognized as a trigger for G6PD deficiency, but more studies are needed on the consequences of COVID-19 in G6PD deficient patients. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. On the other hand, the drug HCQ, an antimalarial medication, was introduced as one of the early experimental treatments for COVID-19. This drug, along with COVID-19 infection, was an additional cause to explain hemolysis in G6PD patients. Therefore, for an adequate understanding of this issue, our team conducted an advanced search strategy using keywords and mesh terms in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to find more cases with COVID-19 infection that used HCQ as a treatment and had hemolysis, which results are presented in Table 1.\n\n【10】Table 1 Characteristics of 11 included studies.\n\n【11】In some cases, which we included in Table 1, HCQ administration has been recommended as the main reason for patients' hemolysis. But some of the other investigations propose otherwise. In a retrospective cohort survey by Mohammad et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, in 2018, which analyzed 275 patients with rheumatic disease who had exposure to HCQ for more than 700 months, none of their 11 patients diagnosed with G6PD and simultaneously HCQ reported hemolysis was used. Similarly, in one of the cases mentioned in our table, they started HCQ on the 6th day of admission. Still, their retrospective evaluation of daily smear demonstrated a significant number of hemighost cells and microspherocytes from the 4th day of admission (2 days before they start HCQ), and their number increased gradually until the 7<sup>th</sup> day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Although chloroquine is mentioned in the list of drugs that can lead to hemolysis in G6PD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, it does not seem that a short duration of HCQ administration, which hospitals used for the treatment of COVID-19, could cause such severe hemolysis in the absence of another oxidative stress like a systemic infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Therefore, we assume that COVID-19 infection was the principal basis and primary trigger, which in combination with HCQ as a secondary agent; it induced hemolysis in G6PD patients. The interesting point about our case is that he did not experience even one episode of a hemolytic crisis in his lifetime, despite his continuous consumption of fava beans and G6PD unmasked just after his involvement with the COVID-19 virus and HCQ administration in the hospital.\n\n【12】In conclusion, G6PD is the most common enzymatic disorder in red blood cells and can lead to a hemolytic crisis, which can be associated with severe consequences such as death. COVID-19 should be considered a potent oxidative stress factor in these patients, especially since it is periodically treated with G6PD-exacerbating drugs such as HCQ.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Only the preventive medication such as oral sodium cromoglycate and oral combined cetirizine-montelukast was tried in FDEIA. Specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) using IFN-gamma was tried in 2 cases of FDEIA for wheat. Merely, exercise accompanied every treatment just after the intake of allergenic foods during treatment. Patients acquired tolerance for wheat in both cases successfully. After treatment, two patients take wheat in their food living freely. Conclusively, SOTI using IFN-gamma was effective as the causative treatment for allergenic foods in FDEIA.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Anaphylaxis induced by exercise after the intake of certain foods is referred to as food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA). Since Maulitz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> reported the first case of anaphylaxis induced by exercise after the intake of seafood in 1979, Kidd et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> called this condition FDEIA with the report of a case of anaphylaxis after intake of celery in 1983. The most common causative food is wheat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. For prevention of FDEIA, it is important not to eat the causative food before exercise and to avoid exercise after the intake of allergenic food 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】There were several trials in FDEIA for the preventive medication such as oral sodium cromoglycate (SCG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and oral combined cetirizine-montelukast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, there has been no causative treatment for FDEIA. Specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) for food allergy has been tried recently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In particular, SOTI using IFN-gamma was completely successful for IgE-mediated anaphylactic food allergy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. SOTI using IFN-gamma was successfully tried for FDEIA by wheat in this report.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】The patient was a 24-year-old woman weighing 44 kg. There was nothing notable in her family history. In 2008 (when she was 18 years old), she developed generalized urticaria, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, pale complexion, and loss of consciousness with running after intake of pork cutlet for the first time. She visited the emergency room and was treated with emergency care for anaphylaxis. Thereafter, she showed several history of severe generalized urticaria after intake of foods which contain wheat such as pork cutlet, pizza, spaghetti, and noodle. However, she did not show anaphylactic reactions including systemic urticaria every time when she took food containing wheat. She had to visit the emergency room because of anaphylaxis two times in the similar situation. After that, wheat was eliminated in her food living and there have been no symptoms and signs.\n\n【8】She visited the Republic of International Allergy Center, Pyeongtaek International Hospital (Pyeongtaek, Korea), for the tolerance induction for wheat from June 2012. It is recognized that anaphylaxis occurred with running until out of breath just after intake of food-containing foods in the past history.\n\n【9】###### 2.1.1. Laboratory Tests\n\n【10】Blood eosinophil % was 0.3%. Serum total IgE level was 90.8 KU/L. Specific IgE levels were 1.13 KU/L for wheat and not detected for eggs, milk, and soybeans. However, specific IgE was 0.55 KU/L for Dp and 0.40 KU/L for Df. The results of skin prick test for wheat are +++ (wheal size were 4 mm for eggs, 4 mm for histamine, and 0 mm for normal saline). Skin prick test for eggs, milk, soybeans, Dp, and Df is negative.\n\n【11】###### 2.1.2. OFC\n\n【12】Exercise provocation without intake of wheat was performed by running until out of breath for 10 minutes. Patients did not show any symptoms and signs by exercise provocation test. Food challenge tests were conducted according to the protocol for IgE-mediated anaphylactic food allergy as described in the previous report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Wheat was given 6 times for three days with amount of 120 g as breakfast and dinner. Also, patients did not show any symptoms and signs by oral challenge test. However, allergy provocation occurred with exercise just after exercise by running until out of breath for 10 minutes. The severity scores were 0 before and 2000 after oral food challenge with exercise at the dose of 10 g of noodle . The symptoms and signs were generalized urticaria with rash, respiratory difficulty with choking sensation, hypotension, and palpitation. The food-dependent, exercise-induced food allergy (FDEIA) for wheat was made.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Diagnosis of food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) and the changes of clinical severity by oral challenge test and exercise provocation test (Case 1).

Treatment\n\n【15】Specific oral tolerance induction using IFN-gamma for wheat was performed. Noodle was used for wheat allergen. The patient took scheduled dose of wheat 10 minutes after receiving IFN-gamma 2,000,000 units for 10 minutes. After the intake of wheat, the patient ran for 10 minutes until out of breath. The initial dose is 0.01 g, and the dose of wheat was increased according to the protocol in the previous report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Basically, the treatment followed the protocol for specific oral tolerance induction for IgE-mediated anaphylactic food allergy. The only difference from specific oral tolerance induction for food allergy was that the exercise was performed just after the intake of allergenic foods.\n\n【16】The patient showed allergy provocation many times during the treatment at the variable doses . Emergency care was done and treatment was restarted after a week. The treatment was repeated for the same dose until allergy provocation was not occurred at the same dose according to the principle of overcome of the dose of allergy provocation. The treatment was finished after 4 months days with 90 times of treatment.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Clinical course of specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) using IFN-gamma for food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) (Case 1).

Case 2\n\n【20】The patient was a 36-year-old woman weighing 52 kg. There was nothing notable in her family history. In 2001 (when she was 27 years old), she developed generalized urticaria, dyspnea with chocking sensation of throat, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of consciousness with running after intake of noodle for the first time. She also received emergency care for anaphylaxis. She showed frequent history of emergency care due to loss of consciousness as a symptom of anaphylaxis with running just after intake of wheat. Anaphylactic reactions never occurred only by wheat intake or only by exercise. She has kept restriction diet for wheat in her food living for the prevention of anaphylaxis.\n\n【21】She visited the Republic of Allergy Center, Department of Paediatrics, Chungnam National University Hospital (Daejeon, Korea), for the tolerance induction for wheat in 2010.\n\n【22】###### 2.2.1. Laboratory Tests\n\n【23】Blood eosinophil % was 5.1%. Serum total IgE level was 250.2 KU/L. Specific IgE levels were 4.1 KU/L for wheat and not detected for eggs, milk, and soybeans. However, specific IgE was 2.32 KU/L for Dp and 2.25 KU/L for Df. The results of skin prick test for wheat are +++ (wheal sizes were 3 mm for eggs, 3 mm for histamine and 0 mm for normal saline). Skin prick test for eggs, milk, soybeans, Dp, and Df is negative.\n\n【24】###### 2.2.2. OFC\n\n【25】She was negative in exercise provocation test without intake of wheat by running until out of breath for 10 minutes and in oral food challenge for wheat which was performed as described previously. Allergy provocation occurred at the dose of 30 g with exercise just after exercise by running until out of breath for 10 minutes with the severity scores of 2500. The symptoms and signs were generalized urticaria with rash, respiratory difficulty with choking sensation, hypotension, and palpitation. The food-dependent, exercise-induced food allergy (FDEIA) for wheat was made.\n\n【26】###### 2.2.3. Treatment\n\n【27】SOTI using IFN-gamma was performed. Noodle was used for wheat allergen. Scheduled dose of wheat was tried 10 minutes after receiving IFN-gamma 2,000,000 units within 10 minutes. After the intake of wheat, she ran for 10 minutes until out of breath. The initial dose is 0.01 g, and the dose of wheat was increased according to the protocol. The treatment followed the protocol for specific oral tolerance induction for IgE-mediated anaphylactic food allergy with just addition of exercise just after the intake of allergenic food.\n\n【28】The patient also showed allergy provocation many times during the treatment at the variable doses. Emergency care was done when she showed anaphylactic reactions. Treatment was restarted after a week. The treatment was repeated for the same dose until allergy provocation was not occurred at the same dose according to the principle of overcome of the dose of allergy provocation. The treatment was finished after 12 months days with 310 times of treatment.\n\n【29】After treatment, patient received oral food challenge with 120 g of wheat for the confirmation of tolerance acquisition. The patient show any symptoms and signs even with running just after intake of wheat no more for more than 2 years.\n\n【30】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【31】Specific oral tolerance induction using IFN-gamma was effective for the causative treatment of FDEIA. FDEIA is a form of IgE-mediated anaphylactic food allergy (IFA) caused by exercise after the intake of certain foods. The only difference between IFA and FDEIA is that FDEIA was provoked by exercise after intake of allergenic foods. Its major symptoms are also similar to IFA including generalized urticaria, angioedema (including facial swelling), respiratory impairment, hypotension, and disturbance of consciousness. Allergenic food in this report was wheat in both cases. The most common causative food was wheat, and it was reported that 60% of FDEIA was wheat dependent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Elimination diet for the allergenic foods in FDEIA is a way of prevention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. For prevention of FDEIA, it is important to avoid exercise after causative food intake; see also 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, patients possibly take foods containing allergenic foods without recognition because of many reasons. Preventive medication was also tried using oral sodium cromoglycate (SCG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and oral combined cetirizine-montelukast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. When SCG was administered orally to food allergy patients before food intake, it reduced the symptoms. SOTI using IFN-gamma was completely successful in the treatment of IgE-mediated anaphylactic food allergy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. SOTI using IFN-gamma was applied to FDEIA and as we expected, SOTI using IFN-gamma was successful as a causative treatment with modified protocol in which exercise provocation should be included just after the intake of allergenic food. Both patients did not show any symptoms and signs with any exercise after intake of wheat for more than 2 years, and they got the tolerance for the allergenic foods. There has been no causative treatment for FDEIA except temporary preventive symptomatic treatment as described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. However, the severity of disease is fatal, although the patients are always exposed to the causative allergens in their daily living. This treatment is recommended for all FDEIA patients.\n\n【33】Allergy provocation and achievement of tolerance occurred in the low-dose zone for anaphylactic IgE-mediated food allergy and in the high-dose zone for non-IgE-mediated food allergy. Interestingly, the tolerance acquisition of tolerance occurred in the high-dose zone in FDEIA, even though the characteristics of FDEIA are IgE-mediated food allergy. IgE-mediated food allergy seems to be consisted of heterogeneous diseases.\n\n【34】Anaphylaxis is not the disease and rather a group of symptoms and signs which may be provoked by multiple causes. Moreover, exercise seems to be aggravation factor rather than the cause. So, exercise-induced food allergy (EIFA) may be a more precise terminology than food-dependent exercise-induced food allergy (FDEIA). Further clinical trial and basic studies may be needed. Conclusively, SOTI using IFN-gamma was effective as the causative treatment for allergenic foods in FDEIA or EIFA.\n\n【35】#### Abbreviations\n\n| FDEIA: | Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis |\n| --- | --- |\n| SOTI: | Specific oral tolerance induction. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This is of particular importance for patients undergoing myocardial revascularization since this infection can be a trigger for the formation of restenosis in the area of a previously implanted coronary stent. Understanding the risk factors for stent thrombosis and restenosis is of particular importance in individuals at risk for adverse outcomes. The rarity of such situations makes the present study unique. Objective. Studying the peculiarities of restenosis and thrombosis of the coronary arteries in patients after coronavirus infection. Methods. The study was performed in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Emergency Hospital, Semey City, in 2021. We have examined the medical records of 10 consecutive patients with restenosis of coronary arteries after coronavirus infection and 10 matched-by-age patients with similar restenosis of coronary arteries who did not have coronavirus infection as a comparison group. To determine statistically significant differences between independent samples, we calculated the Mann–Whitney U test. Results. The average age of patients was 65.7 years. Only one case was classified as early restenosis (within 8 days of previous revascularization), two cases represented late restenosis, and seven cases were very late restenoses. In 70% of cases, restenosis was localized in the left anterior descending artery, in 30% of cases, it was in the right coronary artery, and in 40% of cases, it was in the left circumflex artery. In comparison with patients who did not have a coronavirus infection, there were statistically significant differences regarding IgG () and fibrinogen (). Conclusion. Patients with myocardial revascularization in the past have a higher risk of stent restenosis against the background of coronavirus infection due to excessive neointimal hyperplasia, hypercoagulability, increased inflammatory response, and endothelial dysfunction.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The gold standard for the treatment of coronary artery disease is myocardial revascularization using stents, balloon angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass grafting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Advances in myocardial revascularization, the introduction of drug-eluting stents, and effective antithrombotic therapy have made coronary restenosis rare in recent years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed our point of view about this pathology. This infection promotes thrombosis of arterial vessels and acts as a provoking factor in the development of acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the high burden on the healthcare system and the sharply increased need for resources, the activity of interventional cardiology around the world decreased significantly, reducing the number of cardiac catheterization procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, the need for repeated cardiac surgery for restenosis of coronary vessels increased against the background of coronavirus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Understanding the risk factors for stent thrombosis and restenosis is of particular importance in individuals at risk for adverse outcomes, especially in elderly patients with associated diseases.\n\n【5】##### 1.1.

Methods\n\n【8】The study was performed in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Emergency Hospital, Semey City, Kazakhstan, from May 2021 to December 2021. We have examined the medical records of ten consecutive patients with restenosis of coronary arteries after coronavirus infection and ten matched-by-age patients with a similar restenosis of coronary arteries who did not have coronavirus infection as a comparison group. In all patients during restenosis, stents of the third generation were installed (Resolute Integrity, Promus Premier, Xience Alpine, BioMatrix, and Orsiro). The clinical data of patients were collected from electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical symptoms and signs, coexisting conditions, imaging findings, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes. Data on previous myocardial revascularization and coronavirus infection were found retrospectively from medical records. For all patients, the diagnosis was made by experienced specialists. All reported events were verified by hospital electronic records from Complex Medical Information System and adjudicated by two cardiologists in consensus. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013) and approved by the institutional ethical committee of Semey Medical University (reference number 7 from 16.03.2021). Informed consent and permission to publish were provided by the patients.\n\n【9】The study design is prospective single-center case series.

At the control angiography: the lumen of the arteries was restored and the blood flow through the artery was TIMI III flow.  \nClinical characteristics and data of instrumental examination of persons with restenosis who underwent COVID-19 and comparison group are presented in Table 1. The average age of the studied patients was 65.7 years (from 46 to 80 years); in the comparison group, it was 66.2 years. All patients of the studied group were hospitalized for acute coronary artery disease requiring myocardial revascularization; seven of them had STEMI and three had NSTEMI (diagnosis confirmed by ECG), in comparison group situation was the same. Acute coronavirus infection (CVI) was observed only in two patients out of 10 cases (Cases 4 and 7); in one of them, severe COVID-associated pneumonia was diagnosed with a fatal outcome caused by acute heart failure. The second patient had a repeated case of CVI with an interval of 11 months after previous COVID-associated pneumonia against the background of pulmonary fibrosis and chronic respiratory failure of the III degrees, requiring constant oxygen support. The rest of the patients underwent CVI for the previous period from one month (Cases 1 and 9) to 8 months; infection was confirmed by elevated IgG levels .  \nSigns of acute respiratory failure, accompanied by a decrease in oxygen saturation, tachycardia, and tachypnea, were observed in six patients in the studied group. All patients of the studied group received oxygen support. Signs of respiratory distress syndrome were noted in two patients. In the comparison group, decreased oxygen saturation was found in three patients; however this rate was not less than 95%. There were no statistically significant differences in this indicator in the studied groups ().  \nPrevious myocardial revascularization in the studied group was carried out in terms of 8 days (Case 6) to 14 years. In three patients, the ejection fraction according to echocardiography was intact; in three patients, it was moderately reduced; in the remaining patients, it was decreased. In all cases, restenosis of the coronary arteries was observed; in most cases, its localization was the LAD; in three cases, it was RCA; in four cases, it was LCx. In the comparison group, the predominant localization was LAD (five cases), and in four cases, it was RCA. Decreased injection fraction in this group was found in five cases. There were no statistically significant differences in this rate in the studied groups (). In all cases, the underlying disease was accompanied by hypertension, and 40% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus.  \nAnalyzing laboratory parameters, all persons of the studied group had confirmation of a past coronavirus infection in accordance with the levels of IgM and IgG . In comparison with patients who did not have a coronavirus infection, there were no statistically significant differences regarding IgM (the rate of acute infection); however, such differences were found for IgG (indicator of CVI in the history) (; respectively).  \nLymphopenia and thrombocytopenia characteristic of CVI were noted only in the case of a deceased patient (Case 4); he also had a pronounced leukocytosis, indicating the addition of a bacterial infection. In three cases, moderate leukocytosis was noted against the background of high levels of cardiac markers. A high D-dimer was found only in two cases (one case of acute CVI, the second in a patient who had CVI three months ago). With regard to the lipid profile, almost all patients showed a tendency to increase LDL levels to the upper limit of normal values, while HDL levels were at or below the lower limit of normal. There were not any statistically significant differences in the studied and comparison groups regarding these biochemical rates; however, for the fibrinogen level, such differences were significant ().\n\n【22】Table 1 Clinical characteristics and data of instrumental examination of persons with restenosis who underwent CVI.\n\n【23】Table 2 Laboratory indicators characterizing the presence of recurrent stent thrombosis in persons who underwent CVI.\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Restenosis is angiographically confirmed a narrowing of the lumen of the coronary artery by more than 50%, localized in the area of a previously implanted stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Most often, restenosis develops within the first three months after previous revascularization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. After six months, the risks of restenosis decrease and the process remains stable; since during this period, stent endothelization and remodeling of the coronary artery wall are completed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The mechanism for early restenosis development is associated with trauma to the vascular wall during device implantation, leading to an inflammatory response accompanied by the migration of neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, and the release of inflammatory mediators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Subsequently, the induction of migration of smooth muscle cells into the intima of the vessel with their accumulation and proliferation of fibroblasts is observed. Increased synthesis of the extracellular matrix causes thickening of the neoadventitia and neointima, narrowing the lumen of the coronary artery in the area of the preimplanted stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Thus, there is a direct relationship between the development of inflammation, the formation of neointima, and the development of restenosis at the site of the implanted stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. After the damage to the intima of the coronary artery by a stent and increased platelet aggregation, their adhesion and secretion contribute to the induction of migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Coronavirus infection is characterized by an acute systemic inflammatory response that can lead to a cytokine storm. A prothrombotic environment and platelet activation aggravate the situation and increase the risk of thrombosis. An increase in the level of tissue thromboplastin leads to an increase in the level of thrombin and fibrin synthesis with the possible development of disseminated intravascular coagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>. Therefore, coronavirus infection can be a trigger for the formation of restenosis in the area of a previously implanted coronary stent through a complex mechanism, which can cause complications in the long-term period after CVI.\n\n【27】In the article, we presented a description of ten cases of coronary arteries restenosis in patients who had a coronavirus infection in comparison with the matched patients who had restenosis without CVI. In each group, only one case was classified as subacute restenosis, the other cases represented late or very late restenosis.\n\n【28】The available literature sources mainly provide information on cases of acute thrombosis of coronary artery stents after coronavirus infection. Thus, in a study conducted in Spain, a sharp increase in the frequency of stent thrombosis during the peak of the pandemic in March–April 2020 was noted, with a decrease in the frequency of coronary interventions by 38% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. These data were later confirmed by the results of other similar studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 17\\]</u>. A feature of our study is the development of restenosis of previously implanted stents in patients at different times after CVI. Only in two cases, coronavirus infection was present at the time of development of restenosis, of which in one case the patient had severe COVID-associated pneumonia with a fatal outcome, in the second case the patient had a repeated episode of an asymptomatic infection confirmed by a high level of IgM. However, given the low percentage of restenosis of coronary artery stents worldwide, our results suggest a possible association between recent CVI and stent restenosis.\n\n【29】In patients included in our study, the incidence of comorbidities did not differ from the comparison group and other populations of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Endothelial dysfunction induced by arterial hypertension, diabetes, or obesity contributes to the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells and the formation of neointimal hyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【30】An increase in the level of fibrinogen in the blood plasma can serve as a predictor of restenosis after endovascular stenting. Fibrinogen, accumulating in the atherosclerotic ally affected intima, penetrates into the arterial wall, where it binds to lipoprotein-α, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which in turn triggers the synthesis of mediators involved in thrombosis. Growth factors, actively produced by platelets and monocytes, have a potentiating effect on hyperplasia and the proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells, thereby triggering the process of restenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In our study, in 60% of patients of the studied group, the fibrinogen level significantly exceeded normal values, and in the other patients, it was the upper limit of normal values, which could be associated not only with coronary heart disease but also with a previous coronavirus infection. In the patients included in our study, the level of lipoproteins practically did not go beyond the limits of normal values, which could be explained by the development of late and very late stent restenoses in them.\n\n【31】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【32】The results of our study suggest that patients with myocardial revascularization in the past have a higher risk of developing stent restenosis against the background of coronavirus infection due to excessive neointimal hyperplasia, hypercoagulability, increased inflammatory response, and endothelial dysfunction. Coronavirus infection can be a trigger for restenosis even in the long-term period after the disease, which is due to the long-term inflammatory process in the vascular wall and vascular remodeling associated with the activation of fibrosis processes. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of restenosis and thrombosis in patients after COVID-19.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosing this rare condition is still very challenging in the daily clinical routine. In this report we present a case of a lethal sudden pulmonary tumour embolism in a 71-year-old male patient, who was admitted for elective invasive coronary angiography due to suspected coronary artery disease. The patient had suspected Ormond’s disease and no previous history of tumour burden. Possible diagnostic and treatment options are discussed herein and an overview of the current literature is also presented.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pulmonary tumour embolisms are a rare and in most cases sudden cause of death. First described in 1897 by Schmidt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, many patients present with unspecific symptoms and unknown primary tumours. So far, only reviews of case series have been reported, and a large percentage of such patients end with lethal complications. The pathophysiology is currently not entirely understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In this regard, rapid and effective diagnostic and appropriate treatment strategies are a challenge for clinicians who treat such patients. In recent review articles, several diagnostic algorithms have been discussed. Such algorithms, however, have been developed for the diagnostic work-up of thrombotic embolisms and are therefore not always helpful in patients with carcinoma associated embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. In this context, it is not surprising that fibrinolytic therapy has been unsuccessful in such cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Herein, we present a case of tumour associated embolism in a patient with suspected Ormond’s disease.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 71-year-old patient was admitted to our department for elective coronary angiography due to suspected coronary artery disease. His main complaint was typical angina at moderate exertion (CCS class II). Additionally, he reported swelling in the scrotum and his right leg during the past 6 months. A deep vein thrombosis was ruled out by negative Doppler sonography. A computed tomography (CT) scan on the other hand showed diffuse proliferation of fibrous tissue in the retroperitoneum, compatible with Ormond’s disease . Endoscopic evaluation demonstrated mild gastritis and duodenitis, without further malignant findings. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed preserved left ventricular function and a borderline increase of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure of 35 mmHg. Coronary angiography on the other hand revealed a 2-vessel coronary artery disease, with a 50% stenosis of the left main and mid right coronary artery. In this regard, absence of inducible myocardial ischemia was observed using cardiac dobutamine stress magnetic resonance tomography, and therefore PCI was not performed. In addition, a mild dilatation of the RV was noticed with baseline CMR images. During his hospital stay, however, the patient was found unconscious, centralized, and with apnoea, requiring immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation and admission to our intensive care unit. Echocardiographic examinations revealed akinetic ventricles without pericardial effusion and ECG showed pulseless electrical activity. The patient expired despite prolonged resuscitation. Postmortem autopsy revealed an unexpected diagnosis. Thus, histopathologic work-up showed a squamous cell carcinoma of the right ureter (apT4, apN3, apM1, V1, G2), which infiltrated the pelvis, corresponding vessels, and periurethral tissue and caused metastatic lesions in the vertebral body 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a)–2(c))</u>. In addition, massive embolization of cell conglomerates was observed in the pulmonary vessels causing haemorrhagic infarction of the pulmonary parenchyma 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u>.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Abdominal CT scan illustrating fibrotic, possibly infiltrative changes around the abdominal aorta .</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Squamous cell carcinoma manifestation in the ureteral wall. (b) Metastatic manifestation of the squamous cell carcinoma lesion in the vertebral body. (c) Tumour infiltration of periurethral fat tissue. (d) Pulmonary vessels with extensive squamous cell carcinoma tumour embolisms and haemorrhagic infarction of the pulmonary parenchyma.</u>\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Pulmonary tumour embolisms remain a rare and in most cases sudden cause of death. Unspecific presentation in symptoms of usually previously unknown primary tumours can prevent both diagnosis and effective treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Possible hypotheses explaining massive tumour cell embolization include infiltration of the veins with tumour cells, which subsequently enter the circulation causing embolism of the pulmonary arteries. Once such neoplastic cells have entered the pulmonary circulation, they may additionally induce the activation of the coagulation cascade. Therefore, an admixture of thrombus and tumour cells is usually present in such cases. In recent autopsy series, breast and liver tumours were associated with intravascular tumour, while cases of stomach, prostate, and lung carcinoma demonstrated such a mixed pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In addition to such intravascular obstructive mechanisms, mural changes resulting in pulmonary hypertension have also been described. Such mechanisms include medial hypertrophy of small arteries and arterioles, fibrointimal proliferation, intimal fibrosis, and disruption of the internal elastic lamina with endarteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In contrast to the classical thromboembolic disease, such proliferative and fibrotic changes usually lead to complete and irreversible occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 5\\]</u>. This may explain why “cor pulmonale” tends to develop earlier and right heart failure symptoms tend to be more severe with tumour embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. Table 1 gives an overview of so far reported tumour-related cases of pulmonary embolism .\n\n【10】Table 1 Overview of reported pulmonary tumour embolisms.\n\n【11】Of course the diagnostic work-up of such cases is challenging for the clinician, since no blood tests or imaging modalities are available for diagnosis. Thus, conventional clinical probability scores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> would have computed a score of 0 in our case, indicating a very low risk for pulmonary embolism. In addition, standardized blood tests such as measurement of D-dimers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> probably have low positive and negative predictive value, because baseline tumour activity may lead to false positive and the absence of thrombotic debris within the emboli to false negative results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Plain chest radiographs may be diagnostic in some cases if parenchymal abnormalities, such as fibrotic changes of the lungs, are present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In a case series by Kane et al. however, only one of eight patients has exhibited such parenchymal abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Computer tomography, on the other hand, has been used in only one study, where “multifocal dilatation and beading of peripheral pulmonary arteries” has been described in 3 cases of pulmonary tumour embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The utility of ventilation/perfusion scans to detect symmetric and peripherally localized defects has also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>. Pulmonary angiography, which is still considered as the invasive reference standard technique for the diagnosis of thrombotic embolism, exhibits low sensitivity for the detection of tumour embolisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. Aspiration cytology has also been discussed as a diagnostic alternative but may be difficult to implement in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【12】From a therapeutic point of view, fibrinolytic treatment seems ineffective. One case report has attempted this approach, without ultimate success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As presented in Table 1, some cases, notably atrial myxoma and kidney tumours, have survived due to immediate emergency surgery, which may be a promising alternative in haemodynamic stable patients.\n\n【13】In our case, we followed standard procedures of cardiopulmonary resuscitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However, our patient unfortunately expired before any diagnosis could be made. Retrospective review of echocardiographic and CMR findings of a borderline increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and mild RV dilatation may had been indicative of previous subclinical embolic events. Even though the definitive diagnosis of our case was set postmortem, having been aware of such pathologic findings beforehand would not have much changed our strategy. An interesting aspect of our case was the additional finding of retroperitoneal fibrotic changes on CT indicative of Ormond’s disease. However, retrospective histopathologic work-up showed that these changes were probably related to infiltrative activity of the squamous cell carcinoma, which infiltrated the ureteral wall, periurethral tissue, and probably also the abdominal aorta.\n\n【14】Pulmonary tumour embolisms continue to be clinically challenging in modern medicine. Patient presentation is unspecific and diagnostic options and therapy possibilities remain limited. Further studies are required to establish effective detection and treatment strategies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an airway hypersensitivity reaction to the fungus that is almost exclusively seen in patients with cystic fibrosis or asthma. Here, we present a case of ABPA in a patient with a history of chronic cocaine use and tuberculosis and no history of asthma or cystic fibrosis. The patient had presented with progressively worsening dyspnea for three months as well as a 20-pound weight loss. Diagnosis was made with an elevated IgE against Aspergillus and chest CT findings, which included bronchiectasis and tree-in-bud nodular opacities. The patient was treated with IV methylprednisolone followed by a 4-day course of oral prednisone, with significant improvement. It is our hope to make healthcare providers aware of the potential presence of ABPA in chronic cocaine users and patients with tuberculosis, both of which are not traditionally associated with this condition.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Aspergillosis refers to a spectrum of disorders that can occur due to colonization with the Aspergillus fungus. Spores are commonly airborne in the environment but only classically cause disease in immunocompromised patients. Aspergillus is unique in the fact that it can result in either infectious or atopic manifestations. Types of aspergillosis diseases include allergic Aspergillus sinusitis, aspergilloma, invasive aspergillosis, fungal asthma, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】ABPA is an airway hypersensitivity reaction to the fungus that is almost exclusively seen in patients with cystic fibrosis or asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The estimated prevalence of ABPA among patients with asthma is approximately 1–2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The prevalence is slightly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis, estimating about 2–9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In rare cases, ABPA can be seen in lung transplant recipients or those with bronchiectasis, chronic granulomatous disease, or hyper-IgE syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) provides a proposed set of diagnostic criteria for ABPA  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.These criteria are divided into three groupings: predisposing conditions, obligatory criteria, and other criteria. One of the following predisposing conditions must be present: asthma or cystic fibrosis. Both of the following obligatory criteria must be present: positive Aspergillus skin test or IgE levels against Aspergillus that are detectable and an elevated serum IgE concentration. At least 2 of the following “other criteria” must be present: precipitating Aspergillus serum antibodies, pulmonary opacities seen on chest radiograph, or a serum eosinophil count greater than 500 cells/microliter in patients who have not been on glucocorticoids.\n\n【6】Table 1 ISHAM criteria for diagnosis of ABPA.\n\n【7】Despite the requirement of one predisposing condition, ISHAM notes that a diagnosis of ABPA is still possible in patients without asthma or cystic fibrosis, albeit very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The objective of this case report is to highlight a rare case of ABPA in a patient with a history of chronic cocaine use and tuberculosis and no history of asthma or cystic fibrosis.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】This patient is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history of tuberculosis and a significant social history of chronic cocaine use who presented to the emergency department due to progressively worsening dyspnea over the last three months. On physical exam, the patient had diffuse wheezing. He also endorsed a 20-pound weight loss over the last three months and increased urinary retention. The patient denied fevers, chills, recent travel, hemoptysis, and cigarette smoking.\n\n【10】During his hospital stay, the following labs were performed: Acid-fast bacilli smear, Mycobacterium polymerase chain reaction, Legionella antigen, urine drug screen, immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, Aspergillus antigen, and neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody. Acid-fast bacilli testing was negative, as well as mycobacterium polymerase chain reaction, Legionella antigen, and neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine. Eosinophil count was elevated at 670 cells/μL (normal < 610 cells/μL). IgE level was also elevated at 2,378 kU/L (normal < 114 kU/L). Based on findings of elevated IgE levels, IgE against Aspergillus fumigatus was sought out and came back positive (0.56 kU/L).\n\n【11】Chest X-ray revealed hyperinflation, flattened diaphragm, and pleural thickening . Chest CT without contrast revealed some bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis in the bilateral lower lobes 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. In the right upper lobe, there was also some bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, and tree-in-bud nodularity 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. A 1.0 × 2.2 × 1.8 cm solid nodule was visualized in the posterior medial right lung 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. This was grossly stable in size from a chest CT 3 months prior.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Posterior-anterior chest X-ray revealing hyperinflation, flattened diaphragm, and pleural thickening.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Chest CT without contrast revealing (a) bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis in the bilateral lower lobes; (b) bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, and tree-in-bud nodularity; and (c) a 1.0 × 2.2 × 1.8 cm solid nodule in the posterior medial right lung.</u>\n\n【14】The patient was first treated at an outside hospital for pneumonia with amoxicillin-clavulanate and a 7-day course of prednisone 10 mg at the first onset of his symptoms. He reported transient improvement with steroids. On presentation, prior to confirmation of ABPA, the patient was treated with 60 mg intravenous methylprednisolone BID and inhaled ipratropium bromide with albuterol sulfate. Once ABPA was confirmed, the patient was transitioned from methylprednisolone to a 4-day treatment course with 60 mg oral prednisone. The patient noted significant improvement prior to discharge.\n\n【15】Given the concern for malignancy due to significant weight loss and urinary retention, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured. This was elevated at 11.2 ng/ml (normal < 4.0 ng/ml). Urology was consulted, and outpatient follow-up with urology was recommended for a transrectal ultrasound- (TRUS-) guided biopsy.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Aspergillosis refers to a spectrum of disorders that can occur due to colonization with a type of Aspergillus fungus, most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus. Spores are commonly airborne in the environment yet rarely cause disease in immunocompetent patients. On the other hand, immunocompromised patients are at risk of various presentations of disease due to inhalation of the fungus. Aspergillus is unique in the fact that it can result in either infectious or atopic manifestations. Types of aspergillosis infections include allergic Aspergillus sinusitis, aspergilloma, invasive aspergillosis, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Allergic Aspergillus sinusitis (AAS) is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus that results in sinusitis. The reaction is similar to that of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; however, it occurs in the sinuses. Despite the similar mechanism of colonization, few cases report simultaneous presence of both diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Patients at risk for developing AAS include those with a prior sensitization to the Aspergillus antigen who also have a past medical history of asthma or rhinosinusitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】An aspergilloma is an intracavitary fungus ball that typically presents in previously colonized areas of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. For this reason, many patients may have a history of colonization with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion with a thickened wall. In most instances, this is an incidental finding, and patients remain asymptomatic. Rarely, patients can present with hemoptysis secondary to blood vessel invasion. Aspergillus sensitization has also been commonly reported in the setting of pulmonary tuberculosis cavitary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Dhooria et al. reported that 16% of patients with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis had Aspergillus sensitization. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of tuberculosis is not a “predisposing condition” in the ISHAM criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Invasive aspergillosis refers to systemic dissemination of the fungus. Normally, alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells work together to rid the lungs of infection before dissemination can occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In cases where this is inefficient, the fungi are able to latch onto blood vessels, invade the endothelium, and spread throughout the body. Risk factors for invasive aspergillosis include severe neutropenia, glucocorticoids given in high doses, AIDS, and immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Once the fungus becomes systemic, it can affect almost every organ, including the liver, kidneys, eyes, and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to the Aspergillus fungus, similar to AAS. However, this reaction occurs in the airways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. ABPA is almost exclusively seen in patients with cystic fibrosis or asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The estimated prevalence of ABPA among patients with asthma is approximately 1–2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The prevalence is slightly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis, estimating about 2–9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In rare cases, ABPA can be seen in lung transplant recipients or those with bronchiectasis, chronic granulomatous disease, or hyper-IgE syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Diagnosis of ABPA is often made using the ISHAM criteria  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This patient presented with both “obligatory criteria” (elevated serum IgE concentration and elevated IgE levels against Aspergillus fumigatus). He also met two of the “other criteria” (tree-in-bud nodularity and bronchiectasis and total eosinophil count > 500 cells/μL). This case is unique in that the patient did not have any of the predisposing conditions. ISHAM notes that a diagnosis of ABPA can still be made despite not presenting with these conditions although this is rare.\n\n【23】ABPA is characterized by mucoid bronchial obstruction, resulting in wheezing and rhonchi. Given the background of hypersensitivity in this disease, patients typically have associated eosinophilia and eosinophilic pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Despite the severity of Aspergillus colonization, the fungi do not invade bronchial walls. In most cases, the presence of fungal spores in the lungs results in the formation of IgG and IgA against the antigens. These are sufficient enough to clear the Aspergillus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In patients with a history of atopy, additional IgE antibodies also form, manifesting as the hypersensitivity reaction of ABPA.\n\n【24】Similar to the pathogenesis of asthma, CD4+ helper T cells also play a role in the development of ABPA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. When exposed to fungus, helper T cells secrete interleukins (IL), which include IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In response to the interleukins, the body produces IgE and eosinophils, contributing even more so to the common finding of eosinophilia. Mucus plugs contain Charcot–Leyden crystals and eosinophils. Culture of these plugs may or may not grow the Aspergillus fungus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Chronic airway hyperreactivity due to ABPA can result in the development of bronchiectasis. Chest radiographs often reveal thickened bronchial walls and atelectasis secondary to mucoid plugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Initial pulmonary function testing presents with an obstructive pattern of changes, including an increased residual volume (RV) and a decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Recommended treatment focuses on controlling inflammation and is usually a taper of systemic glucocorticoids over three to six months.\n\n【26】ABPA is rarely reported in patients without asthma or cystic fibrosis. This patient is unique in that he did not meet the ISHAM predisposing conditions usually required for diagnosis of ABPA. It is important to note that this is a single case of such association, which does not warrant enough evidence to claim that chronic cocaine use and previously treated tuberculosis increase risk for ABPA. Nevertheless, it is our hope to make healthcare providers aware of its potential presence in chronic cocaine users and patients with tuberculosis, both of which are not traditionally associated with this condition.\n\n【27】#### Disclosure\n\n【28】This case report was presented at the 2019 University of South Florida Health Research Day on February 22, 2019.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

A 72-year-old woman was diagnosed as having primary lung cancer (cT1N0M0 stage IA) in the right upper lobe and was treated with SBRT of 48 Gy in 4 fractions. After 12 months, mass-like consolidation appeared around the irradiated area, and after 13 months, it had increased in size. FDG-PET revealed high uptake (SUV m a x \\= 5 . 6 1 ) for the consolidation. CT-guided biopsy was performed, but we could not confirm the diagnosis. Considering her poor respiratory function and her age, short-interval follow-up was performed. After 15 months, the consolidation enlarged at the dorsal side, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) became elevated (14.6 ng/mL). Serum KL-6 (436 U/mL) and SP-D (204 ng/mL) were also elevated. However, after 16 months, serum CEA slightly decreased. The consolidation gradually retracted on follow-up CT images. CEA, KL-6, and SP-D were also decreased by degrees. After 40 months, there is no evidence of local recurrence.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an effective therapy for early-stage lung cancer. In some cases after SBRT, dense consolidation is observed over or around the tumors on follow-up computed tomography (CT). Sometimes, it appears as mass-like consolidation, in which case it is difficult to distinguish radiation fibrosis from local recurrence, though it is important from a clinical point of view to make this distinction.\n\n【4】We experienced a case of radiation fibrosis appearing as mass-like consolidation with elevation of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which was difficult to distinguish from local recurrence. In this paper, we present this case along with a review of the literature.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 72-year-old woman was diagnosed as having primary lung cancer (cT1N0M0 stageⅠA) of the right upper lobe . Because her respiratory function was not sufficient for her to undergo surgical resection, she was treated with SBRT. Irradiation was performed with a 4-MV and 10-MV linear accelerator. Forty-eight Gy in 4 fractions was prescribed at the isocenter with multiple static ports. The isodose distribution of SBRT is shown in Figure 2. Serum CEA was elevated to 14.7 n/mL, but serum KL-6 (230 U/mL) and SP-D (72.8 ng/mL) were not elevated before SBRT.

On CT images 2 months after treatment, irregularly shaped patchy consolidation, which was considered radiation pneumonitis, appeared in the irradiated field 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. After 6 and 9 months, the patchy consolidation was retracted, which was considered to be typical radiation fibrosis 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(b), 3(c))</u>, and serum CEA gradually decreased. However, after 12 months, mass-like consolidation appeared around the irradiated area 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(d))</u>, and after 13 months, it had increased in size. Because ecstatic air-containing bronchi were not observed within the consolidation, and the 3b branch of the right lung was displaced on CT images, the possibility of local recurrence was considered. At this time, serum CEA, KL-6, and SP-D were not elevated compared with the previous values. FDG-PET revealed high uptake (SUV m a x \\= 5 . 6 1 ) for the consolidation . CT-guided biopsy was performed. The result of cytology was class II, and histologically cancer cells were not detected.

Discussion\n\n【16】On CT images, parenchymal consolidation with a straight lateral margin and air bronchograms is typical for radiation fibrosis, whereas a homogeneous opacity without air bronchograms and with a convex border is strongly suggestive of recurrent tumor in the irradiated lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In addition, the filling in of bronchi within radiation fibrosis is abnormal and usually represents local recurrent malignancy or a superimposed infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Koenig et al. firstly described as mass-like radiation fibrosis related to 3-D conformal radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Mass-like radiation fibrosis in their cases was accompanied by volume loss and bronchiectasis. However, in our case, neither volume loss nor bronchiectasis was observed at the presence of mass-like consolidation. Therefore, it was difficult to differentially diagnose this mass-like consolidation as radiation fibrosis from local recurrence. Aoki et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported patchy consolidation or discrete consolidation in 74% of cases during the first 6 months after SBRT. In SBRT, the shape of the dose distribution with a lower dose tended to become large and irregular, while a higher dose could be concentrated uniformly on the tumor. Matsuo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported that mass-like consolidation appeared in 27 (68%) of 40 tumors treated with SBRT. Of these 27 mass-like consolidations, 24 were radiation-induced lung injuries (RILI) and 3 were local recurrences. According to the previous reports mentioned above, it is not uncommon for mass-like consolidation to appear after SBRT. In conventional radiation therapy, the shape of the dose distribution of irradiated lungs is simple, and the boundary between the nonirradiated and irradiated lung is usually distinct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In contrast, in SBRT, multiple non coplanar portals with various directions were used. And the dose distribution usually has a 3-D shape and concentrates around the tumor. Therefore, radiation fibrosis after SBRT can appear in a 3-D shape, and is sometimes observed as mass-like lesions. In our case, also, the consolidation after SBRT had a 3-D shape, and was observed in approximately 50% or more of the isodose area.\n\n【17】Matsuo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> also reported that mass-like consolidations appeared at a median of 5 months (range, 2 to 9 months) after SBRT. The time to the appearance of the mass-like consolidations after SBRT was 2 to 9 months (median, 5 months) in RILI cases and 4 to 7 months (median, 7 months) in local recurrence cases. There was no significant difference in the time to appearance between RILI and local recurrence. According to their report, the size of the mass-like consolidations did not increase in any RILI cases after 12 months or later. In our case, however, the mass-like consolidation appeared at 12 months after SBRT, and had increased in size at 13 months. Radiation fibrosis can appear as mass-like consolidation even 12 months or more after the completion of SBRT.\n\n【18】In our case, serum CEA was also elevated in addition to the mass-like consolidation. The CEA elevation and the late appearance of the mass-like consolidation made it very difficult to differentially diagnose this condition as RILI from local recurrence. Several authors have reported that CEA elevation is observed in patients with various pulmonary inflammations such as acute pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, especially in cases with mucoid impaction, and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>. In our case, after 31 months, transient and slight re-elevation of serum CEA was seen, accompanied by the elevation of serum KL-6 and SP-D. CT examination at this time revealed minimal lung opacities, suggesting the presence of pneumonia in the left lower lobe, but no significant change in the irradiated area. This finding also suggested that the transient CEA elevation after SBRT was related to inflammatory changes of the lung in this case. The serum CEA level of smokers has been reported to be higher than that of nonsmokers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. CEA secretion from pulmonary epithelial cells has been considered to be influenced by smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This patient was a heavy smoker, and serum CEA did not decrease to its normal level after SBRT. The elevation of the serum CEA level before SBRT may have been caused not only by the tumor but also by heavy smoking.\n\n【19】Serum KL-6 and SP-D are useful serum markers of inflammatory lung diseases, typically interstitial pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. It has also been reported that KL-6 and SP-D can become elevated in some cases of adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In our case, however, serum KL-6 and SP-D levels were not elevated before SBRT. Also, serial changes of these serum marker levels were almost synchronous with the radiological change of the consolidation after SBRT and that following pneumonia in the left lower lung. Therefore, the changes in the serum KL-6 and SP-D levels after SBRT were considered to reflect the severity of the pulmonary inflammation rather than the progression of cancer.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】We experienced a case of radiation fibrosis appearing as mass-like consolidation after SBRT with the elevation of serum CEA, which was difficult to distinguish from local recurrence. If it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis by further examination including FDG-PET and histological examination, short-interval follow-up should be recommended.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Other than significant smoking history, the patient had been healthy with a recently treated case of uncomplicated pneumonia. The mass originated in the aortopulmonary window of the left mediastinum and invaded proximally into the left superior pulmonary vein and subsequently into the left atrium. The mass protrusion into the mitral valve occupied 50% of the left atrium space but showed no clinical symptoms of a valvular blockade. Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was identified upon biopsy. These findings of a primary lung tumor with atrial extension in an asymptomatic patient point to the importance of age-appropriate screening and standardization treatment modalities.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The evaluation of cardiac masses frequently presents diagnostic challenges due to a combination of their broad differential, imaging challenges, and rarity, with a prevalence of 0.001 to 0.03% of primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, and a 20–40 higher incidence of secondary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. When the tumor is an extension of lung cancer, there is no standardized approach to its management. Still, typically surgical resection is more common if there exists an intra-atrial extension of tumor thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We present a case of a rare presentation of lung cancer in an asymptomatic healthy female patient found to have a tumor thrombus originating in the pulmonary veins and extending into the left atrium.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient is a 67-year-old previously healthy female with a 55 pack-year smoking history presented with an indication of a mediastinal mass that was incidentally found on a chest radiograph when she developed pneumonia that resolved without complications several months prior. She denied any weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats. After 30 years of not being seen by a healthcare provider, she subsequently established with a primary care physician. At that time, age-appropriate cancer screening was initiated, including a low-dose CT (computed tomography) scan of the thorax, which identified a 19 × 21 mm nodule, left hilar lymphadenopathy, and intralobular septal thickening in the left upper lobe  suspicious for pulmonary venous obstruction.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Screening chest CT scan that originally identified the 19 × 22 mm nodule in the left upper lobe of the lung (red circle). Left hilar adenopathy was also noted on presentation (yellow circle). Intralobular septal thickening was also noted.</u>\n\n【7】On direct admission to the hospital for further workup of the pulmonary mass, the patient was hemodynamically stable during the admission with stable vitals and moderate hypertension of 150/90 mmHg. CT Thorax with contrast verified a mass in the aortopulmonary window measuring 3.3 × 2.4 cm 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u> and extending proximally into the left superior pulmonary veins and subsequently the left atrium 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 61% with a 3.0 cm × 1.6 cm mobile echo density with a poorly defined variegated surface visualized in the left atrium attached to the roof of the atrium . The hypoechoic mass moves slightly with the cardiac cycle but remains within the left atrium. The mass appears to be projecting in from the right pulmonary vein but is not clearly defined. In some echocardiographic views, the mass occupies more than 50% of the left atrium and has an undulating thrombus on the surface of the tumor.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CT thorax with contrast sagittal (a) and coronal (b) representative views of the patient’s mass measuring 3.3 × 2.4 cm.

An adrenal mass was incidentally found on CT abdomen and follow-up MRI abdomen with contrast established; it was a benign adrenal adenoma. Clinically, the patient appeared healthy and did not have any symptoms or imaging findings suggestive of metastatic disease. The patient reported no weight loss, fevers, chills, changes in appetite, chest pain, or SOB. The patient’s complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic profile (BMP) were unremarkable, except for mild hypokalemia of 3.2. A multidisciplinary approach was utilized: neurology for assessing anticoagulation and stroke prevention due to tumor thrombus involvement: thoracic/cardiac surgery for surgical evaluation; pulmonary for tumor evaluation and management; and interventional radiology for sample biopsy. Interventional radiology CT-guided percutaneous biopsy obtained a pathology sample of the left hilar mass that was identified as a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor cells had an immune profile that was supportive of thymic origins with positive staining for cytokeratin ae1/ae3, CAM5.2, p63, CD5 (patchy), CD117 (focal and patchy), and negative staining for PAX-8, napsin, TTF-1, CK7, CK20, S100, synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CDX-2 .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Histological sections of the left hilar mass.

This immunoprofile is supportive of a thymic origin and was diagnosed as poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. There were not enough tissues to perform ancillary molecular studies.</u>\n\n【12】After discussing with multiple disciplines (radiation, medical oncology, and surgery teams), the plan was to initiate inpatient chemotherapy with concurrent radiation therapy. The patient was transferred to the oncology inpatient service for further management. Her final staging was T4N3M0, Stage 3C. Evaluation by the surgical specialties deemed the tumor to be nonresectable due to location and complexity. As such, following the data obtained from the Pacific trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, the patient was subsequently started on 6000 cGy radiation with concurrent turbotaxol and subsequently followed up with one year of durvalumab. On patient follow-up visits two months after initiating therapy, she is tolerating treatments with minimal adverse effects. Follow-up CT thorax demonstrates a decreased lung mass down to 16mm × 8mm (from 19 × 22 mm).\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】The most common causes of intracardiac tumors are hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Urgent evaluation and complete staging are essential aspects of management with cardiac CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the most commonly used methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the case of our patient, the workup was all negative. Ultimately a biopsy was obtained, which determined the mass as a Stage IIIC squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with possible thymic origins. What makes this case unique is the asymptomatic presentation of a sizeable nonobstructive mass in an otherwise healthy female patient of relatively young age compared to previous case reports with typical age ranging from the mid-70s to mid-80s.\n\n【15】Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and is responsible for most cancer-related deaths in the US and worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Lung cancer invasion into the heart is a rare phenomenon, with only a few reported cases worldwide in the last decade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 7–10\\]</u>. Most of these cases present with symptomatic patients to varying degrees, from the potential of embolization causing stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, bowel infarction, and ischemic leg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> to the left ventricular outlet obstruction resulting in sudden death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. There is still no standardized approach to such masses given these devastating complications, although surgery before chemotherapy is generally advocated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In our case, a healthy female patient in her mid-60s presented with an asymptomatic mediastinal mass and a mobile echo density in the left atrium. On TTE, the mass is fairly large with a poorly defined structure, unlike cardiac myxomas. Our initial differential was broad and included anatomical variations, implantable devices, thrombus, vegetations or other infectious etiologies, traumatic scar (patient had a car accident history), artifacts, and tumors. Among tumors, lung cancer has the highest incidence of metastasis to the heart, followed by breast cancer, malignant melanoma, leukemia, and malignant lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. Additionally, on the differential were myxomas, fibromas, and rhabdomyomas. Due to the tumor’s extension, we also suspected sarcoma as a malignant tumor source. Lastly, metastatic workup included CT, MRI, and NM bone scans returned negative; the diagnosis ultimately depended on the biopsy result. A biopsy of the left hilar mass was obtained with the help of interventional radiology, and subsequent staining was completed.\n\n【17】Due to the number of possible complications that can arise from the mass and its associated treatment, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to identify and classify the tumor and its subsequent therapy steps. The tumor was classified as T4N3M0, Stage IIIC, due to the lack of distant metastasis. The thymic origins suggested possible lymphoma, but after reviewing the histological slides, the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or NSCLC was made, and treatment was planned accordingly. Under the current NCCN guidelines, the patient was treated with chemoradiation per the Pacific trials and will be evaluated for surgical candidacy in the future. At the time of this manuscript submission, the patient is doing well and is tolerating her treatments. Tumor shrinkage was noted on chest CT after two months of therapy. This presentation helps to signify the importance of age-appropriate lung cancer screening with low-dose CT in those with significant smoking history, which recently has been shown to have evidence-based mortality reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】Lung cancer with tumor thrombus can be a rare and severe complication with involvement of the left atrium. Especially with debilitating complications like stroke and infarction, it becomes prudent for age-appropriate screening and early detection of these tumors. The prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung presenting as tumor thrombus in the left atrium is a rarity. Therefore, we need further studies to learn about more multidisciplinary team management strategies and treating such masses. Here, we report a case of an asymptomatic left atrial invasion from squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Despite such symptoms that overlap with those of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the diagnostic criteria for SLE were not fulfilled. Due to positive results for human parvovirus B19 (HPV-B19) IgM antibodies in the serum, diagnoses of HPV-B19 infection were made in both cases. Although acetaminophen failed to improve their deteriorating symptoms, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), loxoprofen, completely removed the symptoms immediately after the administration. In those cases, since the patients were predisposed to atopic disorders, an increased immunological response based on the lymphocyte hypersensitivity was likely to be involved in the pathogenesis. The immunomodulatory property of NSAID was thought to repress such lymphocyte activity and thus provided a rapid and sustained remission of the disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The classic symptoms of human parvovirus B19 (HPV-B19) infection include fever, rash, arthralgia, and edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In children, the symptoms are usually self-limited, resolving spontaneously within a few weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In adults, however, they are often prolonged, sometimes causing serious complications, such as chronic arthritis, myocarditis, and meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>, or triggering the onset of autoimmune diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. According to previous studies, the direct cytotoxicity of the virus has been ascribed to the pathogenesis of the symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. However, due to the absence of drugs that are effective for the virus, there is no causal treatment. To relieve the symptoms, analgesics or antipyretics are generally used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, although they do not shorten the duration of the disease. Here, we experienced two cases of HPV-B19 infection in adult patients with past histories of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis. In those cases, due to the atopic predispositions of the patients, an increased immunological response was more likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of the symptoms. In such cases, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), loxoprofen, dramatically improved their deteriorating symptoms immediately after the administration. The immunomodulatory property of this drug was thought to repress the lymphocyte activity, and thus provided a rapid and sustained remission of the disease.\n\n【4】#### 2\\.

Five days prior to her visit, she had upper respiratory symptoms and a low grade fever . Oral administration of 400 mg acetaminophen relieved those symptoms. Then, however, she developed a butterfly-shaped erythema on her face and swelling of her fingers. Three days later, although the facial erythema had improved, she developed joint pain in her fingers, wrists, shoulders, and knees, for which acetaminophen did not work. On physical examination, the patient looked tired. Her body temperature was 36.7°C, blood pressure was 94/50 mmHg, and pulse rate was 61 beats/min. She weighed 48 kg and was 153 cm tall. She had no rash except for a malar erythema that was faint at that time. All her fingers were swollen, but her wrist, shoulder, and knee joints were not. Both her legs had pretibial pitting edema. Laboratory data showed mild hypoproteinemia (serum protein 6.4 g/dL) and slightly decreased peripheral white blood cell count (4,100/μL). However, other hematologic parameters were relatively normal (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit 35.2%, reticulocyte 1.4%, and platelet count 230,000/μL). Liver enzymes and C-reactive protein levels were not elevated. Regardless of hypocomplementemia (C3 72 mg/dL, C4 9 mg/dL, and CH50 18.6 U/mL), the tests for serum antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Although　the IgG antibody was not examined, a positive result for HPV-B19 IgM antibody (index 7.97) indicated a recent infection of the virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Since microbiological tests for other viruses, such as measles and rubella, were negative, a diagnosis of HPV-B19 infection was finally made. Because her symptoms deteriorated despite the use of acetaminophen, oral administration of loxoprofen (180 mg/day) was alternatively started immediately after the diagnosis . The symptoms, including facial erythema, polyarthralgia, and the swelling of her fingers, rapidly disappeared within 12 hours after the initiation of the drug.

Ten days prior to her visit, she had a low grade fever  when her 9-year-old son was diagnosed as having erythema infectiosum because of his slapped cheek rash. Seven days later, she developed a butterfly-shaped erythema transiently on her face that disappeared the next day. Then, she developed swelling of her fingers and joint pain in her shoulders, ankles, and knees. Since oral administration of acetaminophen did not relieve her symptoms, she came to our clinic. On physical examination, the patient looked tired. Her body temperature was 37.0°C, blood pressure was 110/72 mmHg, and pulse rate was 66 beats/min. She weighed 52 kg and was 160 cm tall. At that time, she presented no malar erythema and no rash in her body. Although all her fingers were swollen, the swelling of her shoulder, ankle, and knee joints was not obvious.

Discussion\n\n【12】Skin rashes and arthralgia are the most common clinical features in adult patients with HPV-B19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Previous studies have ascribed the pathogenesis of the symptoms to the direct cytotoxicity of the virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In our cases, however, it was less likely involved, because both patients developed the symptoms in the absence of reticulocytopenia or thrombocytopenia that usually coincides with viremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Although their clinical and laboratory features did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, their SLE-like features, including butterfly-shaped erythema and polyarthralgia, strongly suggested an increased immunological response. In addition, hypocomplementemia in Case  1, which occurs in both SLE and HPV-B19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>, indicated the activation of the classical complement pathway caused by the increase in immune complexes. Therefore, in our cases, such enhanced immunity was more likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of the symptoms. According to previous studies, patients with atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis are prone to develop autoimmune diseases due to the hypersensitivity of T-helper 2 lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u> or the dysregulated activity of B-lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In our cases, since both patients were predisposed to atopic disorders, such as atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, the HPV-B19 infection may have triggered the activity of the lymphocytes.\n\n【13】For adult patients with HPV-B19 infection, NSAIDs are often used to provide symptomatic relief for arthralgia and myalgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 18\\]</u>. However, since these drugs do not shorten the duration of the disease, the patients have to wait at least 1 to 2 weeks for the spontaneous remission of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. In our cases, although acetaminophen failed to ameliorate the patients’ symptoms, loxoprofen completely removed their deteriorating symptoms quickly after the administration . Therefore, in our cases, loxoprofen was thought to be responsible for the complete remission of the disease. NSAIDs are the most commonly used anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic drugs. Additionally, due to their immunomodulatory properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>, they have also been used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> and rheumatoid arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Studies have revealed that NSAIDs inhibit the migration of leukocytes or their cytokine production, either cyclooxygenase (COX) dependently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> or independently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>, and thus exert immunomodulatory effects. In the present cases, since the increased activity of lymphocytes was mainly involved in the pathogenesis, the immunomodulation by the NSAID was thought to be responsible for the rapid removal of the symptoms and the complete remission of the disease. Recently, we have demonstrated in a basic study that NSAIDs repress the activity of lymphocytes by the functional inhibition of delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup>\\-channels (Kv1.3) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Since T-lymphocytes highly express the channels in their plasma membranes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>, such mechanism may have greatly contributed to the immunomodulatory effect of NSAID in our patients. In this regard, besides the short-term use of immunosuppressive agents or steroids, the use of selective Kv1.3-channel blockers may also be useful. The early administration of such drugs would not only shorten the duration of the disease, but also prevent the serious complications caused by HPV-B19 infection or the onset of autoimmune diseases triggered by the virus.\n\n【14】In summary, this is the first report of HPV-B19 infection in adult patients with atopic predispositions showing the usefulness of NSAID for the quick removal of the symptoms. The immunomodulatory property of NSAID was thought to repress the increased lymphocyte activity and thus provided a rapid and sustained remission of the disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

There were no clinical or laboratory features of primary vasculitis or connective tissue disease, Doppler imaging was normal, and bloods were unremarkable aside from a platelet count of 786 × 109/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(150–400)</u> and white cells of 16 × 109/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(4–11)</u>. In view of the thrombocytosis a JAK2 mutation assay was requested which confirmed a JAK2 V617F mutation, suggesting essential thrombocytosis (ET) as the cause. She received treatment with hydroxycarbamide which normalised her platelet count and led to a complete resolution of her Raynaud’s symptoms. Raynaud’s phenomenon is a rare manifestation of ET. Myeloproliferative disorders such as ET should be considered in the differential diagnosis of Raynaud’s phenomenon and vasculitis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Raynaud’s phenomenon is a common symptom encountered by general practitioners and hospital doctors. It is commonly a primary disorder but can be secondary to other conditions. Whilst the underlying cause in this case was unusual it emphasizes the importance of considering secondary causes which may not have an autoimmune aetiology.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 59-year-old was referred to the rheumatology clinic for investigation of possible vasculitis. She had a two-week history of pain and discolouration of her left second and third toes preceded by six months of Raynaud’s phenomenon affecting her fingers and toes. She experienced several attacks of Raynaud’s each day often triggered by cold. She was otherwise well with no symptoms to suggest an underlying connective tissue disease and no past medical history of note. She had recently stopped smoking, having previously smoked 20 cigarettes daily for more than 20 years.\n\n【6】On examination she was apyrexial with ischaemic lesions on 2nd and 3rd toes . Peripheral pulses were normal and systemic examination was unremarkable. Urinalysis was negative.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Left foot of a 59-year-old patient presenting to rheumatology clinic.</u>\n\n【8】Investigations revealed haemoglobin of 146 g/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(115–165)</u>, platelet count of 786 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(150–400)</u>, and white cells of 16 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(4–11)</u>. White cell differential showed a lymphocyte count of 3.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (1.5–4.5), neutrophil count of 10.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (1.7–7.5), monocytes of 1.2 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (0.2–0.8), eosinophils of 0.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (0–0.4), and basophils of 0.2 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (0–0.1). Liver, renal, and thyroid functions were normal as were CRP, immunoglobulins, complement levels, and Doppler imaging of the lower limbs. ANA, ANCA, and rheumatoid factors were negative.\n\n【9】In view of the thrombocytosis, a JAK2 mutation assay was performed. This confirmed a JAK2 V617F mutation suggesting essential thrombocytosis (ET) as the cause.\n\n【10】Initially treatment was directed at improving peripheral blood flow and pain control. This included oral nifedipine, aspirin, and intravenous iloprost. Opiates were required for pain relief. Despite these measures the toe failed to improve and the Raynaud’s symptoms continued.\n\n【11】Following the diagnosis of ET treatment with hydroxycarbamide was commenced. Treatment with hydroxycarbamide normalised the platelet count within three months and led to complete resolution of the Raynaud’s symptoms and healing of the ischaemic lesions.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】ET is an uncommon myeloproliferative disease with an estimated incidence of 0.4–2.5 per 100,000 per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A typical patient is female and diagnosed in the 5th or 6th decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The JAK2 V617F mutation is identified in 50–60% of cases of ET 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Patients with ET may present with haemorrhagic complications, due to platelet dysfunction, or thrombotic disorders including stroke, coronary artery ischaemia, deep vein thrombosis, and digital ischaemia. Thrombotic events occur more frequently in patients with ET who are positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The platelet count is often elevated above 1000 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L although studies suggest a median level of around 800 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Lower levels are not unusual and may be attributed to inflammation or tissue necrosis.\n\n【15】Our patient presented with the triphasic white, blue, and red colour change of Raynaud’s and features of digital ischaemia. It is more common for patients to present with erythromelalgia (EM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. EM is characterised by redness and painful burning of the extremities with symptoms aggravated by heat or exercise and relieved by cold. In a retrospective study of 268 ET patients, 15 had features of EM, but Raynaud’s phenomenon was only observed in 1 patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The underlying pathology of EM is thought to be occlusion of the microcirculation by platelets, which is also likely to be a factor in ET associated Raynaud’s.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】Myeloproliferative disorders such as ET should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vasculitis and secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon. Investigation of suspected secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon should include full blood count, renal function, urinalysis, immunoglobulins, ANA, and ANCA.

Findings on ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI) led to a presumptive diagnosis of a 1.5 cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the right posterior lobe of the liver. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation of the tumor were attempted. After 2 months, CT scan and EOB-MRI showed that the tumor had enlarged to 3 cm. Positron emission tomography (PET) confirmed abnormal metabolic activity with a high standardized uptake value of 7.3 in the lesion. These findings could indicate malignancy such as well-differentiated HCC or cholangiocarcinoma or a benign lesion such as hepatic abscess. Histopathological examination of a liver biopsy revealed a granuloma with many inflammatory cells, leading to a diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. We report a rare case of hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor with enhancement on EOB-MRI and increased uptake on PET, mimicking HCC.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) is a rare benign tumor that may develop in various organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, IPT of the liver is very rare and is often accompanied by fever, malaise, and abdominal pain. Due to the lack of characteristic clinical and radiological features for diagnosis, IPT may be mistaken as malignant tumor such as cholangiocarcinoma, or liver abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In particular, IPT may be a vascular-rich tumor demonstrating radiological findings similar to those of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In a patient with risk factors for HCC, such as chronic viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, the presence of IPT may be misdiagnosed as HCC, and a correct diagnosis is established only by biopsy or surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. This lesion is usually diagnosed clinically or by conventional imaging methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Clinical diagnosis is difficult in patients with nonspecific symptoms and no serological evidence of inflammation. Laparoscopy and/or open hepatectomy are often performed unnecessarily under a misdiagnosis of HCC or cholangiocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Hence, diagnosis of IPT by percutaneous needle biopsy is important to avoid unnecessary exploratory laparotomy or hepatectomy. Unfortunately, needle biopsy does not always rule out malignancy or provide a definitive diagnosis of IPT of the liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. There are a few reports of hepatic IPT diagnosed by fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We herein report a case of IPT of the liver in a patient with cirrhosis, with imaging features mimicking HCC.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 71-year-old Japanese man was referred to our out-patient clinic in 2012 for investigation of a 1.5-cm liver mass and adenomyomatosis of gallbladder, which were detected incidentally by ultrasonography (US).\n\n【7】The patient had no history of medication. Physical examination was normal. No stigmata for chronic liver disease was identified. Superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. The lungs were normal on auscultation. A chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram were normal. The results of biochemical analysis of the blood were total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.2–1.2); direct bilirubin, 0.1 mg/dL (normal range: 0.0–0.2); aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 45 IU/L (normal range: 10–40); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 50 IU/L (normal range: 5–45); alkaline phosphatase, 419 IU/L (normal range: 100–325); γ\\-guanosine triphosphate, 242 IU/L (normal range: <30), CEA, 4.1 ng/mL (normal range: <5.0); CA19-9, 23.2 U/mL (normal range: <37.0); alpha fetoprotein (AFP), 11.3 ng/mL (normal range: <10.0); protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonists-II (PIVKA-II), 11 ng/mL (normal range: <10.0). His daily alcohol intake was over 80 g for 40 years. Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e-antigen, and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative.\n\n【8】Ultrasonography reviewed a lesion in the liver, which was isoechoic to surrounding parenchyma. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 1.5-cm mass in the right posterior lobe of the liver, with contrast enhancement in early phase and washout with rim enhancement in delayed phase, together with definite findings of cirrhosis such as loss of hepatic volume or hypertrophy of the left liver and caudate lobe. The imaging findings thus indicate cirrhosis with IPT. The etiology might be alcoholic liver injury judging from his alcohol intake (over 80 g daily for 40 years). In MRI examination, the tumor was isodense on T1-weighted image and partially round and hyperintense on T2-weighted image. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (EOB-MRI) was performed. In the arterial phase following contrast injection, the center of the tumor was enhanced intensely and homogeneously. In the delayed phase and hepatobiliary phase, the tumor was completely washed out , similar to findings in malignant tumors. It was difficult or impossible to differentiate IPT from HCC on EOB-MRI. The mass was clinically diagnosed as an HCC according to the 2008 guidelines of Japanese Society of Hepatology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. We attempted transcatheter arterial infusion of iopamiron and observed nodules in the right posterior lobe of the liver . We next attempted transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with lipiodol (2 mL) plus epirubicin (20 mg) and miriplatin (70 mg) plus lipiodol (2 mL) plus porous gelatin particles (Gelpart). After TACE, partial lipiodol accumulation was observed. Moreover, we attempted radiofrequency ablation (RFA).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | MR images of hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor.

On EOB-MRI, the tumor was enhanced intensely and homogeneously in arterial phase and entirely hypointense in the delayed phase and hepatobiliary phase . An FDP-PET scan confirmed abnormal metabolic activity with a high standardized uptake value of 7.3 in the lesion. We attempted percutaneous needle biopsy to differentiate between HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, metastatic liver tumor, and liver abscess. Histologically, the tumor consisted of infiltrated inflammatory cells comprising lymphoplasma cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils in a background of stroma composed of interlacing bundles of myofibroblasts and collagen bundles 删除1:<u>(Figure 5(a))</u>.

Discussion\n\n【18】Certain bacteria including Escherichia coli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, Staphylococcus aureus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, and Gram-positive cocci 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> have been proposed as the causative agents of IPT of the liver. Based on the imaging findings, IPT is sometimes misdiagnosed as a malignant tumor such as HCC, cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) or metastatic liver cancer, or liver abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 14\\]</u>. It is important to diagnose IPT by liver biopsy because the tumor can be cured by medical treatments including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In the present case, liver biopsy of the hepatic mass showed extensive infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils as well as fibrosis, suggesting IPT. Therefore, we first treated the patient with antibiotics for one week.\n\n【19】The IPT in our case was histologically composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and fibroblastic cells. Someren 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> classified IPT of the liver into three types: (i) hyalinized sclerosing; (ii) xanthogranuloma; (iii) plasma cell granuloma subtypes. However, previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> showed that histological appearance did not correlate with the disease stage and that these various morphological features were observed to some extent simultaneously even in the same case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. It has been speculated that the differences between these histological subtypes might reflect varying disease processes or periods. However, the presence of neutrophils in IPT has not been described. Strictly speaking, therefore, the present case cannot be classified into any of the subtypes. Although the tumor in our case cannot be strictly diagnosed as classical IPT of the liver, it is consistent with the broad diagnostic criteria.\n\n【20】Recently, IPT can be classified pathologically into two types: fibrohistiocytic and lymphoplasmacytic, from IgG4-related disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Fibrohistiocytic IPT is characterized by xanthogranulomatous inflammation, multinucleated giant cells, and neutrophilic infiltration and occurs predominantly in the peripheral hepatic parenchyma as mass-forming lesion. In contrast, lymphoplasmacytic IPT shows diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and prominent eosinophilic infiltration and is found exclusively around the hepatic hilum. In addition, venous occlusion with little inflammation and cholangitis without periductal fibrosis are frequently observed in the fibrohistiocytic type, whereas obliterative phlebitis and cholangitis with periductal fibrosis are common features of the lymphoplasmacytic type. Interestingly, IgG4-positive plasma cells are significantly more numerous in the lymphoplasmacytic than fibrohistiocytic type. Immunohistochemically, our case showed IgG-negative plasma cells and may be classified into the fibrohistiocytic type.\n\n【21】In the present case, findings observed in the liver biopsy, especially the focal CD10 positivity and neutrophilic infiltration, may suggest changes secondary to previous treatment. Heat injuries by RFA involving adjacent organs and Glisson’s sheaths have been reported to cause complications such as cholecystitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In our case, hepatocellular damage from cirrhosis and RFA/TACE treatment might have given rise to the IPT or caused enlargement of the IPT.\n\n【22】In conclusion, this paper reports for the first time the EOB-MRI and FDP-PET findings of IPT of the liver, which is difficult to differentiate from malignant tumor. In addition, our case may be a rare case of enlargement of hepatic IPT induced by TACE or/and RFA. IPT should be suspected when treatment for a suspected liver lesion, whether it is HCC or abscess, does not produce expected response.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "ca2cf0d0-6112-4225-9e60-da177ec443cd", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Reoperation as a result of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) associated with cyst formation in an intracranial tumor resection cavity is a rare clinical condition. We report two cases of reoperation as a result of raised ICP associated with cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity, one arising after glioma resection and the other after meningioma resection. In both cases, a “valve”-like structure was noted intraoperatively in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity. Surgical resection of the “valve”-like structure led to slow regression over several months after the reoperation rather than to immediate disappearance of the cyst. Both cases illustrate that the “valve”-like structure formed in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity may be responsible for cyst formation. Surgical resection of it provides good long-term outcomes in such patients though short-term outcomes are unsatisfactory; we speculate that if the resection of the cortical tissue around the “valve”-like structure is enough wide, its return may be avoided.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is common in patients undergoing intracranial tumor resection. Reoperation as a result of raised ICP is an important prognostic factor, often resulting in a poor outcome. Raised ICP associated with intracranial tumor resection frequently arises as a result of hemorrhage in the tumor resection cavity, peritumoral cerebral contusion, cerebral edema, and/or hemorrhage at adjacent or remote sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In contrast, reoperation as a result of raised ICP secondary to cyst formation in an intracranial tumor resection cavity is a rare clinical condition. In a retrospective analysis of 4,782 patients with intracranial tumor undergoing surgical treatment at our hospital over the past 10 years, we identified 98 patients who underwent reoperation owing to high ICP, and two of them developed high ICP as a result of cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity. Herein, we report the two cases, one arising as a result of repeated cyst formation in the tumor cavity after resection of temporal lobe glioma and the other after resection of sphenoid ridge meningioma. We also discuss the potential mechanisms underlying cyst formation in the intracranial tumor resection cavity.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【6】A 44-year-old female patient with a 1-year history of paroxysmal dizziness presented with an exacerbation of dizziness and nausea for 5 days. Physical examination revealed that she had poor memory and computation abilities without other focal neurological signs. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her head revealed a large zone of slightly elongated T1 or shortened T2 signal in her right temporal lobe. After administration of contrast agent, the lesion showed patchy heterogeneous enhancement or ring enhancement 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u>. A diagnosis of glioma was considered preoperatively. Surgery was performed via a right frontotemporal approach. Intraoperatively, a pink-purple tumor was noted on the surface of the temporal lobe near the sylvian fissure. The tumor was closely attached to the dura mater, with a soft texture and a rich blood supply. Under an operation microscope, the tumor tissue located adjacent to the sylvian fissure was excised, and a 4 cm cortical incision (as shown in the elliptical area in Figure 1(a)) was made in the sylvian fissure. Further intraoperative exploration showed that the blood supply to the tumor was provided by small branches of the middle cerebral artery. After separating the tumor along the perisylvian region and severing its feeding arteries, the tumor was resected in a piecemeal fashion. The cortical tissue located on the surface of the temporal lobe was not resected (the extent of tumor resection was limited to the elliptical area shown in Figure 1(b)). Surgicel (Ethicon, Inc. a Johnson & Johnson company; Somerville, NJ) was applied to cover the operative field to prevent exudation. The surgery was uneventful, and no openings were found in the cerebral ventricle. Pathological examination demonstrated that the tumor was a grade III oligodendroastrocytoma. The patient recovered well after surgery.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Imaging results for Case 1 . (a) Contrast-enhanced MRI showing heterogeneous or ring-like enhancement in the temporal lobe.

(g) Disappearance of cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity 3 months after the second reoperation. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】However, 3 days after surgery, she developed somnolence, mydriasis (pupillary diameter of 4.0 mm), disappearance of the light reflex in her right eye, and left limb paralysis. She had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 7. The patient received 250 ml of 20% mannitol and 40 mg of furosemide immediately to lower ICP. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her head revealed a hypodense area in the tumor resection cavity in the right temporal lobe, which led to deformation and dislocation of the surrounding tissue and the cerebral ventricle. Therefore, cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity was indicated 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. Emergency exploratory surgery was then performed. After incising the dura mater, it was found that the cerebral tissue had an elevated tension. A “valve”-like structure was formed by relocated cerebral tissue, Surgicel, and the arachnoid in the roof region of the tumor cavity, sealing the effusion in the tumor resection cavity (the position of the “valve”-like structure is shown by the arrow in Figure 1(c)). After separating the arachnoid and removing the Surgicel to open the tumor resection cavity, approximately 40 ml of clear, nonyellow liquid was aspirated. As a response to tension reduction, the cerebral tissue collapsed. No communication between the tumor resection cavity and the cerebral ventricle was found. The tumor resection cavity was then washed repeatedly, and the bone flap was returned to its initial location. Postoperative CT reexamination revealed that the space-occupying effect was absent, the roof region of the tumor resection cavity was open, and the “valve”-like structure had disappeared (as shown by the arrow in Figure 1(d)).\n\n【9】Five days after the reoperation, the patient again developed symptoms of high ICP and cerebral hernia. Repeat CT showed a recommencement of effusion in the tumor resection cavity and resealing of the roof region of the tumor resection cavity, suggesting possible reformation of the “valve”-like structure 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(e))</u>. A second reoperation was performed to aspirate the effusion at which the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern were fully separated, the “valve”-like structure resected, and the relocated cortex marsupialized so that the tumor resection cavity could communicate with the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern and the effusion could enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation. Surgicel was not applied this time. Considering that the patient developed cerebral hernia after both operations, the bone flap was removed. The patient recovered well after the second reoperation.\n\n【10】One week later, a CT rescan of her head demonstrated that there was still effusion in the tumor resection cavity, and it was possible that the “valve”-like structure had reformed again 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(f))</u>. But because the compression on the surrounding tissue was not severe, and considering that the bone flap had been removed and radiotherapy had low risk, the patient was given Gamma Knife therapy immediately after discharge from hospital. Three months later, CT examination showed that the cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity had disappeared, and the tumor had not recurred 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(g))</u>.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【12】A 60-year-old women with a 2-month history of decreased memory presented with an exacerbation and nonfluent speech over the previous month. Physical examination revealed that she had incomplete motor aphasia without other focal neurological signs. An MRI scan of her head revealed a gourd-like area in the left frontotemporal region that spanned the anterior and middle cranial fossa. This abnormal area had a well-demarcated boundary, appearing as a slightly hypointense signal on the T1-weighted image, and as mixed isointense, slightly hyperintense and hypointense signals on the T2-weighted image. The left cerebral ventricle had become narrow as a result of compression. After contrast administration, the lesion showed heterogeneous enhancement 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>. A diagnosis of sphenoid ridge meningioma was considered preoperatively and surgery was performed via a left extended pterional approach. After opening the dura mater, it was found that the grooves of the cerebral cortex near the sylvian fissure had become shallow and showed a pale yellow color. Under an operation microscope, the sylvian fissure was separated, and the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus were retracted to expose the yellowish-white tumor. After partially separating the tumor along its periphery, it was found that the basal part of the tumor was located mainly in the sphenoid ridge and partly at the base of the anterior and middle cranial fossa. Blood supply to the tumor was provided by the small branches of the middle cerebral artery. After severing the feeding arteries, the tumor was totally resected in a piecemeal fashion. The basal dura mater was coagulated following surgery. After the tumor removal, Surgicel was applied to cover the tumor cavity. The surgery was uneventful. Pathological examination demonstrated that the tumor was a meningioma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Imaging results for Case 2 . (a)-(b) MRI showing sphenoid ridge meningioma.

However, her condition deteriorated 6 days after the operation. She developed somnolence, mydriasis of her left eye, right limb paralysis, and pathological reflex and had a GCS score of 7, suggesting the formation of a cerebral hernia. To lower ICP, the patient was given 250 ml of 20% mannitol immediately. An emergency CT scan of her head showed a patchy mixed density (mainly hypodensity) area in the tumor resection cavity adjacent to the temporal lobe. The ipsilateral cerebral ventricle was deformed as a result of compression, and the midline structure had shifted toward the right side, suggesting cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity. A band-shaped hyperintense shadow was noted in the intracranial subdural space, in which some shadows of gas density were scattered 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. Emergency exploratory surgery was performed. After removing a small epidural hematoma and incising the dura mater, it was found that a “valve”-like structure had formed by relocated cerebral tissue, Surgicel, and the arachnoid. The location of the “valve”-like structure was along the sylvian fissure between the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus after the sphenoid ridge (the position of the “valve”-like structure is near the arrow shown in Figure 2(c)) the length along the sylvian fissure was about 5 cm. After separating the arachnoid and removing the Surgicel to open the tumor resection cavity, a virtually clear effusion was noted in the tumor resection cavity in the sylvian cistern. Approximately 30 ml of the effusion was aspirated. As a result, cerebral tissue tension decreased, and the cerebral pulse was good. Subsequent examination revealed that a few blood clots were attached to the base of the tumor resection cavity. After removing the blood clots, no communication was found between the tumor cavity and the cerebral ventricle or cerebral cistern. Subsequently, the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern were fenestrated, and marsupialization of the relocated cerebral tissue was performed so that the tumor resection cavity could communicate with the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern and the effusion could enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation. The tumor resection cavity was then washed repeatedly, and the bone flap was returned to its initial location. No Surgicel was applied during the second operation.\n\n【15】One week later, a CT rescan of her head revealed return of effusion in the tumor resection cavity, and it was possible that the “valve”-like structure had reformed again. But the roof region of the tumor resection cavity had become wider than before (as shown by the arrow in Figure 2(d)). Since compression on the surrounding cerebral tissue was not severe, a conservative approach was adopted. Ten months later, MRI examination showed that the cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity had disappeared, and the tumor had not recurred 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(e)–2(g))</u>.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Reoperation after intracranial tumor resection is common in patients with cerebral retraction-induced cerebral edema, cerebral contusion, and/or intracranial hemorrhage, especially in patients with skull base tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. However, raised ICP or cerebral herniation as a result of the space-occupying effect of cyst formation in a tumor cavity after intracranial tumor resection is rarely encountered in clinical practice. In our retrospective analysis, we found that, among patients undergoing reoperation owing to high intracranial pressure, the rate of reoperation as a result of high intracranial pressure secondary to cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity was approximately 2%. Although intracranial tumor resection cavities filled with fluid are not unusual in patients with large intracranial tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, they often spontaneously diminish or even disappear after cerebral compression is relieved by tumor resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Cyst formation in an intracranial tumor resection cavity is very rare.\n\n【18】After intracranial tumor resection, a pale yellow liquid may be produced by the residual tumor or wound surface and accumulate in the tumor resection cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Such accumulation may occur at an early (average 5.6 weeks) or late (average 3.6 years) stage after tumor resection. Although the space-occupying effect may occur, reoperation owing to development of cerebral hernia is rare. Even if surgery is needed, the prognosis is good, and no repeat cyst formation has been noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In cases 1 and 2 , the liquid aspirated from the tumor resection cavity had a nonyellow color, and cyst formation occurred 3 and 6 days after surgery, respectively, significantly shorter than periods reported in the literature. More importantly, cyst formation recurred rapidly after surgery and regressed over several months. These findings are inconsistent with previous reports mentioned above, suggesting the possible existence of other mechanisms. Cyst formation may also be caused by inflow and accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the tumor resection cavity as a result of communication with the cerebral ventricle or cistern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Although the tumors in both case 1 and case 2 were close to the temporal and frontal horns of the lateral ventricle, intraoperative examination and postoperative imaging revealed no communication between the tumor resection cavity and the cerebral ventricle. If communication occurs, the accumulated fluid in the tumor resection cavity may flow back to the cerebral ventricle, which may not give rise to raised ICP. Therefore, the possibility that cyst formation is caused by communication between the tumor resection cavity and the cerebral ventricle can be excluded.\n\n【19】So what mechanism caused the cyst formation? In case 1 , an intracerebral operation was performed to remove the temporal lobe glioma. In case 2 , resection of the sphenoid ridge meningioma was conducted in the space between cerebral tissue and the dura mater at the skull base; therefore this procedure was an extracerebral operation. Despite large differences in clinical characteristics and surgical procedures, repeated cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity was noted in both cases. Of note, both patients had a large tumor and a large tumor cavity after tumor resection. Exploratory surgery revealed that a “valve”-like structure had formed by relocated cerebral tissue, Surgicel, and the arachnoid in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity. Furthermore, we also found that the liquid aspirated from the tumor cavity had the properties of the cerebrospinal fluid. We therefore surmise that the “valve”-like structure may only permit unidirectional flow of cerebrospinal fluid. When raised ICP occurred, the cerebrospinal fluid entered into the tumor resection cavity via the “valve”-like structure which then sealed the tumor resection cavity, so preventing the effusion from entering the cerebrospinal fluid circulation and resulting in accumulation of liquid in the tumor resection cavity to produce a space-occupying effect. This is similar to the mechanism responsible for the formation of subdural hygroma or iatrogenic cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–14\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Rao reported a case of an expanding iatrogenic cyst following temporal lobectomy. In that case, it was proposed that a ball valve obstruction to flow of CSF occurred at the trigone. Ventricular CSF outflow would be forced into the cyst with the increased pressure of respiratory inspiration and cardiac systolic pulses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Kutlay et al. reported a case with iatrogenic arachnoid cyst with distinct clinical picture as a result of bone defect in the floor of the middle cranial fossa, in the case with time CSF entrapment in iatrogenic cyst, which supported the probable existence of a valvular mechanism, leading to the progressive accumulation of fluid within the cyst. Additionally, the cyst itself might have acted as a conductor for transmitting the pulsatile forces of the brain and CSF, and this condition also contributed to enlargement of the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Thus, it is reasonable for us to speculate that the formation of the iatrogenic “valve”-like structure is responsible for cyst formation in the tumor cavity after intracranial tumor resection. The formation of such an unidirectional “valve”-like structure is presumably in part iatrogenic. As the cortical tissue located on the surface of the tumor was not resected, it may provide an anatomical basis for the formation of the “valve”-like structure .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Diagram showing the “valve”-like structure on the surface of the brain. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【22】To prevent return of the effusion in the tumor resection cavity after the reoperation, we aspirated the effusion in the tumor cavity, opened up the communication of the cavity with the surrounding subarachnoid space and cerebral cistern, resected the “valve”-like structure, and marsupialized relocated cerebral tissue so that the effusion could enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation. However, the immediate postoperative outcome was poor as effusion recommenced in the tumor resection cavity in both cases because of the reformation of the “valve”-like structure. What is the hypothesis about the fact that the cyst postoperatively returns despite the fact that the “valve”-like structure was resected? A retrospective image analysis revealed the presence of edema in the cerebral tissue surrounding the tumor resection cavity. After the “valve”-like structure was surgically resected, edema could push the cortex toward the place of the former “valve”-like structure, which made it reform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Therefore, we speculate that the “valve”-like structure may reform as a result of the presence of cerebral edema, and when the roof region of the tumor cavity remains very narrow, the effusion in the tumor resection cavity cannot enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, and so it builds up. Subsequent “valve”-like structures were weaker than the earlier ones, so as cerebral edema regresses, the anatomical mechanism underlying the formation of the “valve”-like structure diminishes, allowing the tumor cavity effusion to enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation efficiently and resolving the effusion.\n\n【24】Currently there are three main surgical options for the treatment of developmental and iatrogenic cysts: craniotomy with excision of the cyst membrane, CSF drainage (either from the cyst or from the lateral ventricle), and cyst fenestration by means of stereotactic or endoscopic techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–19\\]</u>. For the cases in this paper, the first option was not feasible because there was no cyst membrane to excise. It was also difficult to excise the cyst since it was not possible to resect the anatomical basis of the “valve”-like structure. Long-term CSF drainage was not possible either due to potential for infection. Thus craniotomy with resection of the “valve”-like structure was the best option, although in this paper the resection of brain tissue around the “valve”-like structure was not enough so that the roof region of the tumor cavity remained very narrow.\n\n【25】In case 1 , postoperative CT reexamination revealed the opening and resealing of the roof region of the tumor resection cavity, suggesting possible disappearance and reformation of the “valve”-like structure 通用删除1(英):<u>(as shown by the arrows in Figure 1)</u>. In case 2 , postoperative examination showed that the roof region of the tumor resection cavity became widened 通用删除1(英):<u>(as shown by the arrow in Figure 2)</u>, and cyst reformation was attenuated, suggesting that the effect produced by the “valve”-like structure is weakened. These imaging changes indirectly confirm our hypothesis that the “valve”-like structure is responsible for cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity. Thus, we speculate that resection of the cortical tissue located on the surface of the tumor to widen the roof region of the tumor resection cavity may avoid the formation of the “valve”-like structure.\n\n【26】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【27】In conclusion, we describe two cases of reoperation as a result of raised ICP owing to cyst formation in the tumor cavity following intracranial tumor resection. We hypothesize that the presence of a “valve”-like structure in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity is responsible for cyst formation in the cavity. Surgical resection of this and marsupialization of the cortex provide good long-term outcomes in such patients though short-term outcomes are unsatisfactory, and we speculate that if the resection of the cortical tissue around the “valve”-like structure is wide enough, the problem may be avoided.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 66-year-old male patient presented to the emergency room (ER) with shortness of breath, cough, and generalized fatigue for two days; he tested positive for COVID-19 infection. However, he had a stable O<sub>2</sub> saturation and was discharged accordingly. Five days following discharge, the patient represented to the ER with shortness of breath and neglected priapism of three days duration.\n\n【7】On his second ER visit, his O<sub>2</sub> sat was 78% on room air, 92-93% on 15 L/min nonrebreather mask, blood pressure was 126/81 mmHg, respiratory rate was 21/min, pulse rate was 110 beats per minute, and body temperature was 36.9°C. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 15 out of 15.\n\n【8】On examination, the patient was conscious and distressed. A priapism was observed together with blackened areas on the glans penis extending to the midpenile shaft denoting penile gangrene. A clear line of demarcation was noticed at the midpenile shaft.\n\n【9】The patient’s medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), ischemic cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease (CKD): stage 3b with baseline creatinine 1.5-1.6 mg/dL, atrial fibrillation, an old cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with no residual weakness apart from baseline expressive aphasia, and depression.\n\n【10】The patient’s medications included amlodipine, insulin NovoMix, and hydralazine. He had also been taking warfarin 7.5 mg once daily and risperidone 0.25 mg and mirtazapine 30 mg once daily as needed for the past five years.\n\n【11】Laboratory findings at admission showed leukocytes of 10.70 × 10 e3/uL (4.00–11.00), hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL (13.5–17.2), platelet count 220 × 10 e9/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(150–450)</u>, prothrombin time (PT) 90 sec (11.0–15.0), international normalized ratio (INR) 7.19 (0.89–1.10), C-reactive protein (CRP) 219.50 mg/L (0.00–5.00), creatinine 244.20 umol/L (60.00–115.00), urea in serum 23.50 mmol/L (3.00–9.20), D-dimer 20.0 mg/L (0.0–0.5), and a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.\n\n【12】Penile duplex was performed and showed no blood flow in both cavernosal arteries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the penis was requested to evaluate for necrosis but was unavailable in the hospital, and the patient could not be transferred due to his desaturation status.\n\n【13】##### 2.1. Therapeutic Intervention\n\n【14】On admission, warfarin was withheld, and vitamin K 10 mg IV was administered together with four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to correct his elevated INR. He also received dexamethasone 6 mg IV and ceftriaxone 2 gm IV infusions. The patient was then admitted under the intensive care unit/internal medicine (ICU/IM) for further management of his COVID-19 infection and warfarin toxicity.\n\n【15】A suprapubic tube was placed to relieve urinary retention by the urology team, who further recommended penile aspiration/surgical intervention after INR correction. Later, in the same day, the patient developed hypoxia and was connected to high flow nasal canula (HFNC): FLOW 60, FIO<sub>2</sub> 100%, and stabilized. His INR had reduced from 7.14 to 1.70, and anesthesia consultation was done for surgical approval.\n\n【16】The patient was taken to the operating theatre (OR), and as he was very agitated and a trial of a local penile block was not feasible, general anesthesia was introduced. Penile aspiration was performed, and the cavernosal blood sample showed evidence of ischemic priapism. However, penile aspiration was not successful to alleviate his erection. Given the intraoperative findings and the patients’ poor general condition, it was decided to perform a partial penectomy.\n\n【17】Postoperatively, he was kept intubated and mechanically ventilated for three days, at which point he was successfully extubated. Eventually, he was discharged home with O<sub>2</sub> maintained on room air.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Priapism is a penile erection that lasts four hours or longer and is unrelated to sexual stimulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Priapism is grouped into three types: ischemic type (which requires immediate clinical intervention), nonischemic type, and stuttering (recurrent) priapism. Ischemic priapism (also known as venoocclusive priapism) is characterized by a painful penile erection which persists for a prolonged time leading to little or no blood flow to the corporal bodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Priapism can result from conditions associated with increased blood viscosity such as sickle cell disease and hematological malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, and hyperviscosity in patients with COVID-19 has been previously reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>, possibly accounting for the development of priapism in COVID-19 patients.\n\n【20】Moreover, COVID-19 is known to cause hypercoagulability although the underlying mechanisms for this are not well understood. Hypotheses include cytokine storm, complement activation, shutdown of fibrinolysis, and COVID-19 itself activating the coagulation cascade. Excessive release of cytokines causes thrombosis through a variety of processes, including the activation of monocytes, neutrophils, and the endothelium. All of these mechanisms can contribute to the prothrombic state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 19\\]</u>. It has been documented that COVID-19 patients can develop thrombotic events even when they are anticoagulated. Therefore, screening for thromboembolic events is essential in such patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In our literature review, we found eight cases of ischemic priapism, including one case of stuttering ischemia associated with COVID-19 infection . Reported cases included patients ranging in age from 34 to 69 years, of whom one was also undergoing warfarin therapy, as in the current case. By comparison to our case, however, priapism did not progress to gangrene in any of the previously reported cases nor did any patient require surgery. No known risk factor for priapism was reported in four cases, and detumescence was achieved with an intracavernosal injection in five of the eight cases.\n\n【21】Table 1 Documented cases of priapism related to COVID-19 infection in the literature.\n\n【22】In our presented case, there were many risk factors for developing priapism other than COVID-19 infection, including unopposed warfarin action and antidepressant medication. However, it is only COVID-19 that had a recent onset in our patient compared to his long-term use of antidepressants and warfarin. Regardless of the cause, however, priapism rarely progresses to penile gangrene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Other studies have also suggested that priapism was most likely induced by COVID-19 infection rather than other factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. All of these evidences strongly suggest the need for the diagnosis and prevention of thrombotic diseases in at-risk patients with COVID-19 infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

They may involve visceral organs with a lower percentage. Splenic lymphangioma is a rare tumor. This disease is often seen in children but may be diagnosed incidentally in adults. Most patients are asymptomatic, but in large and multifocal lesions, the patient may have some nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Physical examination may show no specific findings or detect palpable masses. The preoperative diagnosis of splenic lymphangioma is challenging. Histopathological evaluation and sometimes immunohistochemistry tests can result in a definitive diagnosis. In this study, we present an 18-year-old man, with Burkitt’s lymphoma who underwent laparotomy and total splenectomy as a result of cystic lesions discovered accidentally during imaging with the final diagnosis of splenic lymphangioma after histopathological evaluation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Lymphangioma is a benign neoplasm of lymphatic vessels, often affecting children’s head and neck areas. It is uncommon to find lymphangiomas in abdominal organs such as the kidney, adrenal, small bowel mesentery, liver, and spleen. Splenic lymphangioma is very rare and is often found incidentally. Nevertheless, some patients may experience nonspecific signs and symptoms such as abdominal pain and distention. Preoperative diagnosis would be difficult, and overdiagnosis might happen because radiological findings are also not specific. The ultimate diagnosis is usually made by histopathological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. Herein, we report a case of splenic lymphangioma in an adult patient who had a previous case of Burkitt’s lymphoma.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】An 18-year-old man was transferred to our center to be evaluated for splenic lesions, which were found incidentally during a routine annual follow-up for Burkitt’s lymphoma. He had no history of abdominal pain, fever, or weight loss. He has been a case of Burkitt’s lymphoma of the stomach since seven years ago and has received chemotherapy for one year. There was no sign of a disease recurrence, and all earlier ultrasonographic evaluations were unremarkable until the last follow-up, which revealed splenic lesions. Other past medical and family histories were not significant. On physical examination, blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg with a normal pulse rate and temperature, 68 beats per minute and 37.1°C, respectively. The abdomen was soft, and there was no organomegaly. Complete blood count (CBC) (white blood cell (WBC): 4.9 × 103/μl, hemoglobin: 14.2 g/dl, and platelet count: 211 × 103/μl) and liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were within normal ranges. Abdominopelvic ultrasonography revealed a hyperechoic mass measuring 24 mm and a cystic lesion measuring 9 mm in the spleen parenchyma. A spiral CT scan of the abdomen with contrast showed a few near together cystic lesions up to 18 mm in the anterosuperior aspect and a hypoattenuated subcapsular lesion measuring 24 mm in the posterior aspect of the spleen with faint enhancement after administration of contrast, suggestive of lymphomatous infiltration . The patient underwent laparotomy. The splenic lesions were multiple at the time of the operation, so a diagnostic splenectomy was performed for him. Gross sectioning of the spleen showed two multiloculated cystic lesions, the largest measuring 1.5 × 1 × 1 cm and containing some brownish fluid . Histological examination showed multiple large irregular cystic spaces lined by endothelial cells with smooth pinkish fluid in the lumen and lymphoid aggregation consisting of lymphangiomas 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a) and 3(b))</u>. Two months later, no clinical or radiologic deficits were noted in a follow-up visit. We obtained the patient’s informed consent for publishing the case report and images. Our institutional approval was not required to publish the case details.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Abdominal spiral CT scan with contrast shows a few near together cystic lesions with faint enhancement after administration of contrast .</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Cut section of the spleen shows two well-defined multiloculated cystic lesions .</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Microscopic assessment shows vascular spaces containing pinkish fluid (a) (H&E × 40). The spaces are lined by endothelial cells (b) (H&E × 200).</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Splenic lymphangioma is a benign cystic neoplasm initially described by Frink in 1885, accounting for <0.007% of all tumors. It typically affects pediatric patients but is rarely found in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Sequestration of lymph tissue, aberrant lymph vessels budding, lack of integration with the venous system, and obstruction of lymph vessels are some theories to explain the pathogenesis of lymphangiomas.\n\n【12】The failure of the primordial lymphatics to connect to the main lymphatic vessels or veins, the lymphatic vessels’ inability to drain into the veins, the abnormal budding of the lymphatic vessels, and chronic inflammation are a few of the hypotheses that have been suggested for the etiopathogenesis of lymphangiomas. Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and vascular endothelial growth factor-R3 are also elevated. However, in adult patients, as in our case, only a tiny defect often exists in the lymphatic system, which can be compensated under healthy conditions. Pathologic conditions associated with an increased lymphatic volume may then result in the development of lymphangioma. There is speculation that trauma and infectious diseases are the catalysts for this development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 9, 10\\]</u>. Similarly, the fact that our patient developed a new splenic lesion that was not present in previous radiologic studies suggests that prior surgery and chemotherapy may have served as a trigger.\n\n【13】Clinical presentations depend on the tumor size. Most patients are asymptomatic, and the tumor is found incidentally. Large and multifocal lesions can, however, cause nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite, which are primarily brought on by the compression of nearby organs. Post-traumatic and spontaneous rupture of splenic lymphangiomas has also been reported. Moreover, it can lead to coagulopathy, hemorrhage, and portal hypertension. Physical examination is unremarkable or may detect a palpable mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 11–13\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Radiological findings are generally not specific. Splenic lymphangiomas in ultrasonography may appear as anechoic, hypoechoic, or hyperechoic lesions depending on whether the lymphatic fluid is infected, hemorrhagic, or hyperlipidemic. They have different diameters, with or without internal septation. Calcification is a nonspecific finding and may also be observed in splenic hydatid cysts. Like in our case, computed tomography (CT) scan reveals single or multiple well-defined thin-walled lesions that are usually hypodense, homogenous, and without significant contrast enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 12, 14\\]</u>. The lesions are often well-vascularized in angiography.\n\n【15】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows hypointense cystic lesions in T1-weighted images, yet on T2-weighted images, they look hyperintense when filled with hemorrhagic or proteinaceous material. There have been some reported instances of lymphangioma without F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. However, they may exhibit slightly enhanced F-18 FDG uptake as a result of lymphocytes and fluid joining the dilated lymphatic vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6, 15–19\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Gross appearance shows single or multiple cystic lesions in various sizes with a thick fibrous wall filled with clear fluid. Multiple lesions may have a honeycomb look. Histopathological evaluation reveals cystic lesions lined by endothelial cells and filled with an amorphous eosinophilic proteinaceous substance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 20, 21\\]</u>. Moreover, lymphangiomas are divided into three categories based on the size of the dilated lymphatic channels: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> capillary (supermicrocystic), 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> cavernous (microcystic), and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> cystic (macrocystic) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Immunohistochemistry can be used when there is a doubt about the ability to differentiate cystic lesions of splenic lymphangioma from other cystic lesions such as mesothelial cysts, epidermoid cysts, and parasite cysts. The cells lining the cystic walls in splenic lymphangioma stain positive for CD34, CD31, factor VIII, vascular endothelial growth factor 3, and podoplanin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22–24\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Total splenectomy is the recommended treatment choice after the diagnosis is confirmed to reduce the risk of consequences such as infection, bleeding, growth, and expansion of the lesions and spleen rupture. Splenic lymphangioma has a favorable outcome after total splenectomy, and the possibility of malignancy is scarce 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Our patient’s history of Burkitt’s lymphoma resulted in a misdiagnosis of lymphomatous involvement in a CT scan study. However, if used, MRI and PET scans could aid with a more precise diagnosis and prevent misdiagnosis. In addition, since the lesions were located superficially in the spleen, a more accurate preoperative diagnosis might result in cyst excision rather than an unnecessary total splenectomy.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】Splenic lymphangioma is an extremely rare tumor. Although this benign entity frequently affects children, it should be taken into consideration as a differential diagnosis in adults with acquired cystic lesions, especially in those who have already experienced intra-abdominal stress (surgery, trauma, infection, and so on).\n\n【22】#### Abbreviations\n\n| CBC: | Complete blood count |\n| --- | --- |\n| WBC: | White blood cell |\n| AST: | Aspartate aminotransferase |\n| ALT: | Alanine aminotransferase |\n| ALP: | Alkaline phosphatase |\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| FDG: | Fluorodeoxyglucose |\n| PET: | Positron emission tomography. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Gastric variceal bleeding is a life-threatening complication of splenic vein thrombosis, resulting from increased blood flow to short gastric vein. Traditionally, splenectomy is considered the treatment of choice. However, surgery in necrotizing pancreatitis is dangerous, because of severe inflammation, adhesion, and bleeding tendency. In the Warshaw operation, gastric variceal bleeding is rare, even though splenic vein is resected. Because the splenic artery is also resected, blood flow to short gastric vein is not increased problematically. Herein, we report a case of gastric variceal bleeding secondary to splenic vein thrombosis complicated by necrotizing pancreatitis successfully treated with splenic artery embolization. Splenic artery embolization could be the best treatment option for gastric variceal bleeding when splenectomy is difficult such as in case associated with severe acute pancreatitis or associated with severe adhesion or in patients with high operation risk.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) is present in 10~20% of patients with acute pancreatitis. NP should be managed as conservatively as possible because of a high operative mortality. A step-up approach with less invasive management is widely accepted nowadays for management of NP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Bleeding from gastric varices (GVs) secondary to splenic vein thrombosis (SVT) can be life-threatening. GVs secondary to SVT are caused by the imbalance between splenic inflow and outflow. In the setting of SVT, splenic arterial flow is patent, but splenic vein is occluded. Therefore, SVT leads to the increase in splenic outflow via the short gastric and gastroepiploic veins, known as left-sided or sinistral portal hypertension. The increased pressure within the short gastric vein causes submucosal venous dilatation in gastric fundus. It has a potential risk of massive hemorrhage from gastric varices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Traditionally, a splenectomy is considered as a treatment of choice for bleeding GVs secondary to SVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, it is sometimes very difficult and dangerous in the patients with NP because of inflammation, adhesion, and bleeding tendency. In the Warshaw operation—a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with splenic vein resection—the splenic artery and vein are resected with the distal pancreas. The splenic blood flow is preserved through the short gastric vessels and gastroepiploic vessels. In the report about the operative outcome of the Warshaw operation for 23 years, it has been reported that there were no clinical consequences of perigastric varices in 158 patients who underwent the Warshaw operation during a follow-up period of up to 21 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although the splenic vein is resected in this procedure, pressure in short gastric and gastroepiploic vein is not increased problematically, because the splenic artery is also resected. No patient who underwent this procedure needed splenectomy due to bleeding GVs. Therefore, the Warshaw operation is considered safe and feasible. This theory can be applicable to treat gastric varices secondary to SVT.\n\n【5】Some authors have reported that splenic artery embolization (SAE) is an effective alternative to splenectomy for the treatment of gastric variceal bleeding with left-sided portal hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Herein, we report a case of bleeding GVs secondary to SVT in NP, successfully managed by SAE without splenectomy.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【8】A 42-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of a necrotizing pancreatitis. He had no history of medication or alcohol consumption. Laboratory studies revealed white blood cell count 20,200/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin 17.4 g/dL, platelet count 25,8000/mm<sup>3</sup>, serum total bilirubin 2.17 mg/dL, AST 266 U/L, ALT 196 U/L, amylase 1670 U/L, and lipase 2673 U/L. An abdominal CT scan showed acute necrotizing pancreatitis with large amount of peripancreatic necrotic fluid collections 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and protease inhibitor and empirical antibiotics treatment was initiated. He presented a cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 20 minutes, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and mechanical ventilation were needed for combined multiorgan failure. An abdominal CT scan following 4 weeks of medical treatment in ICU demonstrated a huge pseudocyst 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. Despite endoscopic transgastric internal drainage and percutaneous drainage, fever and abdominal pain were not subsided. A follow-up abdominal CT scan after 8 weeks from admission revealed the decreased but still remaining large amount of necrotic collections 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u> and SVT with engorgement of perigastric veins 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(d))</u>. An emergency operation for necrosectomy and external drainage was performed. On operative field, severe adhesion and bleeding tendency was noted. On postoperative day 13, hematemesis occurred. Blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg and hemoglobin decreased from 11.2 g/dL to 7.6 g/dL. An abdominal CT scan revealed extravasation of contrast media at gastric cardia and fundus 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. After initial resuscitation, an emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. It showed a huge clot in the stomach, and active bleeding from gastric fundus was suspected. However, the focus of bleeding could not be identified exactly due to the presence of large clot and ongoing active bleeding 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. He was referred to intervention unit and underwent an emergency angiography. Celiac and splenic arteriography revealed no active bleeding from arterial system 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a)\\-3(b))</u>. Under suspicion of bleeding GVs, SAE was performed using vascular plug 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c))</u>. The vascular plug was placed at distal splenic artery just proximal to branching in splenic hilum. After SAE, splenic flow was remarkably decreased 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(d))</u>. During the procedure, his systolic blood pressure was 70~80 mmHg and heart rate was 140~150 beats per minute. Four packs of PRCs were transfused after SAE. After the procedure, bleeding stopped immediately, and no more episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was observed. An abdominal CT scan 2 days following the SAE showed no more bleeding. A small splenic infarction was seen, but the infarcted volume was less than 10% of total splenic volume 删除1:<u>(Figure 4(a))</u>. Any treatment for splenic infarction was not needed. At present, 4 months following the SAE, no more episode of variceal bleeding was observed and no infarcted area of spleen was seen on a follow-up abdominal CT scan 删除1:<u>(Figure 4(b))</u>.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Abdominal CT scan showed severe necrotizing pancreatitis.

Discussion\n\n【14】It is known that incidence of pancreatitis-induced SVT is 14%, and risk of GI bleeding in these patients is 12% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Thrombosed splenic vein with intact splenic artery induces hypertensive short gastric veins that can develop into varices in the gastric fundal submucosa. These varices are a potential source of significant upper GI bleeding 删除1:<u>(Figure 5(b))</u>. Traditionally, splenectomy is considered as a treatment of choice for GV bleeding secondary to SVT. The cause of bleeding is the imbalance between inflow and outflow of spleen, not a splenic pathology. Therefore, in this setting, rationale for splenectomy is to interrupt the arterial supply feeding the collateral draining veins and the gastric fundus varices, thus reducing the pressure of the system and consequently the risk of rebleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> 删除1:<u>(Figure 5(c))</u>. The spleen resection should be forced to interrupt the short gastric vessels, because no more blood outflow is present in spleen after ligation of short gastric veins. Therefore, if we can decrease pressure within short gastric veins and no more bleeding is present, splenectomy is not necessary.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 (a) Normal anatomy. The splenic inflows and outflows are balanced. (b) Thrombosed splenic vein and intact splenic artery induces hypertensive short gastric veins. It is a potential source of massive bleeding from gastric varices. (c) The rationale of splenectomy in the setting of gastric variceal bleeding is the complete interruption of blood flow in short gastric veins from spleen.

So, many pancreatic surgeons try to preserve spleen during distal pancreatectomy. The Warshaw operation, spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (SPDP) with splenic vessels resection, is one of options for distal pancreatectomy. In this procedure, the splenic blood flow is preserved by short gastric vessels and left gastroepiploic vessels. Although the splenic vein is resected in this procedure, pressure in short gastric and gastroepiploic vein is not increased problematically, because the splenic artery is also resected 删除1:<u>(Figure 6(a))</u>. This procedure has a theoretical risk of splenic infarction and perigastric varices. However, many pancreatic surgeons have reported the safety of the Warshaw operation. Warshaw group have reported that none of 158 patients who underwent the Warshaw operation developed GI bleeding and only 3 (1.9%) patients required a reoperation because of splenic infarction during a follow-up period of up to 21 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Kim et al. also have reported no clinical significant splenic infarctions or gastric varices in any case after the Warshaw operation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our center, we performed 19 cases of laparoscopic Warshaw operation from 2014. Splenic infarction was observed in 11 patients; however the infarcted volume was less than 10% in all patients, and no specific treatment was needed. No episode of GI bleeding was observed in all patients.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 (a) After the Warshaw operation, spleen is supplied by short gastric arteries and left gastroepiploic artery and drained by short gastric veins and left gastroepiploic vein. No gastric variceal bleeding was observed after the operation over 20 years of observation period. (b) After splenic artery embolization, pressure within short gastric veins is decreased. The blood flow of spleen is maintained similar to postoperative circumstance of the Warshaw operation. PV, portal vein; SMV, superior mesenteric vein; CV, coronary vein; IMV, inferior mesenteric vein; SA, splenic artery; SV, splenic vein; LGEA, left gastroepiploic artery; LGEV, left gastroepiploic vein; SGA, short gastric artery; SGV, short gastric vein; GVB, gastric variceal bleeding.</u>\n\n【18】On the basis of these clinical results after the Warshaw operation, SAE can be a treatment option for GV bleeding induced by SVT. After SAE, blood pressure in short gastric veins is decreased because the blood inflow to spleen is decreased. In addition, spleen can be preserved via short gastric and gastroepiploic blood supply similar to postoperative circumstance of the Warshaw operation 删除1:<u>(Figure 6(b))</u>. In our case, after SAE, drainage of fresh blood via nasogastric tube was stopped, and hypovolemic shock and anemia are recovered gradually. And very small region of spleen was infarcted, but no specific treatment was needed. Even though gastric and perigastric varices are still observed on abdominal CT scan, no episode of GI bleeding developed during the 4 months of follow-up period.\n\n【19】Any upper abdominal surgery in the patient with severe acute pancreatitis is very dangerous because of sever adhesion, inflammation, obscure anatomy, friable tissue, and bleeding tendency. Especially in necrotizing pancreatitis, a conservative or less invasive treatment is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Therefore, SAE could be the best treatment modality rather than splenectomy in GVs bleeding secondary to SVT in the patients with NP.\n\n【20】Nonselective SAE, embolization of main trunk of splenic artery, seemed more ideal than selective SAE, embolization of each branch of splenic artery, to preserve left gastroepiploic artery. Stone et al. reported 20~30% volume splenic infarction after nonselective SAE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. By contrast, Sankararaman et al. planned to embolize 80~90% of the spleen. After selective SAE, huge area of spleen was infarcted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In our case, we performed nonselective SAE; then only small portion of spleen was infarcted.\n\n【21】In conclusion, splenic artery embolization is a safe and feasible modality to manage bleeding gastric varices secondary to splenic vein thrombosis. Especially in necrotizing pancreatitis, it could be the best treatment modality in aspect of “step-up” approach. However, more studies are needed with long-term outcome to clarify the necessity of splenectomy.\n\n【22】#### Competing Interests\n\n【23】The authors declare no conflict of interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The Case\n\n【5】A 2-month-old girl was referred from the general practitioner to the Ear, Nose, and Throat Clinic with the preliminary diagnosis of laryngomalacia. She is a full term, normal delivered baby with a birth weight of 2.8 kg. She is on both breast and bottle feeds. She presented with a history of noisy breathing for 15 days which worsened during feeding. On examination, her weight was 3.5 kg, which falls below the 3rd percentile on the growth chart. She was afebrile and the rest of the vitals were normal. She was able to maintain an oxygen saturation of 96% at room air. She had inspiratory stridor with suprasternal and intercostal retraction. Flexible upper endoscopy showed a cystic lesion in the vallecula, about 1 cm in size. The cyst was pushing the epiglottis backward over the glottis and compromising the airway .\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Flexible upper endoscopy showing a vallecular cyst obstructing the airway.</u>\n\n【7】CT scan imaging was done on the same day and reported a retroglossal fairly defined rounded nonenhancing hypodense cystic lesion measuring about 9 mm, seen projecting into oropharynx. No soft tissue component was noted. A differential diagnosis of thyroglossal or retention cyst was suggested and clinical correlation was advised .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Sagittal CT scan showing a retroglossal fairly defined rounded nonenhancing hypodense cystic lesion measuring about 9 mm, seen projecting into oropharynx.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Axial CT scan showing a retroglossal fairly defined rounded nonenhancing hypodense cystic lesion measuring about 9 mm, seen projecting into oropharynx.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Coronal CT scan showing retroglossal fairly defined rounded nonenhancing hypodense cystic lesion measuring about 9 mm, seen projecting into oropharynx.</u>\n\n【11】Thyroid function test was done and showed normal results.\n\n【12】The patient was taken to the operating theater and a diagnostic direct laryngoscopy under general anesthesia demonstrated a cystic mass in the vallecula. The cyst originated from the lingual surface of the epiglottis and partially obscured the laryngeal inlet. The aryepiglottic folds, vocal cords, and subglottic region were normal, excluding other associated laryngeal pathologies. Laryngeal intubation was possible and tracheostomy was not needed. A microscope was used to magnify the surgical field and optimize visualization. The cyst was aspirated and contained a clear, transparent fluid. Aspiration was followed by partial cyst excision using microlaryngeal instruments. The cyst was grasped using a cups forceps and partially excised using micro laryngeal scissors. There was minimal bleeding from the excision margins. This was controlled by applying mild pressure using absorbent cotton gauze balls. The remaining cyst margins were then cauterized using electrocautery.\n\n【13】Histopathology showed a benign cyst underneath the stratified squamous epithelium and underlying edematous stroma. The cyst is lined by flattened squamous epithelium, devoid of contents. There was no inflammation or malignancy and a final diagnosis of benign supraglottic cyst was given.\n\n【14】Microbiology culture of the aspirated fluid grew coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus. The organisms were resistant to penicillin, cloxacillin, and erythromycin and sensitive to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and cephalexin. The patient was started on the appropriate antibiotic treatment according to the sensitivity results.\n\n【15】Postoperative follow-up showed complete recovery and at 3 months of follow-up the patient had no stridor and was thriving well.

Discussion\n\n【18】Vallecular cysts have been described as retention cysts which form due to ductal obstruction of the mucous glands or minor salivary glands in the vallecula and tongue base 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The lingual surface of the epiglottis has been described as the most common location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This is supported by a 10-year review of 238 patients by DeSanto et al. where 52% of laryngeal cysts were found to arise from the epiglottis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Similarly, this was found in the patient described in this report. Flexible upper endoscopy showed the cyst originating from lingual surface of the epiglottis.\n\n【20】Vallecular cyst is a rare entity and accounts for 10.5% to 20.1% of all laryngeal cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5\\]</u>.

Fatal or near fatal cases have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【22】In comparison, the patient in this report presented with stridor which worsened during feeding.

Thyroid screening and thyroid scan are advisable for all patients with vallecular cysts to rule out the lingual thyroid.\n\n【25】Thyroid function test was done for the patient in this report and was found to be normal.\n\n【26】Other differential diagnosis included cystic hygroma, lymphangioma, haemangioma, teratoma, hamartoma, dermoid cyst, thyroid remnant cyst, and thyroglossal duct cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Histologically, vallecular cyst is lined with squamous epithelium and contains respiratory epithelium with mucous glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Similarly, histopathology results of the patient in this report showed a cyst lined with flattened squamous epithelium.\n\n【28】The initial radiologic investigation may include the neck ultrasound which will confirm the cystic nature of the lesion. However, to more accurately delineate the size and extent of the cyst, CT scan and MRI are necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. On CT scan, vallecular cyst shows low-density attenuation. On MRI, the cyst appears hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 and shows no enhancement after injecting intravenous gadolinium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. CT scan was done for patient in this report and showed a fairly rounded nonenhancing hypodense cystic lesion. A differential diagnosis of thyroglossal or retention cyst was suggested and clinical correlation was recommended.\n\n【29】In cases where fetal vallecular cyst is suspected on antenatal ultrasound, a fetal MRI may be done. This will conclude the diagnosis and plan for perinatal intervention and parental counseling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Direct laryngoscopy remains as the gold standard for definitive diagnoses of laryngeal cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Direct laryngoscopy was done for the patient in this report which clearly demonstrated the cystic nature of the mass, its origin, and extent.\n\n【31】Various surgical techniques have been described for the management of vallecular cysts; these include aspiration, marsupialization, and excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. Marsupialization of the cyst is the preferred treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Different modalities have been used for this purpose; these include electro cautery, CO<sub>2</sub> laser, coblation, tonsillar snare, microdebrider, or microlaryngoscopic instruments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 11, 18, 19\\]</u>. Compared to complete excision, the recurrence rate after marsupialization has been reported as negligible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Aspiration of the cyst was done for this reported case followed by partial cyst excision using microlaryngeal instruments. The remaining cyst margins were then cauterized using electrocautery. The results were satisfactory with no cyst recurrence.\n\n【32】#### 4\\.

Synonyms for gastric NETs include carcinoid, well-differentiated endocrine tumor/carcinomas, and enterochromaffin-like cell NETs, and synonyms for NECs include poorly differentiated endocrine carcinomas and small cell and large cell endocrine carcinomas. NENs are classified into NET G1 (carcinoid) and G2, NECs, mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas, enterochromaffin cells, serotonin-producing NETs, and gastrin-producing NETs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma, NENs are classified into carcinoid tumors and endocrine carcinomas (small cell type and large cell type) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Although the prevalence of gastric NENs has recently risen, they are thought to be relatively rare tumors that account for less than 1% of all gastric tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In general, the majority of these tumors are NETs, whose courses are indolent and not life threatening. Concerning NETs, more than 100 years have passed since Oberndorfer proposed the term “carcinoid” in 1907 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In 1993, Rindi et al. advocated a classification system with three subtypes of gastric carcinoid tumors according to the clinicopathological features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, and this classification system is reflected in the 2010 WHO criteria. On this background, Gilligan et al. advocated a treatment algorithm for gastric carcinoid tumors, including the above-mentioned subtypes as well as the size and number of tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Recently, less invasive therapeutic options, such as endoscopic resection of the tumor, have been reported for small NETs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【12】NECs of the stomach are also rare, representing less than 10% of gastric NENs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 13\\]</u>, and such rarity has made it difficult to understand precisely their biological nature and to establish optimal treatment options. The NEC of our case was a difficult diagnosis to establish, and the immunohistochemistry played a major role. Microscopically, the patient’s tumor was uniform in shape and arranged in small microtubular structures (rosette-like arrangement) to form solid nests, with medium-sized, round-to-cuboid-shaped tumor cells on hematoxylin and eosin staining. On immunohistochemistry, the tumors are usually positive for synaptophysin and neuronal-specific enolase, but are rarely positive for the chromogranin A staining observed in our patient. In the 2010 WHO criteria, NENs are classified into NETs or NECs on the basis of the level of cellular proliferation, including the mitotic and Ki-67 indices. The mitotic index was 46/10 HPF and the Ki-67 labeling index was 70–80% in our case, so he was diagnosed as NEC. Lymphatic invasion was widely observed and lymph node involvement was seen in many nodes, suggesting the high-grade malignant nature of this tumor and showing the compatibility of the diagnosis. Aggressive surgery and chemotherapy should be considered for any NEC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy, splenectomy, and cholecystectomy was performed on our patient, and he has lived disease-free for three years without any maintenance therapy.\n\n【13】In conclusion, we described a case of sporadic gastric NEC. An adequate description of NECs should be globally and historically discussed in relation to the real manifestation of this tumor group, considering the evaluation of the Consensus Conference. The diagnosis and treatment of these tumors should be evaluated in large clinical studies.\n\n【14】#### Abbreviations\n\n| NEC: | Neuroendocrine carcinoma |\n| --- | --- |\n| NEN: | Neuroendocrine neoplasm |\n| NET: | Neuroendocrine tumor |\n| WHO: | World Health Organization. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Graves’ disease is an autoimmune thyroid disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Common manifestations of Graves’ disease include weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, fatigue, tremors, and exophthalmos, occurring in more than 50% of patients. In rare cases, findings may predominate in one organ system; isolated findings of diarrhea, anxiety, or gynecomastia (as in our case) may occur, distracting from the correct diagnosis. Case Report. We report on a 37-year-old male who presented to the primary care clinic with the chief complaint of a tender right-sided breast mass and with an associated loss of appetite and forty-pound weight loss. Laboratory evaluation revealed suppressed TSH and elevated free T4. A bilateral diagnostic mammogram revealed bilateral gynecomastia. A nuclear medicine thyroid uptake scan was subsequently ordered, which showed the diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with homogenous increased uptake throughout, consistent with Graves’ disease. Conclusion. It is important to keep a high index of suspicion for thyroid disease as hyperthyroid states may be deceiving in presenting with single organ system involvement. Although it is rare, gynecomastia is a known finding in Graves’ disease and can be the presenting sign.

Introduction\n\n【3】Graves’ disease is an autoimmune thyroid disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The disease is characterized by a hyperthyroid state secondary to autoantibodies that bind to and activate thyrotropin receptors, leading to an increase in thyroid hormone production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients of any age can be affected, however, the peak incidence is reported between the ages of 30 and 50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Common manifestations of Graves’ disease include weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, fatigue, tremors, and exophthalmos, occurring in more than 50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Rare manifestations such as localized dermatopathy and thyroid acropachy (i.e. clubbing) have been reported in less than 1% of cases. Men may present with decreased libido or erectile dysfunction, and women may present with irregular menses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In rare cases, findings may predominate in one organ system; isolated findings of diarrhea, anxiety, or gynecomastia (as in our case) may occur, distracting from the correct diagnosis. Gynecomastia is a common finding in hyperthyroidism, but it is rarely the presenting symptom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We present a case of Graves’ disease with a less common presentation of a unilateral breast mass.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 37-year-old Caucasian male presented to the primary care clinic with the chief complaint of a tender right-sided breast mass. The patient also reported decreased appetite and a forty-pound weight loss over the preceding five months. The breast mass had been present for about six weeks and was not associated with galactorrhea. The patient denied any fevers or night sweats and denied taking any hormonal or nutritional supplements. There was no reported family history of breast cancer or endocrine disorder. During a physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits, and the patient was noted to be thin, with a BMI of 21.6. Breast examination revealed a one-centimeter-by-one-centimeter, tender, right-sided mass without nipple discharge. The thyroid gland was nonpalpable, and there was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.\n\n【6】Laboratory evaluation revealed TSH of 0.01 mIU/L (reference range 0.40–4.5 mIU/L) with free T4 3.3 ng/dL (reference 0.93–1.7 ng/dL) and total T3 335 ng/dL (reference 80–200 ng/dL). The thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin level was noted to be >500 (normal <122%). Prolactin was found to be 7.2 ng/mL (reference range 4.0–15.2 ng/mL), and testosterone was noted to be 624 ng/dL (reference range 800–1080 ng/dL). A bilateral diagnostic mammogram revealed bilateral gynecomastia, right greater than left . A nuclear medicine thyroid uptake scan was subsequently ordered, which showed the diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with homogenous increased uptake throughout, consistent with Graves’ disease.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the (a) right breast and (b) left breast showing flame-shaped subareolar densities consistent with gynecomastia.</u>\n\n【8】On initial presentation, there was a high index of suspicion for breast cancer due to presenting symptoms of the right-sided breast mass associated with significant weight loss. The bilateral diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound were ordered for further workup of possible malignancy. Hyperthyroidism was also considered due to weight loss and palpitations; however, it was initially lower on differential diagnoses.\n\n【9】The patient was started on atenolol 25 mg daily upon laboratory diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. After confirmation of Graves’ disease on the thyroid uptake scan, the patient was referred to endocrinology. He was subsequently prescribed methimazole 10 mg twice daily.\n\n【10】After two months of treatment with twice daily methimazole, repeat bloodwork showed TSH 0.45 mIU/L (within normal limits), free T4 0.39 ng/dL (normal 0.93–1.7 ng/dL), and total T3 58 (normal 80–200). On repeat evaluation, the breast mass was no longer palpable, and the patient reported significantly improved energy levels and decreased palpitations. The weight of the patient, however, was unchanged. Over the last five years, multiple attempts at tapering off methimazole have been unsuccessful. He has been maintained on 5 mg methimazole daily with stable thyroid function labs. He has declined definitive therapy with radioactive iodine ablation.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Gynecomastia is defined as an enlargement in glandular tissue of the breast, which may present as unilateral or bilateral breast enlargement. This condition is commonly seen in patients with chronic liver disease and as a result of certain drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although it is rare, gynecomastia has been described as a common finding in hyperthyroid states, specifically in Graves’ disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. As a cutaneous feature of thyrotoxicosis, gynecomastia can be seen in 10–40% of cases; however, it is rarely seen as the presenting feature of the disease. It has been reported as a presenting feature of hyperthyroidism in less than ten cases to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The development of gynecomastia involves an imbalance between free estrogen and free androgen actions in breast tissue. Breast tissue enlargement occurs when there is a relative increase in estrogen production. In hyperthyroid states, the increase in concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin binds testosterone more avidly than estrogen, leading to an increase in the concentration of bioavailable estrogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Treatment of hyperthyroidism with control of thyrotoxicosis results in resolution of gynecomastia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our patient presented with the chief complaint of a unilateral breast mass associated with forty-pound weight loss. This presentation was initially concerning to the patient and physician for breast cancer due to the predominant involvement of only one organ system. On further investigation with diagnostic mammogram, the patient was found to have bilateral gynecomastia. Laboratory work and thyroid uptake scan confirmed diagnosis of Graves’ disease.\n\n【15】It is important to keep a high index of suspicion for thyroid disease as hyperthyroid states may be deceiving in presenting with single organ system involvement. Although it is rare, gynecomastia is a known finding in Graves’ disease and can be the presenting sign.

Very few cases of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection have been reported. Atraumatic splenic rupture, while rare, is associated with high mortality. Here, we report the first case of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection in the English literature and review the prior reported literature. The patient was diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia and subsequently developed hemorrhagic shock requiring emergency laparotomy and removal of the ruptured spleen.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Influenza viruses are divided into three types, influenza A, B, and C viruses. Influenza A viruses cause epidemic influenza and sporadic pandemics, and they are further classified into subtypes on the basis of the antigenic properties of two surface glycopeptides, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 18 different H subtypes and 11 different N subtypes (H1 to H18 and N1 to N11).

We report the first case in the English literature of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection and review the prior reported literature.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 50-year-old man with past medical history of hypothyroidism and cigarette smoking had been on vacation in Florida, USA, with his family for 3 weeks. The day of his return flight in July, he developed a sore throat and body aches followed by fever and a productive cough. He went to urgent care, was diagnosed with acute bronchitis, and was treated as outpatient with azithromycin and prednisone for 5 days without improvement. On the eighth day of symptoms, he developed confusion and was brought to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation.\n\n【8】In the ED, the patient had mild shortness of breath but denied nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. On physical exam, he had temperature 38.3°C, heart rate 120 beats/min, respiratory rate 25 breaths/min, and SpO<sub>2</sub> 90% on room air, with coarse breath sounds bilaterally on lung exam; he was started on oxygen 2 L/min via nasal cannula. A chest X-ray showed bibasilar lung infiltrates. Testing revealed white blood cell count 9.0 k/uL (4.0–10.0 k/uL), hemoglobin (Hb) 15.8 g/dL (13.0–18.0 g/dL), platelets 249 k/uL (150–400 k/uL), international normalized ratio 1.4 (≤3.5), protime 15.1 seconds (10.0–12.0 seconds), partial thromboplastin time 37.4 seconds (25.0–35.0 seconds), blood urea nitrogen 28 mg/dL (9–20 mg/dL), creatinine 1.46 mg/dL (0.66–1.25 mg/dL), total protein 7.5 g/dL (6.3–8.2 g/dL), albumin 3.9 g/dL (3.5–5.0 g/dL), total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL (0.2–1.3 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 195 U/L (38–126 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 160 U/L (21–72 U/L), and aspartate aminotransferase 243 U/L (17–59 U/L). Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen tests were negative. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed a contracted gallbladder with probable calculi and normal pancreas and spleen. He was diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia, started on intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and admitted to the medical floor. He was also started on heparin 5000 U subcutaneously every 8 hours for thromboembolism prophylaxis.\n\n【9】The patient’s shortness of breath deteriorated overnight. Chest X-ray showed worsening lung infiltrates, predominantly in the left lung. He had increased work of breathing and worsening hypoxemia requiring oxygen via high flow nasal cannula and transfer to the intensive care unit. More information was obtained from the family: his wife and father also had developed a cough and no one in the family including the patient had ever received influenza vaccination. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) respiratory viral panel on a nasopharyngeal swab sample was positive for influenza A (H1N1) virus, and therapy was started with oseltamivir.\n\n【10】The patient’s respiratory status continued to worsen. He developed hypotension and severe abdominal pain on the third day of hospitalization. Serum amylase was 157 U/L (30–110 U/L) and lipase 1454 U/L (23–300 U/L). Hb decreased from 15.8 to 7.4 g/dL. Coagulation parameters were normal. Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.5 (7.35–7.45), PaCO<sub>2</sub> 21 mm Hg (35–45 mm Hg), and PaO<sub>2</sub> 52 mm Hg (80–100 mm Hg) on high flow nasal cannula FiO<sub>2</sub> 70% at 50 L/min and the patient was subsequently intubated. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen revealed lung consolidation of the left upper lobe and infiltrates in both lower lobes and right middle lobe, with no evidence of pulmonary embolism . The lateral margin of the spleen was indistinct and with low density areas, concerning for splenic injury or rupture . The patient denied any prior abdominal trauma.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Computed tomography scan (CT) of the chest showing infiltrates in both lower lung lobes.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Initial computed tomography scan (CT) of the abdomen showing perihepatic and perisplenic fluid, and the lateral margin of the spleen indistinct with low density areas, concerning for splenic injury or rupture.</u>\n\n【13】Due to these findings along with suspected ongoing hemorrhage with decreasing Hb values since admission, the patient underwent an embolization of the splenic artery by interventional radiology. Despite this procedure, Hb values continued to decrease, remaining at 7.7 g/dL despite transfusion with 3 units of packed red blood cells. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy with splenectomy to control the hemorrhage. During the surgery, there was extensive hemoperitoneum and the spleen capsular surface was found to be hemorrhagic with a large laceration in the mid portion . Pathologic examination revealed a spleen with weight 521 g and size 15 cm × 10 cm × 6 cm. The capsular surface was deep red due to hemorrhage with an irregular 10 cm laceration in the mid portion nearly bisecting the specimen with an intact hilar margin. There was a slightly puckered area located 5.5 cm from the point of laceration with an underlying somewhat stellate area of apparent fibrous tissue with vascular proliferation consistent with a hemangioma measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The splenic parenchyma was red brown. There was a large hematoma with a focal rim of tan white fibrous tissue. There was no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Appearance of the spleen after splenectomy. The capsular surface was hemorrhagic with an irregular 10 cm laceration in the mid portion nearly bisecting the spleen with an intact hilum.</u>\n\n【15】A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the operating room after the splenectomy, and the culture was positive for influenza A (H1N1) virus only. Infectious mononucleosis and malaria work up were negative. The patient was continued on oseltamivir for treatment of influenza pneumonia and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, was extubated successfully after 14 days of mechanical ventilatory support, and was discharged home in good condition after 40 days of hospitalization.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】We present the case of a patient with severe influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia and respiratory failure, who experienced atraumatic splenic rupture requiring emergency splenectomy to control hemorrhagic shock. While associated with other viral infections, atraumatic splenic rupture has been very rarely reported in association with influenza infection, and to our knowledge, never in the English literature as the only associated condition.\n\n【18】In addition to its common symptoms, some patients with influenza A (H1N1) virus infection develop severe disease, complicated with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and other organ damage such as myositis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, encephalopathy, and liver function abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition to pneumonia and respiratory failure, our patient experienced acute renal failure and transaminitis, as well as an atraumatic splenic rupture with hemorrhagic shock, requiring multiple transfusions and emergency splenectomy after a failed splenic artery embolization. Splenic rupture can be life-threatening and requires a high index of clinical suspicion and emergent intervention to prevent death. Since the spleen plays a key role in combating infection, a conservative, interventional, or spleen-preserving surgical approach should be attempted first. However, total splenectomy should be performed for patients with severe rupture, hemodynamic instability, or continued and recurrent bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Atraumatic splenic rupture is rare. Common causes include infection, neoplasms, and vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 10\\]</u>. One large systematic review reported 613 cases of splenic rupture without risk factors or previously diagnosed diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Malaria, mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus infection, and typhoid fever were common infectious causes. Only 3 cases were associated with pneumonia, 2 of them caused by Legionella infection. Influenza infection was not reported in that study. Another systematic review reported 845 patients with atraumatic splenic rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>; of those, 137 patients had an infectious cause, but none had influenza infection.\n\n【20】The precise pathologic mechanisms implicated in atraumatic splenic rupture have not been conclusively determined and probably vary from case to case. Mechanisms that have been proposed in different cases include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> increased intra-abdominal pressure (related to coughing, sneezing, emesis, defecation, and pregnancy) leading to accumulated trauma on the splenic capsule; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> an increase in intrasplenic tension due to cellular hyperplasia and vascular engorgement; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> reticular endothelial hyperplasia resulting in thrombosis and infarction, leading to hemorrhage and rupture of the splenic capsule. In addition, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and platelet dysfunction may prolong hemorrhage that would otherwise be self-limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【21】It is possible that an exaggerated immune response to influenza infection may play a role in this rare complication. The influenza A (H1N1) virus has been isolated on organ samples of the lung, brain, kidney, and spleen on animal experiments, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and it has also been reported that the spleen plays a particularly active role in the innate immune response to influenza A (H1N1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The precise mechanisms involved in this case are unclear, but there was a productive cough present which could have contributed to the rupture and the patient was also receiving a prophylactic dose of heparin. While a very small hemangioma was noted on histologic examination, there was no evidence of bleeding in its location.\n\n【22】So far, there have been at least 5 other cases reported of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection, none in the English literature. The first case was in Russia (former Soviet Union) in 1963 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A 43 y/o woman with severe influenza reported mild pain in the left upper abdomen. She was treated as an outpatient and recovered completely. One month after the symptoms started, she developed severe abdominal pain in the same area and fever 38°C. Four days later, she was admitted to the hospital with severe diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, fever 38.5°C, and unmeasurable blood pressure. On exam, she was very pale, the abdomen was distended and tender, and a fluid shift was present. She was treated for hemorrhagic shock and underwent emergency laparotomy with splenectomy. Surgical findings were an enlarged ruptured spleen and 1.5 L of blood and clots in the abdominal cavity. On pathology, the spleen was congested with blood, with lymphoid hyperplasia and necrotic tissue around the rupture. The patient recovered.\n\n【23】The second case occurred in Poland in 1964 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A 22-year-old male had influenza and related symptoms for 10 days. One day after admission, he developed severe pain in the left epigastric and lumbar regions and anemia that did not respond to transfusion. On the sixth day, the pain increased, and the patient underwent a laparotomy with splenectomy. An enlarged, necrosed spleen was noted with blood clots surrounding it and 1 L of blood in the peritoneal cavity. He recovered.\n\n【24】A third case was reported in Ukraine (former Soviet Union) in 1969 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A 60-year-old woman was admitted with influenza pneumonia confirmed by antibody titers. She had severe headache, fever 38.1°C, cough, and rhinorrhea. Over the next four days, all symptoms resolved, but she then developed acute, severe pain in the epigastric area, nausea, and vomiting. Blood pressure was 80/40 mm Hg, with severe tachycardia and Hb 5.2 g/dL. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy for worsening shock. During the surgery, 2 L of blood and clots were found in the abdominal cavity along with a ruptured spleen requiring splenectomy. On pathology of the spleen, there was significant sclerosis of the red pulp and of the stroma surrounding the follicles. Almost all vessels were significantly narrowed with thickened walls; parts of the vessel walls had necrotic changes and there was cellular debris in some follicles. The patient was discharged home 2 months later. Of note, the article references one additional case of splenic rupture with influenza authored by PM Geyler in 1963; full reference was not provided, and the report was not able to be located despite a comprehensive search.\n\n【25】A fourth case was published in Hungary in 1979 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A 57-year-old man with influenza had experienced 7 days of fever and limb pain at home and was already improving. He then developed weakness and dizziness and was admitted to the hospital. He had abdominal pain, Hb 9.9 g/dL, tachycardia, and hypotension. He underwent laparotomy where a large amount of clotted blood was found in the abdominal cavity. The spleen had a transverse rupture of 1.5 cm on its anterior surface, which did not penetrate the entire thickness and a splenectomy was done. On gross examination, the spleen weighed 160 g and demonstrated a 3 cm disruption laterally in the lower third extending 5–6 mm into the parenchyma. On microscopy, the follicular pattern was preserved with prominent germinal centers. Areas of parenchymal hemorrhage were also noted. The histological picture was thought to be similar to changes seen in sepsis, which suggested to the authors the possibility of a viral infection as the cause.\n\n【26】A fifth case was published in Spain in 2011 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A 36-year-old man had fever 39.5°C, vomiting, diarrhea, and epigastric pain for 5 days and was admitted. On exam, he had blood pressure 95/55 mm Hg and heart rate 100 beats/min. One day later, the patient had intense abdominal pain and lost consciousness when standing. His Hb was 8.9 g/dL and an abdominal CT showed lung alveolar infiltrate in the bases and a splenic rupture with active hemorrhage and hemoperitoneum. A laparotomy with splenectomy was done. On pathology, the spleen was of normal size with the external surface showing some hemorrhagic areas with adherent clots that covered less than 5% of the external surface. A histologic diagnosis of capsular rupture with hemorrhagic foci over a normal spleen was made. After the urgent surgery, the patient recovered and was later diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia with a positive PCR test.\n\n【27】The above mentioned 5 cases, except for the last one, were reported more than 40 years ago. Reports were brief, with limited information provided including figures and diagnostic methods and with outdated terminology. They do, however, have all in common a diagnosis of splenic rupture without a history of prior trauma and an associated diagnosis of influenza, with the influenza-related symptoms preceding the abdominal signs and symptoms, anemia, and hemorrhagic shock associated with the splenic rupture.\n\n【28】Besides the abovementioned cases, there is one reported case in the English literature of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza A (H1N1) infection. However, this case also had coinfection with Legionella pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, which has also been associated with splenic rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, so it cannot be ruled out that the splenic rupture could be due to Legionella infection instead of the influenza infection, or due to coinfection. The patient was a 42-year-old man who was hospitalized with fever of 39°C, progressive dyspnea, and nonproductive cough. On admission, he had anemia with Hb of 5 g/dL and tested positive both for influenza A (H1N1) virus by PCR test on a throat swab and for Legionella by urinary antigen test and PCR in peripheral blood. Total body CT showed extensive bilateral interstitial pneumonia and signs of incipient splenic rupture. He underwent laparotomy with splenectomy. Histological examination showed diffuse splenic intravascular coagulation. The patient achieved full clinical recovery.\n\n【29】In conclusion, we present a very rare case of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza A (H1N1) infection, which required emergency laparotomy with splenectomy to control hemorrhage after a failed splenic artery embolization. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the English literature of this complication associated with influenza infection, and only one of a handful reported previously worldwide. Clinicians should be aware of this very rare but potentially fatal complication of influenza infection, in particular in patients who develop abdominal signs and symptoms, unexplained anemia, and hemodynamic instability.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Electrocardiogram  revealed complete atrioventricular block associated with atrial tachycardia. Thus, this patient was sent to our intensive care unit for cardiac investigation. Clinical history revealed New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II dyspnea, associated with clinical signs of global heart failure. Chest radiography demonstrated cardiomegaly and bilateral hilar overload. Transthoracic echocardiography 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a), see Movie 1 Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2011/740928)</u> revealed extensive localized thickening of the right ventricle, right atrium, interatrial septum, and basal to mid interventricular septum associated with a pericardial effusion. The infiltration extended around the root of the pulmonary artery and aorta 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b), Movie 2)</u>. Left ventricular systolic function was slightly impaired (ejection fraction = 54%). Analysis of tissue Doppler indices showed elevated left ventricular filling pressures (E/E′ ratio = 16.4). Blood sample tests found an isolated inflammatory syndrome: C-Reactive Protein raised to 50 mg/L. Nt-proBNP increased to 1150 pg/mL ( 𝑁 < 1 2 5  pg/mL). Serological tests for a bacterial, fungal, or immunological (including anti-nuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor) cause were negative. QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was negative, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme level was normal. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed to localize and characterize the nature of the tissue thickening. Four-chamber 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c), Movie 3)</u>, apical short-axis, and long-axis (Movie 4) cine images were performed using steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine sequences. The right ventricular wall was akinetic, with preservation of apical contractility. Short-axis dark-blood T2-weighted 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a) and 3(b))</u> sequences confirmed concentric thickening and oedema of the right ventricle. First-pass perfusion 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(d), Movie 5)</u> showed enhancement of the right ventricular and interventricular septum infiltration consistent with an active inflammatory process.

Right ventricular myocardial biopsy and implantation of a dual-chamber epicardial pacemaker were performed via a sternal thoracotomy.

Neither giant cells nor epithelioid cells were observed, thus rejecting the diagnoses of giant cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis. Vessels were not specifically concerned with the cellular infiltrates, so that a diagnosis of vasculitis was also excluded.

Echocardiography revealed persistent myocardial infiltration, although the pericardial effusion had resolved. The patient remained pacemaker dependent with underlying complete heart block, which is probably the consequence of infiltration of the cardiac conduction system with granulomatous tissue. Nt-proBNP had decreased to 550 pg/mL.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】We report a fairly special case of lymphocytic myocarditis progressing to a fibrotic stage, described using multi-modality imaging and confirmed on histopathology. This paper presents an uncommon diagnosis with a probable guarded prognosis.\n\n【15】First, although MRI and other imaging modalities findings are relatively nonspecific, we can notice the ability of dark-blood T2-weighted and first-pass perfusion imaging to detect, respectively, oedema and enhancement of the right ventricular free wall and the interventricular septum infiltration consistent with an active inflammatory process. Consequently, we decided a corticosteroid therapy in order to clear inflammation. Furthermore, we confirm in this paper CMR’s ability to depict myocardial fibrosis on delayed enhancement imaging. We can suppose that this fibrous infiltration of the right ventricle and basal to mid interventricular septum is responsible for the persistence of conduction disturbances. Thus, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging detected oedema, residual inflammatory process, and myocardial fibrosis, which may influence patient’s management. We regret that a second CMR control could not be performed because of the pacemaker.\n\n【16】Secondly, this patient presented incidentally with apparently idiopathic cardiac granulomatosis, probably being longstanding. We used the term “granulomatous” because of the nature of nodular lesions and the presence of histiocytes associated with lymphocytic elements. Cardiac sarcoidosis and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis are usually clinicopathologic entities evocated in this situation. Okura et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> demonstrated, in a large series of patients, histological differences between cardiac sarcoidosis and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis: the first has more granulomas and fibrosis, while the second one more necrosis, foci of lymphocytic myocarditis and eosinophils. The number of giant cells is equivalent in the two entities. Presentation with heart failure predicted idiopathic giant cell myocarditis, whereas presentation with heart block or more than nine weeks of symptoms is associated with cardiac sarcoidosis. There is still an open debate as to whether idiopathic giant cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis are separate disorders. However, in this case, neither giant cells nor epithelioid cells were observed, thus rejecting the diagnoses of giant cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis. Thus, a viral-negative lymphocytic myocarditis which had progressed to a fibrotic and granulomatous stage was the most plausible diagnosis, although we recognize that infiltration of the aortic root and the right atrium is very unusual in case of myocarditis. Surprisingly, in this patient presenting with chronic myocarditis and persistent inflammation, nested/reverse transcription-PCR did no detect any genomes of virus. Gutberlet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> observed that viral genomes were amplified at nested PCR assay in 49 (59%) of the 83 patients presenting with chronic myocarditis. Parvovirus B19 was the most frequently detected virus. Because lymphocytic myocarditis has multiple etiologies, therapy should be individualized according to the specific etiology. Unfortunately, efficacy of most therapies used or proposed for use in lymphocytic myocarditis has not been proven. Until this proof is available, specific and nonspecific antiviral measures should be considered for use in those patients who present with documented ongoing viral infection. Likewise, appropriate antimicrobial is always indicated in lymphocytic myocarditis caused by bacterial and other organisms. The area of greatest controversy is the use of immunosuppressive and other immunomodulatory therapies for noninfectious and postinfectious myocarditis. In our case we hypothesize that corticosteroid therapy may be effective in clearing the residual inflammatory process. Healing of myocarditis lesions may result in some degrees of fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. Earlier series have shown that symptoms do not reflect the extent of lymphocytic infiltrate and fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, we can notice that our patient presented with severe heart failure, and in parallel the endomyocardial biopsy showed significant fibrosis.\n\n【17】Thirdly, this paper presents an uncommon diagnosis with a probable guarded prognosis. Magnani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported in 112 patients with histopathologic confirmation of myocarditis that 88 (79%) and 63 (56%) were alive without cardiac transplantation at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Furthermore, Davidoff et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> observed that the presence of atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker insertion was predictive of a subsequent fatal outcome in both giant cell and lymphocytic myocarditis.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】We report a fairly special case of lymphocytic myocarditis progressing to a fibrotic stage, described using multi-modality imaging and confirmed on histopathology. The combination of CMR with various image acquisition sequences associated with other imaging modalities provides a noninvasive morphological assessment and tissue characterization of myocardial involvement.

Common manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from its initial official introduction are mostly related to the respiratory system. However, other rarer presentations are reported nowadays. Case Presentations. We reported three cases of COVID-19-infected patients with rhabdomyolysis as well as two other rarer simultaneous signs, including hypocalcemia (Case 1) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (Case 2). Conclusion. Despite the fact that rhabdomyolysis is an infrequent manifestation of COVID-19, high clinical suspicion is required for proper diagnosis and management of this disease as well as other concurrent rarer presentations, including hypocalcemia and DKA for the prevention of further complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerges as a novel infectious agent with several body organs’ involvement. This disease’s most common presentations are fever, dry cough, fatigue, or myalgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, some patients develop severe symptoms, including shortness of breath, requiring further therapeutic support. On the other hand, rarer manifestations of COVID-19 have been declared.\n\n【4】Rhabdomyolysis is defined as muscle cell destruction resulting in subsequent leakage of cellular components to the bloodstream. This disease is mostly manifested with weakness, myalgia, electrolyte imbalance, myoglobinuria, or even acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However, the exact etiology of rhabdomyolysis among COVID-19 patients needs to be investigated in future studies.\n\n【5】Moreover, hypocalcemia is a common phenomenon among critically ill patients, and it has been reported that calcium plays a pivotal role in the replication mechanisms of some viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebolavirus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. For instance, a study done on patients suffering from SARS reported that hypocalcemia was prevalent in 70% of individuals during the hospitalization duration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Another study investigated the prevalence of hypocalcemia among severely ill COVID-19 patients and figured out that almost two-thirds of them had lower calcium levels and had subsequent worse outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is another rare manifestation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Goldman et al. reported that this disorder is prevalent among 1.8% of admitted patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Chan et al. performed a case series on six patients with COVID-19 admitted with DKA and/or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) and found that these two glucose imbalance disorders were the primary manifestations in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, the data are limited, and several future studies in terms of predisposing factors are required.\n\n【7】Herein, we reported three cases of COVID-19 patients with rhabdomyolysis as well as other concurrent rarer symptoms, including hypocalcemia and DKA.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【10】A 22-year-old man with no previous past medical history was referred to the emergency department with severe hypocalcemia (Ca: 5 mg/dl) as well as spastic muscles in both upper and lower extremities. Also, he was opium-addicted and used 15 cc of daily methadone. He had severe bloodless diarrhea from 20 days before admission managed with serum therapy. His vital signs were in normal ranges. He was conscious, but he appeared to be pale. He did not have any positive history in terms of nausea, vomiting, cough, or dyspnea. However, he suffered from generalized muscle spasms and pain. There was not any positive finding during heart and lung examinations. His abdomen was nontender, but pitting edema (2+) was observed in the lower extremities. Chvostek’s and Trousseau’s signs were positive, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a prolonged QT interval (QT = 550 msec). Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19, lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed and the results were highly suggestive of COVID-19 infection .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Multifocal peribronchial consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacities.</u>\n\n【12】In the first hour of admission, intravenous infusion of 10% calcium gluconate was initiated promptly, and muscle spasms disappeared within four hours. Intravenous calcium administration was then continued based on plasma-calcium and ECG monitoring. The patient had a myoclonic-like seizure with an upward gaze on the first night of hospitalization, while the serum level of calcium was 8.9 mg/dl. The result of the requested brain CT was negative. Unfortunately, the seizure recurred, and intravenous diazepam was prescribed. On the third day of admission, the calcium concentration reached 9.1 mg/dl, and the QT interval was corrected (QT = 405 msec). Other laboratory data collected during the admission time were as follows: lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) of 1740 U/L, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) of 1840 U/L, potassium of 6.9 mEq/l, sodium of 142 mEq/l, blood sugar of 234 mg/dl, albumin of 3.2 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 261 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 110 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 379 IU/L, parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 145 pg/ml, 25-hydroxy vitamin D of 32 ng/mL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 19 mg/dl, and creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dl.\n\n【13】His laboratory findings favored rhabdomyolysis, and fluid therapy was started promptly with concurrent seizure as well as hypocalcemia management to avoid acute kidney injury. Unfortunately, the patient had a cardiac and respiratory arrest, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was implemented, and he was connected to a ventilator. However, on the fourth day of hospitalization, the patient could not be resuscitated after the second cardiac arrest attack.\n\n【14】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【15】A 36-year-old man was referred to the emergency department with two days of polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, and vomiting. His medical history was positive for psychosis, and he consumed olanzapine, lorazepam, propranolol, and sertraline for the last ten years. He was opium-addicted and used 20 cc of daily methadone. At admission, he was confused and lethargic with normal vital signs except for high temperature (T = 38.5°C). Besides dehydration, other physical examinations did not reveal any positive findings. His blood sample was taken and showed a blood sugar of 500 mg/dl, pH of 7, and HCO<sub>3</sub> of 2.5 mEq/l. With the assumed diagnosis of DKA, insulin, tazocin, and serum therapy was initiated. The patient’s general condition and blood sugar levels were improved during the next day, and the HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration was raised to 9.5 mEq/l. On the third day of admission, his HCO<sub>3</sub> was 11 mEq/l. However, insulin infusion was held due to a lower potassium level. The patient suffered from dyspnea and shortness of breath on the next day and was connected to the ventilator. HRCT was requested, and the results were highly suggestive of COVID-19 infection . Additional laboratory data were as follows: potassium of 7 mEq/l, sodium of 138 mEq/l, LDH of 1296 U/L, CPK of 5130 U/L, phosphorus of 2 mg/dl, and Cr of 5.3 mg/dl.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Bilateral and peripheral ground-glass pulmonary opacities.</u>\n\n【17】Prompt therapeutic measurements were done, and because of decreased urine output, a temporary dialysis catheter was inserted, and he underwent hemodialysis. During the hospital admission, he experienced an attack of hypotension managed with norepinephrine as well as hydrocortisone. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed due to increased amylase (142 U/L) and lipase (351 U/L) levels. The findings of imaging studies and the analysis of ascites fluid favored pancreatitis 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. Moreover, this CT was highly suggestive of concurrent splenic vein thrombosis 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b))</u>. All appropriate therapies were implemented, and most of the laboratory data were improved consequently. The hemodialysis course was discontinued, and he was discharged from the hospital after the second abdominal CT examination indicated resolved signs of pancreatitis. On the 45th day, his general condition was good. He received insulin twice a day and daily orally administered warfarin with a dosage of 5 mg adjusted to keep the patient’s international normalized ratio (INR) value of over 2.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Heterogeneity and edema of the pancreatic tail with low enhancement (a) and splenic vein thrombosis with multiple collaterals (b).</u>\n\n【19】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【20】A 47-year-old woman came to the hospital with respiratory symptoms, including fever, cough, and dyspnea, for two weeks. She had a long history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and asthma, which had been medically controlled. Other vital signs were in normal ranges. She did not complain of muscle pain. Due to high suspicion for COVID-19 infection, she was tested, and the results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and HRCT were suggestive of this viral infection . She was transferred to the infectious ward. Her laboratory findings showed LDH of 5580 U/L, CPK of 16480 U/L, Cr of 1.7 mg/dl, AST of 951 IU/L, ALT of 874 IU/L, and ALP of 394 IU/L. With the assumed diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, serum therapy was prescribed. The shortness of breath worsened on the fifth day and resulted in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class of IV worsening cardiac function with severe hemoglobin oxygen desaturation due to bronchial secretions. Despite receiving 100% oxygen via a face mask, oxygen saturation only reached 80%. Therefore, the decision was made in order to intubate the patient. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and the proper treatments were continued. Her laboratory findings were improved during the next week (LDH: 1204 U/L, CPK: 560 U/L, Cr: 0.7 mg/dl, AST: 135 IU/L, ALT: 234 IU/L, and ALP: 562 IU/L). The patient remained stable hemodynamically; however, she became unable to wean from a ventilator secondary to probable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Unfortunately, in the third week, she had a sudden cardiac arrest. She underwent cardiorespiratory resuscitation but could not be resuscitated from her pulseless electrical activity arrest and died.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Multifocal multilobular consolidation and ground-glass opacities.</u>\n\n【22】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【23】Since the emergence of COVID-19, several other manifestations rather than pulmonary symptoms have been reported. Here, we presented three cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection with concomitant rhabdomyolysis as well as hypocalcemia and DKA. Rhabdomyolysis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by skeletal muscle cell breakdown and leakage of cellular components, including potassium, phosphorus, CPK, and myoglobin, to the bloodstream. The typical triad of this disease consisted of myalgia, weakness, and dark-colored urine. However, less than 10% of patients experienced the classic triad 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Multiple etiologies have been suggested, including drug side effects, trauma, autoimmune status, exertion, ischemia, and infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Common viral causes include influenza A and B, herpes simplex virus, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and enteroviruses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Even though our patients were not tested for other viral diseases, clinical status and laboratory data confirmed COVID-19 infection. While the exact pathophysiological mechanism attributed to rhabdomyolysis occurrence in COVID-19 infection has yet to be investigated, several theories have been declared. Due to the genomic similarity between SARS and COVID-19 and the ability of SARS to directly infect muscle cells, it probably seems that this new infective agent can infect myocytes. The formation of immune complexes and their deposition because of cross-reactivity between muscle cells and viral antigens might be responsible for muscular damage. Massive cytokine production and cytotoxic T-cell activation could be categorized as other possible causes in this regard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. On the other hand, other rare comanifestations of COVID-19-induced rhabdomyolysis must be considered. Case 1 was admitted with severe hypocalcemia as the initial presentation. Although the patient had myalgia and experienced seizure, which might be due to rhabdomyolysis complications, the direct virus effect for causing these presentations should be considered. Liu et al. performed a retrospective study to assess the predictive effect of hypocalcemia among patients with severe COVID-19. They figured out that 62.6% of patients had low calcium levels, which was associated with poorer outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Hypocalcemia is quite common in viral infections and among critically ill patients. The possible factors include malnutrition, decreased intestinal absorption of calcium, cell membrane damage due to hypoxia and calcium influx, vitamin D deficiency, or medication interaction. Moreover, serum calcium is mainly bound to albumin, and hypocalcemia could occur in favor of reduced albumin levels. However, cytokine production during COVID-19 infection is reported to inhibit PTH secretion, and impaired response to PTH might be responsible for the induction of hypocalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Several studies are required to evaluate the exact pathophysiological mechanism responsible for hypocalcemia among COVID-19-infected individuals. Overall, in our case, it seems that impaired response to PTH, malnutrition, and calcium influx were possible causes of hypocalcemia.\n\n【24】In terms of DKA that occurred in Case 2, several points should be considered. The infection itself might be responsible for the induction of DKA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Also, abnormal blood glucose has been reported to be associated with worse outcomes in the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the data are still limited, further investigations for the diagnosis of the exact mechanism are required. The Coronaviridae family has the tropism for both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells. Like SARS, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be a receptor for COVID-19 S-protein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This receptor has been expressed in pancreatic beta-cells in addition to pulmonary cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The primary role of ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin 2 to angiotensin1–7. Therefore, downregulation of the ACE2 receptor during COVID-19 leads to increased angiotensin 2 concentration resulting in reduced blood supply to pancreatic cells and subsequently delayed insulin secretion, which ultimately results in hyperglycemia and even DKA occurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. However, whether the sudden onset alterations of glucose metabolism in severe COVID-19 will be persisted or remitted is still unclear. The presence of this receptor on the exocrine pancreas might explain the incidence of pancreatitis in Case 2. It seems that pancreatic involvement during COVID-19 should be further addressed in clinical settings.\n\n【25】In conclusion, our findings from this case report indicate that rhabdomyolysis could be categorized as one of the complications of COVID-19, and further suspicion for proper diagnosis and therapeutic interventions should be performed. Furthermore, other simultaneous rare manifestations, including hypocalcemia or DKA, must be comprehensively addressed in future studies.\n\n【26】#### Abbreviations\n\n| COVID-19: | Coronavirus disease 2019 |\n| --- | --- |\n| SARS: | Severe acute respiratory syndrome |\n| MERS: | Middle East respiratory syndrome |\n| DKA: | Diabetic ketoacidosis |\n| HHS: | Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state |\n| ECG: | Electrocardiogram |\n| HRCT: | High-resolution computed tomography |\n| LDH: | Lactic acid dehydrogenase |\n| CPK: | Creatine phosphokinase |\n| AST: | Aspartate aminotransferase |\n| ALT: | Alanine aminotransferase |\n| ALP: | Alkaline phosphatase |\n| PTH: | Parathyroid hormone |\n| BUN: | Blood urea nitrogen |\n| Cr: | Creatinine |\n| CPR: | Cardiopulmonary resuscitation |\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| INR: | International normalized ratio |\n| RT-PCR: | Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction |\n| NYHA: | New York Heart Association |\n| ICU: | Intensive care unit |\n| ARDS: | Acute respiratory distress syndrome |\n| ACE2: | Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Case 1\n\n【6】A 45-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital in October 2004 because of fever (38,5°C for 3 weeks), sweats, arthralgias, and myalgias. She had lost 5 kg over a one-month period (30 kg at entry). She had no underlying diseases and was not taking medications or using alcohol or illicit drugs. There was no history of recent travel. At least 5 cats, including several kittens resided at her home. Physical examination was unremarkable; lymph nodes, liver, and spleen were not enlarged. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 7 mm/h. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 13 mg/L (normal range, 0–5 mg/L). The results of WBC count and liver function tests were normal. Cultures of blood samples and urine were sterile.\n\n【7】She developed right upper-quadrant abdominal pain and nausea. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated multiple hypodense areas within the splenic and liver parenchyma. Results of serology for B. henselae (indirect immunofluorescence antibody IFA) were positive for IgG (512; normal <256) and positive for IgM. Treatment with ciprofloxacin (400 mg/day IV) and gentamicin (100 mg/day IV) was started. Clinical improvement was noted. After ten days of parenteral treatment, she was treated with ciprofloxacin (1000 mg/day PO) and doxycycline (200 mg/day PO) for three weeks. At one month, a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated mild improvement. Convalescent-phase serum samples obtained on month one were positive for IgG 通用删除7(英):<u>(1024)</u> and IgM, and on month three were positive for IgG 通用删除7(英):<u>(1024)</u> but negative for IgM.

He had lost 7 kg over a one-month period (88 kg). Before entry, he has been treated with pristinamycin 3 g/day unsuccessfully; and pulmonary radiography and thoracic CT scan yielded normal results. He had no underlying diseases and was not taking medications or using alcohol or illicit drugs. There was no history of recent travel. He had a young dog, but no cats. Physical examination was unremarkable; lymph nodes, liver, and spleen were not enlarged. ESR was 32 mm/h. CRP was 94 mg/L. The results of WBC count and liver function tests were normal. Cultures of blood samples and urine were sterile. Serologic testing were negative for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses A, B, and C, HIV, Rickettsia, Coxiella, Legionella, Yersinia, and Brucella species. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated multiple hypodense areas within the liver parenchyma, celiac lymphadenopathy, and homogeneous splenomegaly. Results of serology for B. henselae (IFA) were positive for IgG (2048; normal <256) and positive for IgM. Treatment with ciprofloxacin (400 mg/day IV) and gentamicin (160 mg/day IV) was started. Clinical improvement was noted. After ten days of parenteral treatment, he was treated with ciprofloxacin (1500 mg/day PO) and erythromycin (2000 mg/day PO) for three weeks. At one month, a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated mild improvement. Convalescent-phase serum samples obtained on month one were positive for IgG 通用删除7(英):<u>(2048)</u> and IgM, and on month four were positive for IgG 通用删除7(英):<u>(1024)</u> but negative for IgM. A CT scan of the abdomen at four months was normal.\n\n【10】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【11】A 33-year-old man was admitted to the hospital in October 2005 because of intermittent fever (39,5°C for three weeks) associated with abdominal pain. He had no underlying diseases and was not taking medications or using alcohol or illicit drugs. There was no history of recent travel. He had two cats, but he could not recall recent bites or scratches from these animals. Physical examination was unremarkable; lymph nodes, liver, and spleen were not enlarged. ESR was 41 mm/h. CRP was 140 mg/L. The results of WBC count and liver function tests were normal. Cultures of blood samples and urine were sterile. Serologic testing were negative for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses A, B, and C, HIV, Rickettsia, Coxiella, Legionella, and Brucella species. Echocardiography yielded normal results. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated three hypodense areas within the spleen parenchyma without splenomegaly and multiple celiac lymphadenopathy. A serum sample tested using an IFA assay to detect antibodies reactive with B. henselae was positive for IgG (2048; normal <256) and positive for IgM. Fever resolved spontaneously. However, treatment with doxycycline (200 mg/day PO) was started, and he was treated for three weeks. At one month, a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated mild improvement. Convalescent-phase serum samples obtained on month three were positive for IgG 通用删除7(英):<u>(1024)</u> but negative for IgM. A CT scan of the abdomen at three months showed regression of lymphadenopathy and a normal spleen.\n\n【12】##### 2.4. Case 4\n\n【13】A 71-year-old man was admitted to the hospital in January 2009 because of fever of unknown origin (39°C for four weeks) associated with fatigue and night sweats. He had lost 4 kg over a one-month period (66 kg). He was treated for arterial hypertension and diabetes. He had two cats and described recent scratches from these animals. Physical examination was unremarkable; lymph nodes, liver, and spleen were not enlarged. ESR was 88 mm/h. CRP was 55 mg/L. The results of WBC count and liver function tests were normal. Cultures of blood samples and urine were sterile. Serologic testing were negative for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses B and C, HIV, Rickettsia, Coxiella, Legionella, and Brucella species. Echocardiography yielded normal results. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated disseminated hypodense areas within the spleen parenchyma with mild splenomegaly  and hypodense areas within the hepatic parenchyma. A serum sample tested using an IFA assay to detect antibodies reactive with B. henselae was positive for IgG (4096; normal <256) and positive for IgM. Fever resolved spontaneously, but treatment with doxycyline (200 mg/day PO) and rifampin (600 mg/day PO) was started. He was treated for three weeks with favourable outcome.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Multiple hypodense areas within the spleen parenchyma. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】B. henselae is a small gram-negative bacteria that can produce two entirely different pathologic reactions, depending on the immune status of the host: CSD, which is characterized by granulomatous nonangiogenic inflammation, and angiogenesis, in which a neutrophilic inflammatory response to bacilli located within the skin, bone, and other organs (bacillary angiomatosis) or the liver and spleen (peliosis) is seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Typically, CSD begins with a localized papule that appears 3–5 days after a cat scratch and progresses into a pustule. Tender regional lymphadenopathy develops within 1-2 weeks after inoculation. Most patients with typical CSD remain afebrile and are not systematically ill throughout the course of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. CSD occurs primarily in children and young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although, recent data suggest that CSD may be more common among adults than previously thought.\n\n【17】Some immunocompetent patients may have atypical CSD (systemic B. henselae infections), with prolonged fever (longer than three weeks), myalgia, arthralgia, and skin eruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Hepatic lesions with or without splenic lesions on ultrasonography and CT have been reported in children, and rarely in adults. Hepatosplenic involvement can be found even in patients, particularly children, with typical CSD without apparent systemic manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Isolated splenic CSD is extremely rare, and only a few cases have been reported to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 9–11\\]</u>. A case of spontaneous splenic rupture as a consequence of disseminated B. henselae infection has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In many reports, the diagnosis was obtained after splenectomy had been performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10, 11\\]</u>. In the case described by Ghez and coll. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, the diagnosis of CSD was established by serological testing for B. henselae and splenectomy was not performed, as in our cases. Splenic CSD can easily be mistaken for splenic lymphoma, thereby leading to unnecessary splenectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Bartonella serology must be achieved in case of hepatosplenic nodules with fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【19】A careful clinical history researching an intimate contact with a kitten associated with a specific serology and an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan for hepatosplenic involvement may follow a rapid and accurate diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Radiologic features of ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are not specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Treatment of disseminated CSD in immunocompetent adult is still empirical and recovery can occur without antibiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In the recent pediatric survey of Scolfaro and coll. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>, macrolides or a combination of two active antibiotics for two or three weeks leads to a rapid clinical response. Macrolides (erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline are frequently recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Rifampin and gentamicin were used in the treatment of hepatosplenic CSD in children in the survey reported by Arisoy and coll 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In our 2 first cases, patients had febrile illness; so we used parenteral gentamicin before switching to oral therapy. In the third case, the patient did not appear acutely ill; fever spontaneously resolved; so he was treated only with oral monotherapy. The condition of many patients improves without antibiotics. Some cases may show improvement with antibiotic therapy, but it is not clear how much or how much more quickly the improvement is with therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In the recommendations published in 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, the combination of doxycycline (100 mg PO or IV twice daily) with rifampin (300 mg PO twice daily) is proposed for treatment of complicated CSD. It was our choice in case 4. The optimum duration of antibiotic therapy for immunocompetent patients with complicated CSD has not been determined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】From the observation of four cases of systemic B. henselae infection between 2004 and 2009, epidemiological consequences such as underestimation in fever of unknown origin cannot be derived. However, the frequency of liver and/or splenic involvement in CSD is probably underestimated. An accurate clinical history and a reasonably wide use of the serological test may allow a rapid and accurate diagnosis, reassuring the patient and avoiding invasive and expensive diagnostic procedures, such as liver biopsy or laparotomy with splenectomy. The aim of this paper is to inform the reader that one should include systemic B. henselae into the differential diagnosis in cases of fever of unknown origin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

They represent a potential source of clinically significant bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal system in patients with cirrhosis. As this particular ulcer entity in relation to PHD has no distinguishing symptoms aside from those relating to the consequent bleeding, most of them are found either on routine endoscopic screening for cirrhotics or on endoscopic examination for cause(s) of bleeding in this patient population. The case documented below highlights many of the aspects of pathogenesis, associations, and consequences of this unique endoscopic finding in cirrhotic patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Portal hypertensive duodenopathy is a known association of portal hypertension. It is clinically significant as it has potential for being a source of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Hence, it could bear important consequences on mortality and morbidity in this condition.\n\n【4】Scientific literature documents that multiple ulcerations in the duodenum is a finding in this condition. But this finding is uncommon. We detail a case of a 42-year-old Nigerian man with alcohol-related decompensated cirrhotic liver disease who had previously undergone multiple endoscopic variceal ligation sessions for esophageal varices who now presents with features of repeated upper gastrointestinal bleeding and was found to have two distinct ulcers in his duodenal cap—“kissing ulcers”.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 42-year-old clerk presented with a history of progressive weakness and an episode of loss of consciousness. Thirteen months earlier, the gentleman had been diagnosed with alcohol-related decompensated chronic liver disease but had not adhered to the prescribed abstinence from alcohol.\n\n【7】About two months prior to presentation, he was diagnosed with grade 3 esophageal varices which had required 2 sessions of endoscopic band ligation (EBL)—each session was one month apart from the other and the latest EBL session was about four weeks prior to this presentation. Presently, the patient reported that he had become increasingly weak after the initial improvement he noted following the second EBL session, his stools had become dark and tarry, and that he had an episode of loss of consciousness which lasted a few seconds. He denied using steroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Following the last EBL session, his weekly packed cell volume values were: 29%, 28%, 29%, and 22%-the last one was done 12 hours before presentation. Other laboratory findings put him in Child-Pugh class B.\n\n【8】The vital signs revealed a pulse rate of 124 beats per minute which was low volume and his blood pressure was 98/64 mmHg. His examination findings were significant for dyspnea at rest (respiratory rate was 28 cycles per minute), pallor, and the digital rectal examination revealed black stools.\n\n【9】After stabilization, he underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed enlarged but straight varices (grade 1) . No features of PHG were noted. The duodenal mucosal lining was erythematous and edematous. There were two duodenal ulcers noted on the walls in the first part—“kissing ulcers” 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>. The ulcer on the anterior wall was about 5 mm by 4 mm while the one on the posterior wall was smaller- 2 mm by 3 mm. They were both circular and their bases were filled with whitish exudates, while the larger of the two ulcers had evidence of recent bleeding in the presence of multiple blood clots at its base. The histopathology report of the biopsies taken showed subepithelial edema and dilation of mucosal/submucosal capillary vessels with strikingly minimal inflammatory changes. Helicobacter pylori could not be demonstrated.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Endoscopy of esophagus showing the grade 1 (enlarged but straight) varices. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | (a) Endoscopic view of the duodenum showing the ulcer on its anterior wall. (b) Endoscopic view of duodenum showing the ulcer on its posterior wall. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】The session was completed with EBL for the varices seen and the patient was discharged in stable clinical condition. Medical management of the condition was reinstituted and he was referred for a liver transplant. He was lost to followup shortly thereafter.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Portal hypertension (PH) is known to be associated with the development of mucosal changes in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT)—the so called “congestive gastroenteropathy” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> or “portal hypertensive syndrome” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. By far the most dreaded of these changes is the development of esophageal varices with their clinically devastating consequence of GIT bleeding. McCormack et al. in 1985 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> gave a detailed pathological description of gastric mucosal abnormalities associated with PH. Thereafter, it has been shown that PH changes can affect all parts of the GIT and the entities have since acquired names according to the regions involved—portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, duodenopathy (PHD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, enteropathy (PHE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>, and colonopathy (PHC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【15】A consensus definition of PHD is not available at this time but various workers have considered many endoscopic and histological features to be consistent with a diagnosis of the disease. These endoscopic findings can be classified after Barakat et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> as (a) mucosal erythema (patchy or diffuse), (b) mucosal edema, (c) mucosal breaks (erosions or ulcers), and (d) vascular lesions (varices or telangiectasia). Other rare lesions such as duodenal polyps have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Vascular changes dominate as the main histologic feature characterizing this portal congestive process—they include both capillary congestion/dilatation and capillary angiogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11\\]</u>. Along with capillary changes are fibrous proliferation and increased apoptosis, all in a background of absent/minimal inflammatory cells. The presence or otherwise of villous atrophy is still controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Interestingly, it has been shown that endoscopically normal duodenal mucosa does not preclude the histological changes of PHD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The rare finding of multiple duodenal ulcers in cirrhotics has only been documented in a handful of published works 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The endoscopic findings in this index case represent, to the best of authors’ knowledge, the first time this is being documented from our local environment. The histological report from the index patient was most consistent with the endoscopist’s diagnosis of PHD.\n\n【17】The clinical importance of PHD derives from the fact that it is a recognized cause of occult or overt bleeding. Bleeding is more commonly related to erosions and/or ulcers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> but erythematous duodenopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and even polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> have been reported to cause bleeding as well. Though bleeding can be severe and require intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 13, 14\\]</u>, fortunately, most episodes of overt bleeding are self-limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Our patient’s case highlights this fact as his was severe bleeding with associated cardiovascular compromise and yet at had become quiescent at EGD and required no further intervention.\n\n【18】Ever since the awareness of the disease had been created, several attempts have been made to correlate the presence and severity of PHD to various factors such as severity and etiology of liver disease, manifestations of PH in other sites of the gastrointestinal tract, a history of upper gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, and so forth, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 15\\]</u>. Interestingly, there has not been shown any significant relationship between the presence nor severity of PHD lesions with the severity nor etiology of liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 15, 16\\]</u>. In the index case, grade 1 esophageal varices were seen along with the double duodenal ulcers while these were absent when he had a worse grade of esophageal varices. His Child-Pugh (CP) score had also been downgraded with prior instituted management. He was CP class B as at presentation and this was the first time that PHD was being noted.\n\n【19】Data concerning the relationship of presence and severity of PHD with previous attempts at esophageal variceal eradication has been conflicting-scientific literature bearing studies that both support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 17\\]</u> and refute it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 15, 18\\]</u>. But a 2010 work from Egypt represents the most detailed and specifically designed prospective study that examined this puzzling question 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The results were in the affirmative as the paper showed that PHE changes (PHD included) increased in frequency and severity after esophageal variceal obliteration. The case detailed here bears witness to this as our patient showed no PHD features till he had had 2 prior sessions of EBL.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】This report highlights the fact that multiple duodenal ulcerations are a feature of PHD and further underscores the need for adherence to international standards for the care of all cirrhotics by carrying out regular periodic EGDs to access for such mucosal abnormalities as this. The authors note that this is easier said than done in a resource limited environment like ours on account of EGD-related limitations in availability, affordability, accessibility, and scarcity of relevant expertise. We also note the usefulness of intubation of the duodenum as a relevant and necessary component of EGD particularly in patients with liver disease—this becomes even more pressing in those that have undergone interventions for PHD-related lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It usually involves the suprapatellar pouch of the knee joint. It is not a neoplasm but is rather considered a nonspecific reactive response to chronic synovial irritation, due to either mechanical or inflammatory insults. We report three cases of lipoma arborescens affecting the knee, the first in a young male without previous history of arthritis or trauma, the second in a 58-year-old male associated with osteoarthritis, and the final in a 44-year-old male diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, which cover the entire pathologic spectrum of this unusual entity. We highlight the clinical findings and imaging features, by emphasizing especially the role of MRI, in the differential diagnosis of other, more complex intra-articular masses.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Synovium is an uncommon site for primary tumors and most of them are benign. Lipoma arborescens (LA) is one of them.

Case Presentations\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Patient 1\n\n【7】A 30-year-old man, army officer, presented with a 2-year history of slowly progressive swelling of his right knee. The patient complained of night knee pain that woke him up. He also stated that while knee swelling was growing, pain was reducing. He did not report prior trauma, surgery, or infection in his knee.\n\n【8】On clinical examination, there was painless, diffuse swelling in the suprapatellar area. The knee had full range of motion and showed no signs of meniscal lesions, nor anteroposterior and collateral instability.\n\n【9】All laboratory studies were normal.\n\n【10】Plain radiographs depicted an area of dense soft tissue in the suprapatellar pouch. The femur and tibia were normal, with normal joint space.\n\n【11】CT revealed a low-density intra-articular mass, similar to fat, with multiple villi, surrounded by joint fluid causing distention of the joint capsule.

After intravenous (iv) administration of gadolinium, enhancement of the overlying synovium was observed, with no enhancement of the underlying fat .

Patient 2\n\n【23】A 58-year-old male presented with a 4-year history swelling and mild pain in both knees, especially in the right. The patients’ previous history was free of trauma, fever, or morning stiffness. No other joints were affected.\n\n【24】Clinical examination showed fullness in the suprapatellar and parapatellar regions of both knees. The swelling was more obvious in the right knee, with tenderness in the medial joint line. The cruciate and collateral ligaments as well as the menisci were intact clinically.\n\n【25】The patient was investigated for rheumatoid factor, serum uric acid, antinuclear antibody, and anti-dsDNA, apart from the routine blood examinations. All findings were normal.\n\n【26】X-rays established the diagnosis of osteoarthritis, with joint space narrowing and osteophytes on both knees, more pronounced on the right.\n\n【27】MRI of the right knee demonstrated severe medial compartment osteoarthritis, with marginal osteophytes, chondral lesions, subchondral changes, and a complex tear of the medial meniscus. Mild, villous, frond-like fatty subsynovial hyperplasia was present in the suprapatellar bursa, associated with joint effusion and synovial proliferation, which enhanced after iv administration of gadolinium.

Arthroscopic examination of the knee revealed a large amount of yellowish frond-like projections in the suprapatellar pouch, with degenerative changes of the cartilage in the medial and lateral compartment. Synovium was meticulously excised from the suprapatellar pouch and the medial and lateral gutter. Retropatellar fat pad was debrided as well.\n\n【30】Histopathological examination of the tissue revealed fibrous tissue and adipose cells in the subsynovial region, which were responsible for villous dilatation. The villi were covered by hyperplastic inflamed synovium.\n\n【31】The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient returned to his previous level of activity without restriction in the range of movement. There was no recurrence during a twenty-month follow-up period.\n\n【32】##### 2.3. Patient 3\n\n【33】A 44-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of pain and swelling in his right knee and feet. He did not report prior trauma or surgery in the affected knee.\n\n【34】Clinical examination disclosed a large amount of knee joint effusion, with restriction of knee movement. Skin examination demonstrated psoriatic plaques and ichthyosis. Blood tests showed C-reactive protein of 10 mg/l and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 20 mm/h. Antinuclear antibody and anti-dsDNA screen, as well as rheumatoid factor, were negative. The rest of the laboratory findings were unremarkable.\n\n【35】A needle aspiration produced 500 ml of aseptic fluid, containing high numbers of mixed leucocyte populations.\n\n【36】Plain radiographs depicted an area of dense soft tissue in the suprapatellar pouch of the right knee. The femur and tibia were normal, with preservation of the joint space without cortical erosions.\n\n【37】Tc-99m scintigraphy revealed persistent concentration of the technetium in the right knee joint, which was indicative of inflammation.

A yellowish villous mass was removed from the suprapatellar pouch and the medial and lateral gutter. Synovium was carefully excised from the pouch, the retropatellar fat pad, and Hoffa’s fat pad.\n\n【44】Histological assessment of LA tissue disclosed frondose areas with significant neovascularization, dense cellular infiltrates, and connective tissue with mature adipocytes.\n\n【45】The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient returned to his previous level of activity with improvement in the range of knee flexion. There was no recurrence up to 18 months after surgery.\n\n【46】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【47】LA is an unusual, intra-articular, benign lesion of synovium. The first detailed case report was by Arzimanoglu in 1957 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Since then, less than 100 have been reported according to Kamaci et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Most reports consist of just one case or a small series of this unusual lipoma, while Howe and Wenger described the largest series with 45 lesions in 39 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【48】Its etiology and pathogenesis are unknown. A history of trauma is reported in many patients with LA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Diabetes mellitus or steroid use have also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Lesions due to either degenerative or inflammatory arthritis are seen quite often, as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 9–11\\]</u>. Indeed, Howe and Wenger reported the presence of arthritic chondral damage at 36 of their 39 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Moreover, late treatment is related to early development of osteoarthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【49】According to Kloen et al. a typical patient with LA is an adult in the fourth or fifth decade of his life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Men and women are equally affected. Howe and Wenger describe unilateral knee involvement as typical, while atypical cases include both knees or involvement of other joints, such as shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip and ankle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7, 13–16\\]</u>. Patients complain of chronic, progressive, painless swelling of the involved joint. Effusion is almost always present, but limitations in range of movement and pain are not seen very often 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 13, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【50】Blood tests are normal and plain radiographs may show soft tissue density in the suprapatellar pouch when the knee is involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>.\n\n【51】MRI is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice and can demonstrate variable morphological patterns with pathognomonic characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 19\\]</u>. A large frond-like mass arising from the synovium is seen, with signal intensity similar to fat on all pulse sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–22\\]</u>. Alternatively, multiple villous proliferation of the synovium and fatty-appearing globules can be seen, while a mixed pattern can also appear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Although the subsynovial tissue does not enhance after iv administration of contrast medium, the synovial lining and the joint fluid may demonstrate enhancement, related to the presence of inflammatory cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Finally, the absence of magnetic susceptibility artifacts attributable to hemosiderin is also characteristic and useful in the differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【52】Although LA has characteristic features that usually make it a straightforward MRI diagnosis, other entities presenting as filling defects in the suprapatellar recess, such that osseous loose bodies, synovial chondromatosis, “rice bodies” accompanying rheumatoid arthritis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, quadriceps fat pad impingement, synovial hemangioma, intra-articular lipoma, and intra-articular liposarcoma may mimic LA and cause confusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>.\n\n【53】Macroscopically, LA appears as a yellowish synovial proliferation, with broad villous projections of fatty tissue arranged in an arborescent pattern, usually filling the suprapatellar pouch and both gutters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 25\\]</u>. Histologically, massive infiltration of the synovium by mature adipose cells is characteristic for LA. Enlarged hyperaemic capillaries and focal chronic inflammatory infiltration is usually observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【54】Although our first patient is a typical LA patient regarding age and MR imaging findings, his symptoms and clinical signs at time of presentation were quite atypical. A painful knee swelling is not so common in patients with LA. It is also very unusual that our patient’s knee was becoming less painful as swelling was progressing, a characteristic that has not been mentioned in other painful LAs. Moreover, night knee pain that awakens the patient has not been described in the literature so far being more commonly associated with bone sarcomas with an incidence ranging from 20 to 44% and may mislead to false diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26, 27\\]</u>.\n\n【55】The third case presented here is extremely rare and refers to unilateral LA in a patient with psoriatic arthritis. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two cases reported in the literature referring to concurrent psoriatic arthritis with LA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28, 29\\]</u>. However, in our patient, the MRI appearance is very unusual, with innumerable individual villi and with small quantities of interposed fluid, creating a feathery appearance. Areas of hypertrophic synovium with little or no fat deposition were also present. When LA develops in patients with chronic synovitis, as in this patient with psoriatic arthritis, areas of synovial thickening without fat deposition are often encountered.\n\n【56】LA is a benign tumor. Malignancy has not been reported, so biopsy is not regarded by some authors as an essential part of treatment algorithm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 25, 30, 31\\]</u>. However, considering the small number of cases with LA that have been described in the literature so far, as well as the fact that the pathology of this entity has not been clarified up till now, we believe that biopsy may be useful in selected cases. Recommended treatment is open synovectomy and recurrence after surgery is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 30\\]</u>. Arthroscopic synovectomy is also described in recent case reports, with comparable rates of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 30, 32\\]</u>. Chemical synovectomy with Yttrium has been used for temporal relief of the symptoms, but not as the definitive treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【57】When synovectomy is delayed more than a year from symptoms onset, early osteoarthritis may develop 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. One of the largest case series showed osteoarthritic signs two years postoperatively in all patients treated with a delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【58】Finally, although MRI with iv administration of gadolinium is extremely useful diagnostically, the definite diagnosis can only be established by histological examination, which reveals diffuse replacement of the subsynovial tissue with mature fat cells, causing villous expansion of the synovium, and inflammatory cells around capillaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 33\\]</u>.\n\n【59】In conclusion, LA is a relatively uncommon benign lesion, which typically affects knee joint, especially the suprapatellar pouch. It should always be considered in the spectrum of differential diagnosis when clinicians deal with chronic swelling, either painful or painless, of a joint. MRI findings are characteristic and early synovectomy offers the best functional outcome.\n\n【60】#### Competing Interests\n\n【61】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The oral cavity is rarely affected by this infestation and the circumstances which can lead to oral myiasis include persistent mouth opening together with poor hygiene, or facial traumatism. We present a case of oral myiasis by larvae of Lucilia sericata, a species present in the Iberian Peninsula, in a hospitalized patient with surgical problems.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case History\n\n【3】A male aged 32 years was admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from General Surgery in a tertiary hospital (Hospital Virgen del Puerto, Plasencia, Extremadura, Spain). Case history revealed intestinal pathology with peritonitis, and laparotomy with intestinal resection, approximately a year previously. Two months before, the patient presented a new subocclusive condition, with gastroparesis, esophageal motor disorder, and intestinal myopathy. The patient was admitted to surgery with pain in the left iliac fossa compatible with acute peritonitis and perforation of the hollow viscus. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and the affected intestinal loops were resected. Two days later a further surgical intervention was necessary because of feverish syndrome and abdominal distension. During this period the patient remained under the effects of sedation. Abscesses and peritonitis with intestinal block were found, which prompted the patient’s transfer to ICU. After 12 h in ICU a further intervention due to biliary peritonitis was required; the omentum was seen to be invaded by abscesses, requiring it to resected, a jejunostomy was performed, and the abdomen was left open. Antibiotherapy was administered contributing to improve the patient’s evolution, with diminished fever and signs of inflammation. In the evolutionary period of 15 days following admission, the nurse reported mobile “maggots” in the patient’s oral cavity, nasopharynx and oropharynx, and the presence of perilarval reaction. Treatment consisted of total mechanical removal of the larvae by combining manual extraction with tweezers and aspiration after having washed the infected area with water and povidone iodine. The patient’s clinical condition was controlled without the appearance of further signs of infestation.\n\n【4】Several fly larvae were sent to the laboratory, white in color, without legs, and with a smooth surface . The larvae presented 12 segments: the first of which had a pair of lateral papillae (anterior spiracles) with digitiform prolongations; the last segment having D-shaped posterior spiracles with 3 straight perimetral slots, not sinuous, and dark in color. The perimetral membrane is closed with a button which is especially evident when observed with low microscopic magnification (10x). These structures led us to identify this larva as part of the Calliphoridae family, belonging to the genus Lucilia.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Aspect and evolution of the larvae of Lucilia sericata in our laboratory.

The larva moved freely in the agar, and after about 10 days a dark brown structure appeared stuck on the edge of the plaque. This pupa was placed on a clean petri plate at room temperature. After a few days, the adult insect or imago appeared. Based on its subcostal sclerite, which was yellow in color, its meron structure, and the analysis of its wing venation, it was identified as Lucilia sericata, a species present in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【8】Insects such as dipterans may infest animals and humans, causing myiasis infection by fly larvae with multiple localizations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. The larvae need to feed on live or dead tissues in order to grow and mutate. Although it is a well-known illness in the veterinary field, it is infrequent in man, being more frequent in the Tropics, with rare occurrences in warm zones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Oral myiasis is a rare process in developed countries, but can occur anywhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It has been associated with poor oral hygiene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>, open bite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, neurological deficit or psychiatric disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7\\]</u>, alcoholism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and other disorders. In the episode described here the species involved was L. sericata which is distributed worldwide; this species is also known as the green bottle fly and sheep blowfly strike. Nosocomial myiasis, which occurs in a patient following hospitalization, is a very infrequent phenomenon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Most reports of nosocomial myiasis have been of sporadic infestations, particularly in debilitated patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Factors contributing to nosocomial myasis include hypoesthesia or disturbed consciousness, which prevents the patient’s sensation of fly contact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, or paralysis that can prevent a patient from fending off a fly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【10】In this case, we believe that a sedated patient lying with his mouth half-open, in a rural hospital surrounded by pasturelands, could explain the entrance of flies into his oral cavity and the laying of eggs which hatched when the patient was in Intensive Care.\n\n【11】Myasis generates great anxiety, in both the patient and custodial personnel.

Autologous bone grafting to the nonunion site was performed at the same hospital 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(d))</u>. Cancellous bone was harvested from the iliac crest and grafted.

Discussion\n\n【10】Breakage of a gamma nail is a relatively rare complication, and the reported incidence ranges from 0.2 to 5.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–9\\]</u>. The location of the nail breakage was reported mainly at the level of the aperture of the lag screw and at the distal screw hole, followed by the nail shaft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–9\\]</u>. In our case the nail breakage occurred at the distal screw hole.\n\n【11】The tragic chain of events in this case was caused by previous inappropriate surgery, which apparently caused the nail breakage. At the initial surgery, fracture reduction was not obtained and a large gap continued to exist between the fragments, however, the insertion of the nail was performed and interlocked with two distal screws. There was no bony contact between the fragments. The previous surgeon then performed autologous bone grafting to the fracture gap at the second surgery without revision of the implant. However replacement of the gamma nail was indicated when making attempts at gap reduction during the second surgery. Moreover, a long gamma nail was also indicated in the initial surgery because the fracture was in the subtrochanteric area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 10–12\\]</u>. No bony contact led to excessive stress to the hardware. Weight bearing was transmitted from the proximal fragment directly to the nail and the distal locking screw. Therefore, we suggest the nail broke due to metal fatigue at the location with the strongest stress.\n\n【12】Replacing the nail and autologous bone grafting was effective for salvage surgery. A longer nail was selected to fix the segmental fracture. A long gamma nail is commonly used for treatment of subtrochanteric fracture and its effectiveness has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 10–12\\]</u>. Additionally, Barquet et al. reported a good clinical result in the treatment of subtrochanteric nonunion with long gamma nails 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. We predicted the fresh fracture would heal by fixation; however, the nonunion site located above the fresh fracture site was long standing and thought to be biologically less active. Therefore, we supplemented with autologous bone grafting at the nonunion site.\n\n【13】Patient-dependent risk factors for nonunion include various medical comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, vascular disease), advanced age, smoking, alcohol abuse, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, nutritional deficiency, radiation treatment, genetic disorders, and metabolic disease or endocrine pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This patient had accompanying chronic renal failure and had been treated by hemodialysis for 40 years. There is no comprehensive study describing the relationship between nonunion and chronic renal failure/hemodialysis. However, Karaeminogullari et al. reported the high incidence of nonunion in surgically treated hip fractures in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. We cannot declare that the chronic renal failure/hemodialysis impaired the fracture healing, however, it is possible that the chronic renal failure/hemodialysis affected this patient’s fracture healing. This patient was 73-year-old; therefore the advanced age possibly affected the impaired fracture healing.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】We present a rare patient with breakage of gamma nail accompanied by nonunion of the original fracture and a subsequent new fracture in the ipsilateral femur. This case confirms our understanding that appropriate reduction and fixation is important in fracture surgery. Replacing the nail to a longer nail and autologous bone grafting were effective as salvage surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

As class III obesity leads to hip joint deterioration, black women frequently present for orthopedic care. Weight loss associated with bariatric surgery should lead to enhanced success of hip replacements. However, we present a case of a black woman who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with the expectation that weight loss would make her a better surgical candidate for hip replacement. Her gastric bypass was successful as her BMI declined from 52.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. However, her hip circumference after weight loss remained persistently high. Therefore, at surgery the soft tissue tunnel geometry presented major challenges. Tunnel depth and immobility of the soft tissue interfered with retractor placement, tissue reflection, and surgical access to the acetabulum. Therefore a traditional cup placement could not be achieved. Instead, a hemiarthroplasty was performed. After surgery her pain and reliance on external support decreased. But her functional independence never improved. This case demonstrates that a lower BMI after bariatric surgery may improve the metabolic profile and decrease anesthesia risk, but the success of total hip arthroplasties remains problematic if fat mass in the operative field (i.e. high hip circumference) remains high.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】According to NHANES 2009-2010, the prevalence of class III obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in black, white, Hispanic, and Mexican American women is 18.0%, 7.3%, 6.1%, and 6.7%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. For men, the prevalence also varies by ethnicity but is lower than 8% in all groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Due to their high rate of obesity, black women are highly likely to come to the attention of orthopedic surgeons after bariatric surgery for hip replacement. Bariatric surgery is associated with many benefits including the eradication or improvement of hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and obstructive sleep apnea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. All of these metabolic changes lead to decreased risk of anesthesia and postsurgical metabolic complications. But in our urban orthopedic clinic, we are observing persistently high hip circumferences in black women, even after major weight loss (MMM). Therefore we frequently encounter an unpublished and unexpected orthopedic risk: inadequate loss of subcutaneous fat in the operative field. To demonstrate the challenges, a representative case is presented.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】With the expectation that her back and hip pain would resolve, a 51-year-old black woman, with a BMI of 52.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Within three years she achieved a BMI of 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. At this lower BMI, she reported that her back pain had improved but due to persistent severe right hip pain, her ability to ambulate remained compromised. She requested surgical relief.\n\n【6】At her preoperative orthopedic evaluation, she had a Harris Hip Score of 17, and even though her BMI was 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, her hip circumference was proportionately much higher. Preoperative photographs of her with a BMI of 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were not taken. Photographs from 3 years later when her BMI had increased to 42.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> have been obtained . At the time these photographs were taken, her waist and hip circumferences were 107 cm and 155 cm, respectively. Her overall proportions with a BMI of 42.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were visually similar to her preorthopedic surgery measurements when her BMI was 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | 51-year-old black woman with BMI of 42.0 kg/m2 after bariatric surgery, waist circumference of 107 cm, and hip circumference of 155 cm. (a) Seated anterior view. (b) Profile standing. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】Due to her high hip circumference, minimally invasive techniques were not an option. The massive soft tissue mass in the surgical field totally obstructed bony landmarks and precluded both computer and image navigation techniques. She underwent a 4-hour operation during which extensile incisions were utilized to improve access and component positioning. Due to the 15 cm depth of the soft tissue tunnel, combined with the inability to reflect the soft tissue flaps, a traditional cup placement could not be achieved. Therefore, instead of the more optimal total hip replacement, a hemiarthroplasty was performed. Postoperatively, a chronically draining wound which took months to stabilize occurred.\n\n【9】Nonetheless she had transient improvement in hip score. However, her ambulation at 1 and 3 years after hemiarthroplasty was only minimally improved and she is categorized as housebound ambulatory with a Harris Hip Score of 18.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】For the woman presented, bariatric surgery was successful in achieving weight loss so that BMI declined from 52.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. However, her persistently high hip circumference left her with the same technical challenges during hip replacement surgery as if she had not undergone the weight loss intervention. Even with a BMI in the category of class I obese, her body fat distribution was such that a total hip replacement could not be accomplished. Due to the size, shape, and mobility of the soft tissues in the operative field, adequate exposure and access to the acetabular component were not achievable.\n\n【12】This case raises awareness that neither absolute weight nor BMI is sufficient to define whether the subsequent orthopedic risks have been minimized. Attention needs to be paid to the mass of fat in the operative field. Importantly, this large mass of subcutaneous fat can be predicted preoperatively by simply measuring hip circumference and performing hip axial imaging by CT . Consistent with our clinical experience, the importance of hip circumference as a way to predict high body fat content has recently been validated. The ratio of hip circumference to height known as the Body Adiposity Index (BAI), has been shown to be superior to BMI as a measure of body fat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> (Body Adiposity Index = (hip circumference/(height<sup>1.5</sup>)) − 18).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | CT imaging to demonstrate soft tissue geometry and gravitational changes with position.

These scans are presented as an example and are from a black woman with BMI of 45.0 kg/m2. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【14】Overall, this case presentation has special relevance for black women. Women have more subcutaneous fat than men and black women have more subcutaneous fat than white women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Therefore even after successful weight loss black women are likely to continue to have a relatively high volume of subcutaneous fat. To optimize orthopedic outcomes related to total hip replacement, surgeons need to evaluate patients independent of BMI for this possibility and plan accordingly. At this time, bariatric and orthopedic surgeons focus on BMI rather than hip circumference.\n\n【15】We bring this issue forth because there appears to be an absence of appreciation of this issue. A literature search led us to the identification of only two articles discussing hip replacement surgery following bariatric surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Both of these articles described the benefits of bariatric surgery and neither addressed the orthopedic issues we describe. Because extensive fat in the surgical field is so commonly encountered in our practice, we have developed modifications that have been helpful (MMM) . We appreciate the limitations in waist and hip circumference measurements being made 3 years following her hip replacement surgery. However her body mass distribution, including her pear shaped body habitus, was preserved allowing for some of the observations and recommendations we have made. We hope this case presentation will lead to improved outcomes and bring attention to the need to focus not just on BMI but also hip circumference when considering the options for hip arthroplasty.\n\n【16】Table 1 Modifications to consider for hip arthroplasty with high hip circumference.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We describe a case of TTP which presented as an ischemic stroke. The patient presented with stroke as the primary manifestation of TTP despite a normal platelet count and mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH). The patient underwent two transfusions of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and ADAMTS13 levels confirmed the diagnosis of TTP after discharge. This case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for TTP in the setting of normal laboratory values and reveals the many atypical manifestations of TTP.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a microangiopathy characterized by a mechanical hemolytic anemia and a consumptive thrombocytopenia, resulting in end-organ damage from thrombotic occlusion of small vessels. TTP can either be acquired or congenital. The acquired form is autoimmune, caused by the development of antibodies to ADAMTS13, a proteolytic enzyme which cleaves von Willebrand Factor (vWF). The congenital form is rare and caused by a genetic mutation in the ADAMTS13 gene, leading to a deficiency of the corresponding protein. ADAMTS13 activity levels less than 10% in the presence of an inhibitor are diagnostic of acquired TTP. Microthrombi resulting from conglomerates of uncleaved vWF multimers and platelets can lead to renal failure, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. TTP left untreated has a mortality rate approximating 90%, and therefore patients with suspected TTP are treated with plasma exchange (PLEX) prior to resulting ADAMTS13 levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Hereditary TTP is caused by biallelic ADAMTS13 mutations. It typically presents in infancy but can also manifest in early adulthood. Patients who present with TTP in early adulthood may have a discernible trigger for an initial acute episode such as infection or pregnancy. Relapses are common in both the acquired and congenital forms and may not present in the same manner as the inciting clinical event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. While TTP should be suspected in all patients with otherwise unexplained microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, these laboratory findings may not always precede symptoms and signs of end-organ damage, and in many cases may not be present at all. While few patients present with the classic pentad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurologic deficits, renal failure, and fever, TTP in the setting of a normal to near-normal platelet is a known manifestation of hereditary TTP.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient is a 53-year-old female with a past medical history of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), asplenia, hypertension, hepatitis C, a patent foramen ovale with closure, and multiple strokes presented to our institution with a three-day history of dysequilibrium and nausea.\n\n【7】The patient was initially diagnosed with TTP at age 19 during admission for prolonged uterine bleeding after her first pregnancy. It is unclear how the first diagnosis was made. While splenectomy can be performed for patients with recurrent TTP, this patient underwent splenectomy after her first episode of TTP for unclear reasons. She had a recurrent episode of TTP during her second pregnancy at age 25. More recently, she had an episode of TTP after a cholecystectomy at age 48, with platelets dropping to 16,000/uL, and was treated with total plasma exchange and steroids.\n\n【8】Regarding her history of multiple strokes, she suffered her first stroke to the left middle cerebral artery in 2020 and was started on aspirin and statin. At this time, she was found to have a patent foramen ovale (PFO) on TEE which was thought to be contributing to the stroke; therefore, she underwent surgery for PFO closure. She remained compliant on the medical therapy and yet suffered a repeat stroke to the right corona radiata seven months later. Afterwards, she was switched from aspirin to clopidogrel and remained on a statin for stroke prevention. Despite being on optimal medical therapy, the patient suffered a third stroke to the left cerebellum just one month later. Clopidogrel was then discontinued, and she was started on apixaban 5 mg twice daily. She had been adherent to apixaban when she presented to our institution.\n\n【9】On presentation, the patient was well-appearing and in stable condition. She was found to have an elevated systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg with otherwise stable vital signs. Neurologic examination was significant for subcortical slowing and aphasia from prior strokes and a new left upper extremity ataxia. The patient’s complete blood count was within normal limits (white blood cell count 8.7 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL, hemoglobin of 12 g/dL, and platelets of 216,000/uL). A basic metabolic panel was within normal limits. A head CT without contrast displayed no evidence of an acute intracranial abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed new ischemic changes in the left anterior cerebral artery territory involving the frontoparietal paramedian cortices, confirming the diagnosis of a new stroke.\n\n【10】Hematology was consulted on hospital day 2. The patient was found to have a normal platelet count of 208,000/uL, elevated LDH of 281 unit/L (normal 98–192), and haptoglobin of 159 mg/dL . The patient’s pretest probability of TTP was calculated using the PLASMIC scoring system and was found to place her at a low risk of TTP. However, given her history of TTP, an ADAMTS13 activity level, a peripheral smear, and repeat hemolysis labs were obtained. Peripheral smears revealed several acanthocytes and occasional target cells with <1 schistocytes per high-power field which did not support a diagnosis of TTP. The patient continued on antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy. The patient’s platelets remained within normal range during admission, downtrending to a nadir of 195,000/uL on hospital day 3 . Despite resolution of symptoms and insufficient data to recommend plasma exchange, we recommend transfusion of 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to prevent further recurrence of stroke given the high suspicion of TTP. On hospital day 4, the patient’s platelets rose to 237,000/uL, and she was discharged from the primary neurology service with strict outpatient hematology and neurology follow-up with ADAMTS13 levels pending. The patient was counseled about the likely need for repeat ADAMTS13 replacement via scheduled FFP transfusions. ADAMTS13 activity level resulted after discharge at <3% with the presence of inhibitor at a titer of 1.3 BEU. The patient was eventually able to be seen in the hematology clinic several months later for assessment of prophylactic FFP infusions. ADAMTS13 levels were tested at subsequent visits and had normalized to 22%. The patient was genetically tested for congenital TTP and was found to be negative for any genetic variants.\n\n【11】Table 1 Summary of lab values for patient on admission at the time of evaluation and at discharge.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】While there are more than 200 pathologic genetic variants of the ADAMTS13 mutation, cases of hereditary TTP make up less than 5% of all TTP cases. Many times, these genetic variants can be under-tested, leading to a delay in diagnosis. It is important, then, to use clinical history to aid in the diagnosis of hereditary TTP. Stroke occurs in 25–31% of patients with hereditary TTP, with the median age being just 19 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. While stroke is not an uncommon event in patients suffering from TTP relapse, the majority of these ischemic events occur simultaneously with a drop in platelet number or other indication of hemolytic anemia.\n\n【14】Our patient presented with a recurrent stroke and had normal platelets, mildly elevated LDH, and normal haptoglobin, making this an atypical presentation of TTP. While her history was initially strongly suggestive of hereditary TTP, the presence of an inhibitor points to the fact that this is an atypical presentation of the acquired form. Furthermore, her unremarkable testing for genetic variants confirms this diagnosis. It is likely that the three strokes she suffered prior to this presentation were also manifestations of her acquired TTP. Treatment of hereditary TTP involves prophylactic plasma infusions, which can help prevent future end-organ ischemia. Despite our patient having the acquired form of TTP, her ADAMTS13 levels still responded to the prophylactic infusions of plasma.\n\n【15】Because of the high mortality associated with untreated TTP, particular attention should be paid to young or middle-aged individuals who present with recurrent strokes in the absence of obvious cardiovascular risk factors, even in the setting of normal platelet counts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The development of thrombosis may precede the development of laboratory abnormalities in patients with either congenital or acquired TTP. There are rare reports of atypical TTP presenting initially as either pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction prior to the development of marked thrombocytopenia or hemolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, and therefore a high index of suspicion must be maintained even in the absence of a high pretest probability, as in our patient. Demonstrating decreased ADAMTS13 activity is a highly specific way to confirm the diagnosis of TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, and it can play a role in timely therapy with either total plasma exchange or administration of FFP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Furthermore, caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor immunoglobulin fragment, has been shown to normalize platelet counts and prevent recurrence of TTP when used during and 30 days after administration of plasma exchange therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The current data suggest that caplacizumab is most efficacious when used at the time of diagnosis, and there is a paucity of data regarding its use as solely a prophylactic medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. It also appears that the effects of caplacizumab after discontinuation may not be long-lasting, as recurrence rates for TTP were shown to be higher during the patient follow-up period after drug cessation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In addition, its high cost burden makes it even more difficult to justify its use in our patient, for whom a clinically significant benefit may not be realizable. At follow-up, the patient’s ADAMTS13 levels had normalized without any further administration of plasma or immunosuppressant therapy. Because of this, the patient was managed with a watchful waiting approach and has ADAMTS13 levels checked routinely at 3-4 month intervals to guide further treatment approaches.\n\n【16】Our patient’s case reveals the variation in presentation of TTP, the complexity of diagnosis, and demonstrates a lack of evidence that can be used to guide management in patients with recurrent episodes of TTP but normal markers of hemolysis. Further studies need to be performed in order to delineate whether prophylactic plasma transfusions, immunosuppression, or caplacizumab can be useful for recurrent episodes of autoimmune acquired TTP and how frequently these patients should be monitored.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The immunohistochemical results showed that CD4 positive cells and some other cells were gathered among the necrotic muscle fibers. We conclude that immunological abnormalities are present in the specimens of certain childhood-onset NM patients without autoimmune diseases. Further evaluation of the immunological changes is warranted in childhood-onset NM patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

However, little is known about the immunological changes in the specimens from childhood-onset NM patients without autoimmune diseases. Here, we described the clinical and pathological features of four cases of childhood-onset NM patients without autoimmune diseases and examined whether immunological abnormalities can be found in their specimens.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【5】Four patients, one female and three males, with an age range of 6–12 years old (mean age 9 years old) were admitted to our hospital. The clinical manifestations were as follows: three of them with progressive hypotonia of both lower extremities, whereas another case with progressive hypotonia of limbs. The respiratory function of the four patients is normal. Physical examination revealed that the vital signs, development, consciousness, and intelligence, are normal. There is no atrophy of both sternocleidomastoid muscles. The following lab tests are normal: erythrocyte sedimentation, blood lipid, hepatic function, antistreptolysin O, C reaction protein, antinuclear antibody, immunoglobulin, antibody of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and syphilis. Abdominal ultrasound, ECG, color Doppler ultrasound, and cardiac output showed negative results. The creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level in one of the four patients was higher than that in normal controls. Myogenic damage of affected muscle was examined by electromyography. The four patients did not have family medical history or other immune diseases. Results from clinical, laboratory, and ancillary investigations of the four patients are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【6】Table 1 Results from clinical, laboratory, and ancillary investigations of the four patients (the normal value of CPK should be less than 183 U/L).\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Pathological Findings\n\n【8】All muscle biopsies had been received in a fresh state from vastus lateralis of left quadriceps and were divided into two portions. One portion was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen cooling isopentane, and 8 μm frozen sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E), modified Gomori trichrome (MGT), periodic acid Schiff (PAS), oil red O, ATPase at pH 9.6, 4.6, and 4.3, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) alone as well as combined with cytochrome oxidase (Cox with SDH), myophosphorylase, amylopectinase phosphofructokinase, adenylate deaminase. HE, MGT, and ATPase stains are essential for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of muscle diseases; PAS, oil red O, NADH-TR, SDH, COX, myophosphorylase, amylopectinase phosphofructokinase, and adenylate deaminase staining were used to exclude glycogen storage diseases, mitochondrial myopathy, lipid storage myopathy, and so on. In addition, CD4 and CD8 immunostaining was used to examine immunological abnormalities in the specimens. Another part of specimens was fixed in the 2% glutaraldehyde and embedded with Epon812, 1 μm semithin slices were then cut for toluidine blue stain and made into thin slices for lead-uranium double stain, and myopathic features were detected on electromyography (Hitachi H2800).\n\n【9】HE staining revealed inequality of size of muscle fibers and a lot of atrophic muscle fibers and compensatory hypertrophic muscle fibers in all cases. In addition, some dark red uniform of eosinophilic matters was also observed between some of the muscle fibers 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Dark blue rod-like structures or nemaline rods were observed under light microscopy with MGT stain, whereas abnormal red fibers were not found 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. Histochemistry of ATP enzyme staining demonstrated Type I fiber predominance in all cases of NM 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. However, we did not find any evidence of positive results when stained with oil red O or PAS. Necrotic muscle fibers were found in two specimens, and the immunohistochemical results of these two specimens showed that some CD4 positive cells and other cells were gathered among the muscle fibers 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(e))</u>, but CD8 positive cells were not found 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(f))</u>. Electron microscopic examination revealed characteristic rod-like structures were observed predominantly in the subsarcolemmal location but not within the myofibers, and their morphology varied from single rod to large aggregates.

Although previous reports revealed that some of these patients present with dilated cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, the associated cardiac involvement was not found in these four patients. MGT staining and electron microscopic examination demonstrated that the nemaline body existed within the normal size muscle fibers and atrophic muscle fibers. Muscle fibers with nemaline body account more than 60 percent of the total fibers, and the proportion in each muscle bundle varied, which is similar to what is described in a previous report; the proportion of muscle fibers with nemaline body correlated with the time course of disease progress but did not correlate with the age of onset and the severity of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The cause of NM is not clear. Previous studies revealed that childhood onset nemaline myopathy may be a genetic condition with at least six different causative genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Other research found that about half of the late onset NM patients complicated with immune system diseases, such as HIV, human T-cell lymphocytes infected with the virus, monoclonal gammopathy, and primary hypothyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. However, the association between childhood onset NM and immunological abnormalities was rarely reported. In this paper, we found that necrotic muscle fibers were found in two specimens of the four cases. In addition, immunohistochemical results revealed that some CD4 positive cells and other cells were gathered among the muscle fibers. We concluded that inflammatory cell infiltration may be associated with the necrosis of some fibers, and immunological abnormalities were found in some childhood-onset NM patients without autoimmune diseases. Although we agree that childhood onset NM is a genetic muscular disorder, the immunological abnormalities may be also a characteristic feature in some cases. To clarify its association with abnormal gene expression, and which gene may play a role in this pathologic process, further study is warranted.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

An axial abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan for suspected phlebitis and cellulitis revealed that the catheter was located in the right inferior epigastric vein.

The aim of the present study was to report the physiological stimulation of the synthesis of preelastic fibers in the dermis of a patient with fibrosis. Design. A clinical study was conducted involving the analysis of histological changes in preelastic fibers following treatment for stage II primary lymphedema for the clinical reversal of lymphedema and fibrosis. Setting. University Hospital of the São Jose do Rio Preto of School of Medicine in 2020. Participant was a 67-year-old male patient with late-onset primary lymphedema diagnosed 12 years earlier. Intervention is the lymphatic stimulation using the Godoy method adapted to the treatment of fibrosis. Main outcomes and measures are biopsies before and after treatment. Ten randomly selected histological fields were evaluated using the multipoint morphometric method. The values with this method are relative and expressed as percentages. Statistical analysis was performed with the t\\-test, considering a 95% significance level. Results. A visible, significant difference in the percentage of preelastic fibers was found between the preintervention and postintervention slides, which were confirmed by the microscopic evaluation and quantification (4.95 ± 0.64% and 14.70 ± 1.06%, respectively). Conclusion. The physiological stimulation of the lymphatic system using a specific method resulted in the clinical reduction of fibrosis, the return of the elasticity of the skin, and the stimulation of the synthesis of preelastic fibers.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Fibrosis results from conditions that lead to the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), compromising tissue function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The main characteristic of fibrosis is the excessive secretion of connective tissue fibers, which is associated with a myriad of diseases that lead to organ failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The critical event in the development of fibrosis is the aberrant, sustained activation of fibroblasts in myofibroblasts, which produce high levels of ECM, leading to the formation of a dense fibrous tissue in the affected area and increasing local rigidity of the tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Diseases with fibrosis place a substantial burden on the healthcare system and economy and are often fatal. Although fibrosis is traditionally considered an irreversible process, there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that the fibrosis of organs can be reversed under certain circumstances, especially if the underlying cause is removed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Elastic fibers are essential components of all elastic tissues in mammals, such as blood vessels, lungs, and skin, and are extremely important due to the mechanical properties these fibers confer to tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The network of dermal fibers is the main effector of elasticity in the skin, enabling it to stretch and return to its original position many times throughout life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Fibrillin-rich microfibrils (FRMs) are integral components of the elastic fiber network, with differential deposition in the papillary dermis in individuals of different skin colors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【6】It is important to note that the resolution of fibrosis requires the degradation of other ECM components, such as proteoglycans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, elastic fibers, and collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Novel concepts in the treatment of lymphedema have been adapted to the treatment of fibrosis. Such concepts propose the normalization or near normalization of lymphedema in all clinical stages, including elephantiasis, with the clinical reversal of fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–15\\]</u>. The aim of the present study was to report the physiological stimulation of the synthesis of preelastic fibers in the dermis of a patient with fibrosis.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【8】A 67-year-old male patient with late-onset primary lymphedema diagnosed 12 years earlier and one episode of erysipelas in this period was submitted to physical examination, which revealed fibrosis of the dermis characterized by the absence of Godet’s sign. The patient was otherwise healthy, not obese, had no comorbidities, and continued working normally. The Godoy method for the treatment of lymphedema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–15\\]</u> adapted to fibrosis was proposed to achieve the normalization of the dermis (return of elasticity). The intensive treatment method consists of cervical lymphatic therapy using the Godoy method (approximately 30 gentle movements on the skin in the supraclavicular region 15–20 minutes per day) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, combined with 8 hours of mechanical lymphatic therapy involving an electromechanical device that performs approximately 25 passive plantar flexion and extension movements per minute 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, 2 hours per day of manual lymphatic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, and a compression mechanism (hand-crafted stocking made with grosgrain fabric 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> alternated with medium-stretch elastic bandages maintained throughout the entire treatment). These therapies were performed simultaneously totaling about 8 hours/day. The duration of treatment was 2 months, when the clinical reversal of fibrosis was achieved, and the elasticity of the skin had improved. The clinical evaluation of the skin was constant throughout the treatment, and at the time, it had its elasticity clinically evaluated by manual skin pinching. At that time, there was no difference in this elasticity in relation to the normal contralateral limb. At this point, the postintervention biopsy was performed. Biopsies were performed before and after the intervention in the same region at a distance of 1 cm of other in parallel. For such, basic surgical care was taken, such as asepsis and antisepsis, local anesthesia using 2 ml de xylocaine 2%, followed by a longitudinal wedge-shaped incision approximately 1 cm in length and 0.5 cm in width. The biopsied material was maintained in 10% formol and embedded in paraffin. The slides were stained with orcein and resorcin-fuchsin evaluated under an optical microscope. The magnifications were 10X and 40X. Ten randomly selected histological fields were evaluated using the multipoint morphometric method proposed by Weibel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The values with this method are relative and expressed as percentages. The data were submitted to a normality test and expressed as mean and standard deviation values.

The patient signed a statement of informed consent.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】This is the first study in the international literature to show the possibility of the physiological stimulation of the synthesis of preelastic fibers and remodeling of these fibers during the clinical treatment of primary lymphedema with fibrosis. In a previous evaluation (in publication phase), an important rearrangement of elastin was found, with an approximately 250% increase in the number of fibers. In the present investigation, a more specific evaluation was performed of preelastic fibers in the dermis, in which a significant increase of 336% was found after treatment, with an increase in the number of fibers in the superficial dermis as well as an increase in the number and thickness of fibers in the deep dermis.\n\n【16】The treatment method influenced the physiological remodeling of this protein, which could be attributed to the synthesis of new elastic fibers. These fibers account for only 2–4% of the ECM but play an important role in the elasticity of the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The present study paves the way for a new line of research involving the physiological stimulation of the production and remodeling of elastin.\n\n【17】The treatment method employed is a novel concept for the treatment of lymphedema adapted to fibrosis, which has specific characteristics. The method is proposed to achieve the clinical reversal of lymphedema, including elephantiasis, to standards of normality or near normality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The main hypothesis for the development of fibrosis in lymphedema is the lack of the mobilization of macromolecules by the lymphatic system combined with other mechanisms, such as inflammation, interference in the production of the elements of the ECM, and the failure of fibrinolysis. All these mechanisms are currently being evaluated specifically to gain a better understanding of these cellular and ECM dynamics.\n\n【19】Elastin and collagen are the main constituents of the fibers of the ECM and are therefore of fundamental importance in the development of fibrosis. Further studies are needed to identify each of the structures and mechanisms that may be involved in the dynamics of the formation of fibrosis, which has different stages and each stage may have distinct characteristics.

We present a patient who had been taking diindolylmethane and developed right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary embolism. Case Presentation. A 65-year-old man presented with swelling, erythema, and warmth of his right lower extremity for three to four weeks. He had been taking diindolylmethane one tablet daily for three to four months. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism included tobacco use, personal history of possible pulmonary embolism, body mass index, and age. Imaging studies found extensive deep venous thrombosis in his right lower extremity and bilateral pulmonary embolism with probable right middle lobe infarction. Follow-up imaging showed chronic deep venous thrombosis in his right lower extremity. Discussion. As suggested in this single case, patients who take diindolylmethane may be at greater risk for venous thromboembolism. Further reports and studies are necessary in order to elucidate this possible association. Clinicians should question patients about supplements in the setting of venous thromboembolism.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Within 10 years of an initial VTE, 17.6% of patients have been found to develop recurrent VTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Risk factors for VTE include older age, above-normal body mass index, personal or family history of VTE, surgery, hospitalization, malignancy, myeloproliferative disease, trauma, immobility, varicose veins, pregnancy or puerperium, postmenopausal hormone therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, oral contraceptives (OCPs), extended travel, genetic factors, antiphospholipid syndrome, and tobacco use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–7\\]</u>.

The effect, if any, of DIM on the formation of VTE is unknown. We describe the first reported case of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in a man with risk factors for VTE taking DIM.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 65-year-old man with a remote history of possible PE and current tobacco use presented with swelling, erythema, and warmth of his right lower extremity for three to four weeks . He denied cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, chest pain, recent travel, prolonged immobilization, or history of malignancy. Approximately ten years ago he was diagnosed with a PE at an unrecallable hospital and did not receive anticoagulation. The events surrounding this self-reported PE could not be verified.\n\n【6】Table 1 Timeline of events.\n\n【7】Five weeks before presentation, the patient went to the Emergency Department with low back and right buttock pain radiating down to the mid-posterior right calf and was diagnosed with sciatica. Two weeks later, he returned with pleuritic chest pain and exertional dyspnea, thought to be secondary to costochondritis; he left against medical advice. Three weeks later, on the day of admission, he was evaluated by his primary care physician, who obtained a lower extremity venous Doppler study that showed extensive DVT in his right lower extremity 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) The lower extremity venous Doppler study on the day of admission showed acute deep venous thrombosis in the right common femoral, femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins.

He had used over-the-counter testosterone supplements for six months but discontinued them 13 months before hospitalization. Prior to his hospitalization, he used DIM one tablet daily for three to four months. He did not know the dose, but a common dose is 100 mg per tablet. He had a 60 pack-year smoking history, with cessation for five years prior to resumption one year ago. He had a documented weight loss of 7 kg over one month, but he endorsed a recent increase in exercise, including skiing and weight lifting. Colonoscopy four months earlier found a benign polyp. Prostate specific antigen was less than 3 ng/mL a year before and during hospitalization.\n\n【10】Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure 123/81 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 36.1°C, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. The right leg was mildly swollen with erythema and warmth. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Chemistry panel, complete blood count, hepatic function panel, and coagulation studies were normal. PE-protocol computed tomography (CT) of the chest  showed bilateral pulmonary artery filling defects with marked involvement of the right middle lobe branch with associated probable infarction. He was treated with anticoagulation and counseled on tobacco dependence. Five months later, a lower extremity venous Doppler study found chronic DVT in the right lower extremity 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Computed tomography of the chest depicting filling defects in the pulmonary arterial vasculature secondary to pulmonary embolism.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Computed tomography of the chest depicting filling defects in the pulmonary arterial vasculature secondary to pulmonary embolism and probable right middle lobe infarction.</u>\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】We describe a patient who developed acute right lower extremity DVT and bilateral PE with right middle lobe infarction and subsequent chronic right lower extremity DVT. Although the time course is unclear, while taking DIM, he may have started developing the DVT five weeks before admission when he presented with right lower extremity complaints and the PE three weeks before admission when he presented with thoracic and respiratory complaints. His risk factors for VTE included older age, an above-normal body mass index, tobacco use, a past history of possible PE, and the unclear estrogenic effects of DIM. With a documented weight loss of 7 kg over one month, he may have had an undiscovered cancer, despite negative age-appropriate cancer screening and no evidence of malignancy on CT angiography. Although causality cannot be demonstrated in this single case, the use of DIM preceded the VTE by several months, and DIM may have contributed to the development of VTE.\n\n【15】DIM is not specifically an estrogen analogue but does bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which interacts with the estrogen-related pathways, and the estrogen receptor. DIM has both agonist and antagonist properties in estrogen physiology, in addition to having testosterone antagonist properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–12, 14–17\\]</u>. Estrogen analogues modify the milieu of the coagulation factors, anticoagulation system, and fibrinolytic system in a way that promotes VTE, particularly in patients with genetic predispositions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Vandenbroucke et al. found the incidence of venous thrombosis to be 0.8 per 10,000 person-years and 3.0 per 10,000 person-years for non-OCP users and OCP users, respectively, and the relative risk of venous thrombosis to be 3.8 (95% CI 2.4–6.0) for OCP users and even higher for patients with the factor V Leiden mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Given the interaction of DIM in the estrogen- and testosterone-related pathways, the limited studies of DIM have focused on breast, cervical, and prostate cancer research. Malignancies are a risk factor for thromboembolism, and any additional risk that DIM confers is unclear. Further research into the beneficial and adverse effects of DIM is necessary. Such research may involve the dose-dependent effect of DIM. DIM is ingested naturally in the diet, but supraphysiological dosing may promote the development of VTE.\n\n【17】This single case of a patient developing acute DVT and PE while taking DIM with a long-term complication of chronic DVT reiterates the importance of obtaining information about supplements. In the appropriate clinical context, such as the presence of risks for VTE, clinicians need to have a low threshold for further evaluation for VTE. Other cases of VTE in the setting of DIM should be reported.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "e01fc2f9-c625-4ddf-894e-7d987f3f8fd2", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】We report a new case of p63/cytokeratin 7 (CK7) positive syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum (SCACP), on the shoulder of an 88-year-old man, with superficial dermal infiltration and squamoid differentiation. We describe the 24th case of SCACP, the malignant counterpart of syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SCAP). At the present, we do not know whether SCACP arises from eccrine or apocrine glands because of the contrasting opinions in the literature. Only few histochemical and ultrastructural studies have previously advised that SCACP could arise from pluripotent stem cells. Through our case, we wish to suggest the stem cell-like properties of the syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum. This rare neoplasm shows two different patterns of stem cell marker expression in the glandular and squamous components, respectively. For the double phenotype of SCACP, we propose it like an intriguing model to study histogenesis and stem cell properties for more wide-ranging epithelial tumors.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum (SCACP) is a rare malignant form of syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SCAP), cutaneous adnexal neoplasm defined by Stokes in 1917. Some authors are unsure about the malignant transformation in syringocystadenoma papilliferum but, recently, Hoekzema et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> have presented a well-documented SCACP case arising from preexisting SCAP, which appeared to be an epidermal nevus. SCAP mostly occurs in the head and neck region and is associated with a nevus sebaceous (NS) of Jadassohn in 30–40% of cases, but may also appear de novo (without NS) on other parts of the body.\n\n【4】There is an increasing evidence for an apocrine histogenesis of SCAP and SCACP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> but the possibility of an eccrine origin from sweat glands for a few cases seems likely. Another theory suggests the apoeccrine glands to be the origin of these tumors that could be skin hamartomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. Very few histochemical and ultrastructural studies propose that SCACP arises from pluripotent cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 4\\]</u>. A little map of the different theories is shown in Table 1.\n\n【5】Table 1 Histogenetic theories of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.\n\n【6】Histologically, the connection to the skin surface, by typical epidermal transition, the decapitation on the luminal surface of inner layer cells, the tumor connection to folliculosebaceous structures, the layering of apocrine glands in the underlying tissues, and positive reactions to diastase-resistance periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) provide evidence of apocrine differentiation of SCACP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Herein, we report a case of SCACP occurring on the left shoulder of an 88-year-old European male patient.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【9】##### 2.1. Case\n\n【10】An 88-year-old man presented with a single nodule on the left shoulder. He had had multiple lesions for 20 years of bowenoid actinic keratosis on the face, the forehead, and the left ear. In the last 13 years, the patient underwent prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma, score 8 (5+3) according to Gleason and squamous cell carcinoma on the left eyelid surgically treated. The man stated that the lesion began as a bean-sized papule and had increased gradually in size with time. It also became painful. Physical examination revealed a single, 1.5 × 1.5 cm, erythematous, dome-shaped, and firm tumor surrounded by normal skin on the left shoulder. Regional lymph nodes were not palpable, and the physical examination did not reveal any remarkable findings except for the mass. The patient had no clinical or radiographic evidence of a head and neck or lung primary tumors. He died after two years of old age.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Histology\n\n【12】The present skin tumor was clinically analyzed and then resected tumor specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 μm were subjected to conventional microscopic histochemical and immunohistochemical observations.\n\n【13】PAS reaction, with and without diastase digestion, was also carried out.\n\n【14】For the immunostaining, we used an automatic and clinically validated instrument based on Ventana Benchmark Ultra systems from Roche Tissue Diagnostics. Immunohistochemistry was performed by means of a new enhanced sensitivity biotin-free multimer technology system, based on direct linkers between peroxidase and secondary antibodies (ultraView Universal DAB Detection Kit, Ventana Medical System). The following primary antibodies were used prediluted: antipancytokeratin (PCT), anticytokeratin 7 (CK7), anticytokeratin 5/6 (MES), anti-e-cadherin (epithelial) (e-cad), antiepithelial membrane antigen (EMA), anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), anti-p63, anti-S100 by Ventana; anti-CD117 (c-kit) (Cell Marque), and anti-Ki-67 antigen (MIB-1) by DAKO.\n\n【15】For immunofluorescence, sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, as described above, and unmasked using a commercially available kit (Unmasker, Diapath). Slices were incubated with Immunological Sciences primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-CD44 1 : 50, and rabbit polyclonal anti-CD133 4 μL/mL and then incubated with Molecular Probes secondary antibodies, 1 : 100, goat anti-mouse, green fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated and goat anti-rabbit, and red fluorescent Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated and finally counterstained with 0.0001% DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), in accordance with the preview published protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【17】All the immunoprofiling data about the normal skin, the benign lesion, and the carcinomatous component are summarized in Table 2.\n\n【18】Table 2 Antigen expression of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.\n\n【19】Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histological sections showed squamous cancer cells in the dermis to be gradually deepening. The squamous budding generated internal cavities giving rise to glandular papillary structures. These tumoral squamous-papillary glands were positively stained by anti-PCT antibody in the outer layer of budding; the glandular component was heterogeneously stained with accentuation of the membranes. Anti-CK5/6 strongly stained the transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplasia; the squamous solid component and the glandular structures were moderately stained. The transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplasia was strongly positive for CK7; the glandular budding and the papillary components were intensely stained by CK7 antibody; contemporaneously, the squamous solid neoplasia appeared negative. E-cad staining showed an increase of pericytoplasmic positivity in the transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplasia but completely negative was the infiltrative portion. Neoplastic areas, in contrast with normal epidermis, resulted in totally stained EMA. Syringocystadenocarcinoma was completely negative for CEA and robustly positive with patchy nuclear for p63 staining. By anti-c-kit antibody, we obtained highly positive staining of basal layer of neoplastic budding; the glandular and papillary structures were heterogeneously positive but almost negative and/or speckled positive was the squamous solid component. The evident desmoplastic stromal reaction accompanied the budding and contained numerous plasma cells and lymphocytes. The epithelial transition and the decapitated secretion provided evidence of apocrine differentiation; the cytological atypia gave a precious suggestion of the neoplasm. An invasive squamous component coexisted with glandular elements typical for adenocarcinomas. The dual p63-CK7 immunohistochemical positivity was useful in confirming the diagnosis definitive of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.\n\n【20】Nestin, CD44, and CD133 antigens, markers of stem cell properties, were overexpressed in the neoplasm and could suggest a tumor origin by pluripotent stem cells.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【22】We report a second case of syringocystadenocarcinoma with some unique histologic features; preview described by Leeborg et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> demonstrates the p63 positive-gradual transition area from keratinizing squamous epithelium to neoplasm 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>. Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is a rare neoplasm of doubtful (apocrine versus eccrine) origin and is the malignant counterpart of the more common benign syringocystadenoma papilliferum. Histologically, syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum resembles syringocystadenoma papilliferum and solid areas of tumor may be present, in addition to the glandular, cystic, and papillary areas that deepen like dermal cleft by a squamous transition epithelium 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u>. The glandular epithelial cells show malignant cytological features, such as high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios and nuclear irregularity, and, in particular, they are PAS diastase positive, with decapitated cytoplasm, confirming the apocrine origin. Our case is distinctive in several aspects. It is the second report, to our knowledge, to document the presence of a high-grade cell component originally considered to be a high-grade squamous cell carcinoma and then demonstrated adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is the first case to provide immunohistochemical evidence of stem cell features and epithelial-mesenchymal transition- (EMT-) like properties.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Analysis of a skin syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum specimen.

(d) A few positive cells of the squamous neoplasia are stained by Nestin antibody, stemness marker (original magnification ×400). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【25】To analyze the biological and carcinogenetic property of our tumor case, we have used a series of antibodies fit for recognizing epithelial expression, proliferation index, and stem cell properties.\n\n【26】Like Leeborg et al. suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, we have found CK7 and p63 positive-cells in continuous stream from normal epithelium to neoplastic adenocarcinoma clefts, that is, the squamous-glandular transdifferentiation of the tumor 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(c), 1(d), 2(a), and 2(b))</u>. Furthermore p63 positivity supports the primary origin of the squamous and/or cutaneous-adnexal tumor and distinguishes it from metastatic adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Simultaneously, we have demonstrated, for the first time, a possible staminal origin of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum by c-kit, nestin, CD44, and CD133 immunopositivity.\n\n【27】The transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit (CD117) is a 145–165-kD proto-oncogene, related to platelet-derived factor receptor and the colony stimulatory factor receptor. The primary ligand for c-kit is stem cell factor (SCF) or also named mast cell growth factor and steel factor. Evidence supports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> the existence of CD117 as putative marker of mesenchymal stem cells and/or cancer stem cells. Overexpression of c-kit has been demonstrated in several human tumors such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), small-cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, Ewing’s tumor, and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Other c-kit positive-normal cells include epithelial cells in skin adnexa, breast, and subsets of cerebellar neurons.\n\n【28】In our case, we observed c-kit positive-epidermal epithelium basal layer connected with neoplastic budding by c-kit positive-tumor cells that presented the same pattern of positivity for CK7 and p63, too 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(c), 1(c), and 2(a))</u>. The positivity for c-kit was robust and more intense in the basal layer of the glandular neoplastic budding, in continuity with the c-kit positive-normal basal layer of epithelium. We observed heterogeneously intense-moderate amount of staining of glandular and papillary structures; almost negative, with limited occurrence and speckled positivity appeared the squamous solid component. Interestingly, we found some positive spindle cells in perineoplastic stroma . Recently, it has been reported that c-kit plays a critical role in the invasion and metastasis of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) and may participate in EMT of salivary ACC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Furthermore e-cad staining was interestingly expressed (data not shown). We found, as recent literature has proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>, a different level of this central component of cell junctions-adhesion molecule: plasmalemmal positivity in the normal tissue and in the transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplastic budding with occasionally negative neoplastic cells; we observed a gradual decreasing of e-cad positivity into neoplasia, with focally negative neoplastic glands. Totally unstained appeared the invasive papillary component. All of these data together either with c-kit pattern or with the spindle cell morphology in the front of infiltration and the surrounding desmoplastic stromal reaction 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(c), S1, and 1(b))</u> could be convincing features of EMT-like process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>. The EMT paradigm is a developmental pathway by which epithelial cells are transdifferentiated to mesenchymal cells during embryogenesis, tissue remodelling, and wound healing. Recently, an interesting hypothesis considers EMT as a more general event that has been implicated in all types of carcinoma and provides them with an additional survival advantage. By means of EMT, the epithelial tumor cells would transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, losing their malignant phenotype but producing the desmoplastic stroma which is essential for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. In human cancer, the phenomenon is rarely demonstrated because, after the infiltrative spreading, it is fast reverted by mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) program, in cancerous epithelial phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27–29\\]</u>. It has been observed that, during the EMT process, cancer epithelial cells acquire stem cell-like traits and appear positive for putative cancer stem cell (CSC) markers, resulting in a migratory cell phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30, 31\\]</u>. So EMT-like properties of carcinoma are more persuasive, when they are associated with an increase of putative stemness marker expression. For this reason, we have analyzed nestin, CD44, and CD133 antigens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 24, 32–34\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Nestin, VI intermediate filament protein and marker of precursor cells, is also expressed in the stem cells of the hair follicle and in the endothelial cells; moreover, nestin is expressed in the peritumoral stroma of basal cell carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 33\\]</u>. In our case, we found in bulge squamous area of neoplasia some nests of nestin-positive stroma cells with mesenchymal phenotype  but also convincing clusters of nestin positive-cancer stem cells in the epithelial neoplasia 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u>.\n\n【30】The CD44 antigen is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion and migration, for these properties participate in a wide variety of cellular functions including lymphocyte activation, recirculation and homing, hematopoiesis, and tumor metastasis. Recently CD44 has been recognized as a marker of putative cancer stem cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>, in particular of squamous phenotype; CD44 high expression plays a crucial key role in initiation, malignant transformation, and EMT-like program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 32, 36\\]</u>. An interesting aspect of our case consists of evident overexpression of CD44 in squamous component of neoplasia, with spreading positivity in the perineoplastic stroma cells. Almost completely negative for CD44 appeared the glandular and papillary components .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the staminal property of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.

However, this protein has been identified as a potential cancer stem cell marker in the brain, colon, prostate, pancreas, and, recently, the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Until now, the correlation between CD133 expression and clinicopathological features of tumors, like increased tumorigenic and patient survival, persist undemonstrated. Only few data in the literature describe the clinical significance of the expression patterns of CD133 (membranous and/or cytoplasmic) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u> but it is clear that aberrant overexpression is pathognomonic for neoplasia. In particular, we found as a strong uniform pattern of nuclear-cytoplasmic CD133 overexpression in the adenocomponent that had lost the CD44 membranous positivity during the glandular neoplastic transdifferentiation .\n\n【33】By PCT immunostaining, we demonstrated the epithelial origin of the tumor because PCT immunopositive-cells appeared in normal epithelium and in continuity with the external layer of the neoplasm. This suggests the primary epithelial budding of adenocarcinoma. (data not shown). CD133, prominin, increased in squamous carcinoma but more prominently in cystic-glandular neoplasia. This pattern, associated with specular behavior of CD44, can suggest the development and evolution of glandular part from squamous component.\n\n【34】By intense immunopositivity for CK7, p63, and c-kit and the particular neoplastic stromal reactivity, we hypothesized that this tumor could have EMT-like properties. Furthermore, the p63/CK7 staining has also highlighted the squamous transdifferentiation of this adnexal-like neoplasm. Since the normal basal layer of epithelium was c-kit positive like the neoplastic component, we suggest that this tumor could derive from pluripotent-like cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>, also with the support of high positivity for nestin, CD133, and CD44. Typical PCT immunostaining demonstrated the ontogenetic behavior of epithelial-adnexal neoplastic budding. In front of these original data, we suggest to reanalyze the syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum cases in the light of new evidences regarding histogenesis and stem cell-like properties. Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is a very infrequent skin tumor but could be a good model to verify the existence of the cancer stem cells and their transdifferentiable properties in skin neoplasms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Afterwards, the patient developed mild, diffuse, constant abdominal pain with nausea that worsened on the day of presentation, prompting his ED visit.\n\n【6】In the ED, the patient had a temperature of 102.3°F, leukocytosis with left shift, and a positive urinalysis. In addition, the patient was noted to have hyperbilirubinemia to 4.5 with elevated liver enzymes (ALT 413, AST 340, and ALP 203).\n\n【7】A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast demonstrated dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts with the common bile duct measuring up to 12 mm. There were multiple hyperdensities within the bile ducts particularly at the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts in addition to the distal CBD, consistent with choledocholithiasis .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Axial CT of the abdomen with contrast at the level of the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts demonstrates an 11 mm hyperdensity likely representing a calculus (arrow).

The patient was asked to follow-up with his gastroenterologist as an outpatient.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of bile duct stones. It is estimated that up to 15% of patients <60 years of age have stones in the common bile duct, whereas it can be as high as 60% in the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Risk factors identified for complicated choledocholithiasis are Asian descent, increasing age, and male gender 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. It is estimated that between 3.4 and 10% of patients have choledocholithiasis at the time of cholecystectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Delayed choledocholithiasis has been reported in patients with the most common etiologies being retained or regeneration of stones within a gallbladder remnant or cystic duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Studies have shown that the vast majority of patients (80%) with choledocholithiasis following cholecystectomy will present within 3 years of surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 9\\]</u>. Presentation later than this is thought to be secondary to migrating surgical clips with cases being reported up to twenty years following cholecystectomy. Only a few reports have identified disease at a later interval 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Rarely were the stones deemed to be primary as in our case.\n\n【17】Intrahepatic lithiasis can be either primary or secondary. Primary intrahepatic lithiasis is less common in the US and is usually the result of single or multiple cystic dilatations of the intrahepatic biliary tree resulting bile stasis. Secondary intrahepatic stones are the result of migration of gallbladder or CBD stones or strictures related to previous surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Other risk factors include prior sphincterotomy, which could allow for debris to enter the CBD leading to infection and nidus formation and metabolic disorders.\n\n【18】Saharia et al. described a group of 30 patients with primary biliary stones following cholecystectomy with an average of 12 years following surgery until diagnosis. The most frequent presenting symptom was acute cholangitis as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This was one of the few articles that were found after extensive research describing primary choledocholithiasis following cholecystectomy.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】We present a rare case of primary choledocholithiasis postcholecystectomy, which, to our knowledge, is one of only a few in literature studies. Given the latency of presentation, it is important to have choledocholithiasis in mind even a number of years after cholecystectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Vascular reasons, herniation, volvulus, acute gastric dilatation, anorexia, and bulimia nervosa play a role in the etiology of the disease. Early diagnosis and treatment are highly important as the associated morbidity and mortality rates are high. In this case report, we present a case of gastric necrosis due to acute gastric dilatation accompanied with the relevant literature.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The pathogenesis of acute gastric dilatation (AGD) is not fully known, and several theories currently exist. Vascular compression, herniation, volvulus, acute necrotizing gastritis, complications after abdominal surgery, anorexia, bulimia nervosa, trauma, exposure to caustic materials, diabetes, and acute massive gastric dilatation are indicated in the etiology of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Gastric ischemia and necrosis are rare due to the rich collateral blood flow to the stomach. However, if a sudden increase in gastric pressure occurs, gastric ischemia and necrosis can develop due to the impairment of the intramural blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】In this case report, we present a case of gastric necrosis due to acute gastric dilatation in terms of the literature.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 26-year-old hemiplegic, mentally and motor-retarded female patient was admitted to the ER with sudden-onset abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, and vomiting. The patient had a temperature of 38.5°C, blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg, heart rate of 112/min, and respiratory rate of 32/min. Physical examination revealed abdominal distention, defense, rebound, and tenderness. Her laboratory tests were normal except for elevated white blood cell count (25.000/mm³). Direct abdominal X-ray images obtained in a standing position showed air almost completely filling the left upper quadrant of the fundus and extending into the right upper quadrant . Immediately after the NG tube was inserted, 2000 cc of gastric dilatation fluid (coffeeground colored fluid) was discharged. The patient was prepared for urgent surgery. The patient’s stomach was highly dilated during exploration . Diffuse necrotic zones in the gastric fundus and greater curvature of the corpus were detected . About 3000 cc of fluid was aspirated from the stomach during surgery. Total gastrectomy and esophagojejunostomy were performed on the patient, and she was discharged ten days after the operation.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Direct abdominal X-ray image, obtained in a standing position, showing air almost completely filling the left upper quadrant of the fundus and extending into the right upper quadrant. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Diffuse gastric dilatation. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Diffuse necrotic zones in the gastric fundus and greater curvature of the corpus. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Gastric necrosis due to rich blood flow to the stomach is relatively rare. Acute gastric dilatation was first described by Todd et al. in 2000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Casper et al. identified AGD in only four cases in their study of 23,000 postmortem cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The causes of gastric infarct include intrathoracic herniation, volvulus, acute necrotizing gastritis, drinking corrosive substances, vascular compression, and AGD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5\\]</u>. AGD has also been found to occur in patients with anorexia nervosa, bulimia, low body mass index, or nutritional deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Additionally, in 1859, Brinton suggested the atonic theory: that gastric atonia and muscular atrophy occur in patients with eating disorders during hunger; then, sudden and excessive eating causes the weakened stomach to overload 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Since no undigested food was present in the stomach, only excessive gastric dilatation, we hypothesized that gastric necrosis played a role in the etiology of AGD in the present case.\n\n【13】Evaluation of psychiatric patients with abdominal pain is difficult. A detailed anamnesis cannot be obtained, and thus, the surgeon must act based on physical examination findings and must be informed of and experienced with surgical diseases seen in psychiatric patients. Physical examination findings can widely differ amongst patients. Diagnosis can be supported by radiological imaging of gastric dilatation and pneumoperitoneum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Resuscitation and surgical treatment are necessary in this life-threatening condition. The mortality rate can be as high as 80% in cases of incorrect diagnosis and delayed treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Our case was a hemiplegic, mentally and motor-retarded patient, and the diagnosis was based on physical examination and direct abdominal X-ray findings.\n\n【14】Acute gastric dilatation occurs mostly in women (67%) and is frequently found in the lesser curvature of the stomach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. AGD is also associated with a considerably high mortality rate (73%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In the present case, gastric necrosis due to AGD was detected in the greater curvature, fundus, and corpus of the stomach.\n\n【15】Resection of the gangrenous gastric part is essential in AGD. Usually, a total gastrectomy is required. Resection and esophagojejunostomy are successful under optimal conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 9\\]</u>. In cases of delayed treatment or with generalized peritonitis, decompression and drainage are recommended in addition to resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Total gastrectomy and esophagojejunostomy were performed on our case because necrosis was present in the fundus and greater curvature of the corpus and perforation was absent.\n\n【16】In conclusion, early diagnosis of gastric necrosis due to AGD is highly important due to the associated high morbidity and mortality rates. Gastric necrosis due to AGD must be considered in differential diagnosis to avoid late diagnosis in mentally retarded patients and patients with eating disorders.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is characterized by a long period after initial nephrectomy and a favorable prognosis compared to other pancreatic malignancies. Its diagnosis may confuse clinicians if the medical history is not known. In the era of targeted therapies for metastatic renal carcinoma, surgery stands as the best treatment option for PM of renal cancer. We report the case of a woman who underwent successfully left splenopancreatectomy for corporeal PM of renal cancer treated seven years ago. This case underlines the necessity of long-term follow-up of patients treated for kidney cancer.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】According to the GLOBOCAN database, 403000 people were diagnosed with kidney cancer during 2018. Among them, men were more hit (254000 new cases and 114000 deaths) than women (149000 new cases and 61000 deaths) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Renal cell carcinoma represents 3–5% of all adult malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, of which clear cell carcinoma represents the most frequent subtype (65–70%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In Tunisia, it is a less frequent cancer with 2.2 per 100000 incidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Pancreatic metastasis (PM) of renal cancer is even rarer. Surgical management of metachronous metastasis is a keypoint for this condition. In the present case, we report the case of a patient treated with a left splenopancreatectomy for metachronous pancreatic metastasis, seven years after nephrectomy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 60-year-old woman presented in April 2013 with gross hematuria. Physical examination revealed a left flank mass. The abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a renal tumor measuring 15 × 10 × 12 cm with capsular rupture, invasion of the left renal vein and of the vena cava in which a thrombus extended up to 7 cm. The thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) found the same tumor and four nonspecific pulmonary micronodules. This tumor was classified T3cN0M0.\n\n【7】The patient underwent a left total nephrectomy in the same month with a good clinical course. Histologic samples confirmed the diagnosis of a clear cell renal carcinoma classified as pT3cN0M0. She was put into surveillance, and annual CT scans confirmed the stability of the pulmonary nonspecific micronodules with no distant metastases.\n\n【8】After seven years, in November 2020, she consulted for abdominal pain without any other signs. The patient was in a good general condition. The physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【9】An abdominal sonography was performed revealing a deep hypoechogenic mass of the left flank linked to the tail of the pancreas measuring 7 × 4 cm with irregular outline and extending to the left border of the aorta.\n\n【10】The abdominal CT scan showed a multilobular mass, hypervascular on the arterial phase with arteriovenous fistula and wash-out on the venous phase. This mass obstructed the splenic vena and was responsible of a collateral venous circulation as well as of the atrophy of the tail of the pancreas . An abdominal MRI confirmed the same findings with a corporeal mass that had low signal in T1 Fat Sat images and hyperintense signal in T2 images . No further locations were found. A thoracic scan was performed and did not show any abnormality.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Computed tomography images of a tissular corporeal pancreatic mass, enhanced in periphery (a) with a central necrosis, invading the splenic vein (a, b).</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 MRI images of T1 fat saturation sequences with gadolinium injection in arterial (a) and portal (b) phases showing a tissular corporeal pancreatic mass, with low signal, enhanced in periphery, comprising a necrotic center with no involvement of the superior mesenteric artery.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 MRI T2 images of a heterogeneous hypersignal corporeal pancreatic mass.</u>\n\n【14】After discussion of this case in a multidisciplinary meeting, a left splenopancreatectomy was performed. Surgical samples showed a 50 × 40 mm red-whitish nodular tumoral neoformation of the tail and body of the pancreas with some necrotic changes. Postoperative recovery was eventful.\n\n【15】The histological examination revealed a malignant proliferation in the pancreatic parenchyma made of cordonal, trabecular, and alveolar anastomotic structures. These structures were arranged into a fibrohyaline stroma comprising a rich vascular network, punctuated by an inflammatory infiltrate with punctiform necrotic changes. Tumoral cells possess a clear cytoplasm. Nuclei were often irregular with visible nucleolus. The tumor did not invade the peripancreatic fat. The study concluded to a pancreatic metastasis of renal cell carcinoma without metastatic lymph nodes .\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 (a) (GX400) Clear cell carcinoma with a regular network of small and thin walled blood vessels.

Discussion\n\n【20】In renal cell carcinoma, major metastatic sites are the lungs (45.2%), bones (29.5%), lymph nodes (21.8%), liver (20.3%), and adrenals (8.9%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, despite pancreatic involvement is not frequent, RCC is the most common primary tumor leading to pancreatic metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Pancreatic metastasis (PM) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) incidence in autopsy series is reported between 1% and 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. They are also a rare pancreatic disease and represent about 2% of all pancreatic malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Epidemiologic data on primary tumor location (left or right kidney) and PM location on the pancreas found no correlation and pleaded in favor of a hematogenous dissemination of the disease rather than a lymphogenous local spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. By a biochemical phenomenon of tumor cell selection, emboli metastatic cells only develop in the pancreatic parenchyma but not in other organs, explaining why PM is usually unique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Later developing metastases in remote organs are due to the heterogeneity of the primary tumor, which spreads genetically different cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Clinically, pancreatic metastases are usually asymptomatic as 55% of them show no symptoms and are discovered in surveillance imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Very often, this condition is discovered a long period after initial nephrectomy, at a median interval of 91 months 通用删除7(英):<u>(54–142)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This finding underlines the necessity of long-time follow-up of renal cancer patients. Metachronous disease is rarer, and its incidence is estimated at 12% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【24】When symptomatic, patients may experience nausea, jaundice, acute pancreatitis, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, or weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【25】PM is characterized in computed tomography (CT) by its isodensity or hypodensity unenhanced images and by its avidity for enhancement in the late arterial phase as well as a wash-out in late phases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Similar findings were described on MRI, lesions having low signal in T1 images and are hyperintense in T2 images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Pancreatic lesions are more often multiple when they are secondary to kidney cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, and the multifocal presentation of pancreatic metastases to kidney cancer represents between 20% and 45% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Multifocality and the pattern of enhancement are the key findings that differentiate primary from secondary pancreatic lesions.\n\n【28】Some PMs have an intense octreotide uptake in scintigraphy which may distort the diagnosis, confusing with neuroendocrine tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, usually, these tumours do not invade neither the choledochus nor the pancreatic duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【29】The surgical management of metastatic renal cell cancer has changed in recent years with the development of target therapies and immunotherapy. Resection of metachronous metastases is more commonly described than synchronous metastases. For metachronous metastases, it is now consensual that surgery is the optimal treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In a series of 274 patients with PM (both metachronous and synchronous), Grassi et al. found that patients locally treated had a doubled median OS compared with patients with systemic treatment with targeted therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Atypical resection is preferred to typical techniques because oncologic results are comparable when removing only the metastasis and protecting the endocrine and exocrine function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The decision of surgery instead of systemic drugs is motivated by an excellent prognosis of these patients as overall survival at 5 years is estimated at 72.6% in a meta-analysis of 311 patients with PM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. It is suggested that patients suffering from PM of RCC present a less aggressive disease. Kalra et al. studied retrospectively 228 metastatic RCC in both PM and non-PM patients. The PM cohort was associated with a better prognosis than the other cohort, with a similar otherwise metastatic distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Very few cases have been reported of surgery performed for synchronous disease, but the surgical management of these lesions is still under debate. Nevertheless, it should be performed along with nephrectomy, whenever the patient is fit, and PM, the only site involved, as a persistent kidney tumor may be a source of potential new metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【30】The place of targeted therapies remains uncertain, as no data are currently available on their usefulness in patients with PM alone. The good results of surgery in terms of overall survival lead us to consider their use only after surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Prognostic factors reported in the literature are symptomatic metastases, surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>, nephrectomy, and good or intermediate Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) score that were related to survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【32】In summary, metachronous PM of RCC occurs late in the disease natural history, highlighting the necessity of long-term surveillance. It is associated with a good prognosis, and its treatment is based on the surgery of the metastases.\n\n【33】However, it is important to highlight that more than 20% of patients have metastatic disease at presentation, and early screening is necessary.

Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) is a rare clinical disorder, and diagnosing it can be challenging. Most of the patients present with predominant facial, oculo-bulbar, and neck muscle weakness along with respiratory muscle involvement. Such a presentation can be mistaken for bulbar onset motor neuron disease or as one of the rare oculopharyngeal myopathies. Case Report. We present a young female patient, who reported to us with neck muscle weakness, ocular and bulbar muscle paralysis, and breathing difficulty. She had been healthy till she was prescribed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) tablets (400 mg per day) for a malar rash. By the end of the second week after commencing the HCQ therapy, she developed the muscle weakness. Her symptoms began to regress after stopping HCQ and starting steroids, pyridostigmine, and, subsequently, azathioprine. She was negative for anticholinesterase receptor antibodies (AChR-Ab) but was positive for MuSK antibodies (MuSK-Ab). Conclusion. This report proves that MuSK-MG can also be unmasked by HCQ administration. Awareness of drug-induced/-unmasked MG is important, as failure to do so may result in a severe morbidity and a fatal outcome. The offending drug has to be promptly discontinued, and appropriate treatment should be instituted.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) or seronegative MG is a distinct subtype of MG affecting 5–8% of all MG patients. MuSK antibodies belong to the IgG4 class of immunoglobulins, which act by direct inhibition of protein function and AChR clustering 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Hydroxychloroquine is an immunomodulatory agent which is employed by dermatologists for treating lupus erythematosis. This paper presents the case report of a patient who had been prescribed HCQ elsewhere for a malar rash. She developed myasthenic symptoms which was confirmed to be of the MuSK-Mg type, while being on the drug for two weeks. It is well known that HCQ can potentially worsen or unmask MG in a susceptible individual. Prompt identification of the undesirable side effect of HCQ and institution of appropriate treatment relieved her of her myasthenic symptoms.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 34-year-old female university lecturer was admitted for bilateral asymmetrical drooping of eyelids with double vision of 4 weeks duration. She also had fluctuating neck muscle weakness which she thought was due to the long hours of online teaching. However, a few days later, her symptoms became progressively worse. Furthermore, she developed dysphonia, dysphagia, and generalized muscle weakness with shortness of breath on exertion.\n\n【6】On enquiry, she admitted to the fact that she had recently developed maculo-papular rash over her cheeks which was diagnosed as photosensitivity rash. The attending dermatologist prescribed her hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg per day orally which she took for two weeks prior to the emergence of the neurological symptoms. She had no significant past medical illnesses except for 2 episodes of acute simple cystitis that resolved with a single dose of oral fosfomycin, and on both the occasions, no myasthenic symptoms were precipitated. Fosfomycin is a phosphonic acid derivative and has not been listed as an agent that aggravates or triggers myasthenic symptoms in a susceptible individual.\n\n【7】On examination, she was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min. Her oxygen saturation was fluctuating between 86% and 92% necessitating nasal oxygen administration. She had neck muscle weakness and asymmetrical external ophthalmoplegia . Swallowing function was impaired resulting in choking for fluids. There was fluctuating muscle fatigue and double vision on various eye gaze positions. The proximal limb muscle power over both upper and lower limbs was 3/5, and she was unable to sit upright for long. The deep tendon reflexes and sensory examination were normal.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Bilateral partial ptosis with overaction of the frontalis muscle.</u>\n\n【9】Based on the history and clinical signs and symptoms, a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was made. This was substantiated by the repetitive nerve stimulation test, wherein at 1 Hz rate stimulation, the orbicularis oculi muscles showed a decremental response consistent with the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis . The AChR antibody titer was reported to be normal, whereas the MuSK antibody titer was high. Computed tomography (CT) of her thorax did not show any thymic enlargement. Blood tests for connective tissue disorders such as the antinuclear antibody (ANA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) were negative.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Decremental response of 10% seen on repetitive stimulation of the facial nerve.</u>\n\n【11】Based on the suspicion of HCQ-triggered myasthenia, the patient was asked to stop the HCQ tablet. She was treated concomitantly with intravenous methylprednisolone (1 gram) daily for 5 days followed by oral prednisolone (30 mg) daily along with pyridostigmine tablet (60 mg) thrice a day. After 10 days, the prednisolone dose was gradually tapered off, and oral azathioprine (50 mg daily) was started. This clinical presentation prompted us to arrive at a final diagnosis of MuSK- MG unmasked by HCQ treatment.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common type of neuromuscular transmission disease, and 85% of the patients have autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) is reported in about 5–8% of MG patients and MuSK.\n\n【14】Antibodies are detected in approximately 37% of generalized AChR antibody-negative myasthenia gravis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【15】This disease is predominantly seen in females in their 3<sup>rd</sup> decade with prominent facial and bulbar involvement and more frequent crises. The onset is usually acute with rapid progression within a few weeks. Bulbar muscle involvement has been demonstrated in up to 80% of the MuSK-MG patients, resulting in dysarthria, dysphonia with nasal voice, dysphagia, and masticatory difficulty. Severe neck muscle weakness presenting as head drop is a feature in Musk-MG. Thus, the patient may be easily misdiagnosed as having bulbar onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, or mitochondrial myopathy.\n\n【16】Case reports on chloroquine-induced MG have appeared in the literature ever since 1981, and most patients have had symptomatic recovery and the disappearance of the AChR antibody after withdrawing chloroquine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Varan et al. in 2015 reported a patient diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus developing myasthenia gravis due to hydroxychloroquine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, when HCQ has been widely used as prophylactic treatment, Elavarsi and Goyal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> reported the exacerbation of myasthenic symptoms in a young AChR-positive myasthenic lady treated with HCQ and emphasized the need for awareness of the possibility of HCQ-induced MG. In 2012, Jallouli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> published a case series of 17 patients with MG and SLE with a special focus regarding hydroxychloroquine usage. It was found that in 8 patients, myasthenia occurred after the initiation of HCQ for the treatment of SLE. However, only one of them was presumed to be due to HCQ, and this patient had a rapid development of myasthenic symptoms though not associated with antibodies against AChR. There was resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of the drug; however, rechallenge with HCQ was not done. Chloroquine, a precursor of HCQ, has been associated with the emergence of myasthenia through production of AChR antibodies causing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) leading to exacerbation of MG through direct effect on neuromuscular transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】HCQ has been used for several decades for various connective tissue diseases, and it has gained popularity over the last one year as a drug for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. These classes of drugs prevent the biocrystallization of heme and impaired neuromuscular transmission both at the presynaptic and postsynaptic levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A systematic review by Sheikh et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> summarizes the various drugs which can cause de novoMG, MG exacerbation, or MG-like symptoms in nonmyasthenic patients.\n\n【18】Whether HCQ can trigger MuSK-MG is also not clearly known, and no reports on such cases have been forthcoming in the literature. Therefore, our case is a rare presentation of MuSK-MG being unmasked by HCQ.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】Our case is rather unique, and it proves to show that HCQ can unmask MuSK-MG also, which has not been hitherto reported in the literature. From a clinical perspective, it is of utmost importance for the treating physician to be aware of such adverse effects of certain drugs such as HCQ and their consequences on the neuromuscular junction. The possibility of MuSK-MG should be entertained in AChR-Ab-negative MG patients, and antibody titer estimation for the MuSK antibody should be performed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We report a rare case of a 76-year-old man who presented with a three-month history of right flank dullness and was noted to have a nonhomogeneous retroperitoneal mass with hydronephrosis of the right kidney on computed tomography of the abdomen. Computed tomography of the thorax showed a nodule in the lower lobe, measuring 3 × 2  cm, in the right lung. After excluding the presence of other primary tumors and metastases, we reached a final diagnosis of solitary retroperitoneal metastasis of adenocarcinoma of the lung. Although rare, in patients of non-small cell lung cancer, presence of hydronephrosis should alert the physician to the possibility of metastasis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death for both genders. At the time of diagnosis, only 20% of all lung cancer patients will have local disease, while 55% will have distant metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The brain is the most common site of metastases of lung cancer followed by the bones, liver, and adrenal glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However, ureteral obstruction caused by metastases of lung cancer is extremely rare. Here we report a unique case of metastatic ureteral involvement of non-small cell lung cancer which was the first clinical evidence of the underlying malignancy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 76-year-old man presented with a three-month history of right flank dullness. He had not had any respiratory symptoms, and no malignancies had been diagnosed. He did not smoke tobacco. Physical examination results were mostly normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a non-homogeneous retroperitoneal mass with hydronephrosis of the right kidney. CT of the thorax showed a soft tissue density nodule with spiculated margins and vascular convergence in the lower lobe, measuring 3 × 2  cm, in the right lung . These morphologic characteristics on CT scans were suspicious for primary lung cancer. CT of the head and bone scan were negative for metastases. Laboratory data, including those for prostate-specific antigen, α\\-fetoprotein, β\\-human chorionic gonadotropin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, were within normal limits except for elevated serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL (normal, 0.6 mg/dL–1.1 mg/dL). Urinalysis results were also normal.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Computed tomography of the thorax showed a soft tissue density nodule with spiculated margins and vascular convergence in the lower lobe, measuring 3 × 2  cm, in the right lung. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】A right retrograde ureterogram showed a continuous extrinsic obstruction, 7 cm in length, of the middle third of the ureter . The results of cytologic assessment of urine specimens collected from the right ureter were normal. T1-weighted magnetic resonance images demonstrated a retroperitoneal mass, measuring 3 × 3 × 5  cm, with compression of the inferior vena cava 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. Enhancement by gadolinium-diethylenetetraminepentaacetic acid of the T1-weighted images showed a high-intensity rim 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b))</u>. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed that a luminal mass caused obstruction of the bronchi and was used for brushing of the lesion for cytologic evaluation of the specimens, which showed the tumor to be a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. CT-guided fine needle biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass was performed, and the pathological examination indicated a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with fibrosis . The pathological features were consistent with metastasis of adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | A right retrograde ureterogram showed a continuous extrinsic obstruction of the middle third of the ureter (arrowheads). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | (a) T1-weighted magnetic resonance images demonstrated a retroperitoneal mass (arrowheads) with compression of the inferior vena (arrow).

Subsequent occurrence of many small lung nodules, which may be consistent with metastatic disease, was not observed. Chemotherapy was initiated, but the patient died as a result of compression of the inferior vena cava by the retroperitoneal metastasis 6 months later after the diagnosis.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Hematogenous or lymphatic metastases from a distant primary neoplasm to the ureter are encountered infrequently. Babaian et al. reported 37 (0.3%) of 11,689 patients with malignant disease had histologically proved metastatic lesions to the ureter in a large series of autopsies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The rarity of their occurrence probably reflects the segmental distribution of the blood and lymphatic vessels in the ureter and periureteral sheath, resulting in the absence of continuous longitudinal networks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Secondarily, the lymph drainage of the ureter of the lower portion of the ureter is downward and counterdirectional to that of the pelvic organ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The primary sites include stomach, colon, uterine cervix, breast, skin, prostate, lung, and adrenal gland. In the autopsy data, metastases to the ureter was found in 2 (0.2%) of 1281 lung cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【14】In the majority of cases, the presence of ureteral metastases is not either diagnosed or suspected prior to death. Early symptoms of ureteral metastases may be masked by the overbearing presence of the primary tumor or other metastases, or by the generally poor condition of the patient. In the present case, metastatic ureteral involvement of non-small cell lung cancer was the first clinical evidence of the underlying malignancy.\n\n【15】Radiographic findings of extrinsic ureteral obstruction due to metastatic diseases depend on the pattern of the tumoral spread: hematogenous submucosal/mucosal metastasis, hematogenous adventitia metastases spreading along periureteral vessels, scirrhous metastatic spread along periureteral vessels, or metastatic spread into lymph nodes with perinodal desmoplastic reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The present case demonstrated the scirrhous spread pattern, which is seen especially in adenocarcinomas of the prostate, stomach, and colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Accurate determination of the extent of disease is critical in patients with lung cancer, as it has implications for both prognosis and treatment. The choice of surgical biopsy technique for diagnostic confirmation depends on many factors, for example, the size and anatomic location of the mass, and the overall estimated risk of malignancy. It should also be considered that the metastatic cells are usually dispersed diffusely in fibrotic plaque. In our case, multiple fine-needle aspiration biopsies of the retroperitoneal mass under CT guidance could establish the diagnosis and avoid unnecessary surgical exploration.\n\n【17】In patients of lung cancer, presence of hydronephrosis should alert the clinician to the possibility of metastasis and subsequent evaluation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It occurs as a result of accidental implantations of fungus during traumatic procedures, such as surgery, and is usually reported in patients with predisposing factors such as immunosuppression, malignancy, and drug abuse. If left untreated, irreversible deformity and pain with severe osteoarticular destruction occur. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment are important. This paper presents a case of 72-year-old man with primary C. guilliermondii infection of knee joint without predisposing factors and previous traumatic procedures, who was misdiagnosed with advanced degenerative osteoarthritis. Our case is the second case of primary C. guilliermondii arthritis of knee to be reported in the English-language literature and the first to be successfully treated with total knee arthroplasty following IV amphotericin B and oral fluconazole. Primary candidal infection of joint is generally asymptomatic or involves only mild pain and swelling in the affected knee. Thus, although the majority of knee joint infections are of a pyogenic or tuberculous origin, if a patient complains of mild pain and swelling in the knee and has mild signs of infection, the possibility of fungal infection should be considered.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Candidal infection of knee joint is rare. It is primarily reported in immunosuppressed patients as a sequela of prior episodes of transient candidemia or as a result of disseminated disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In the majority of cases, candidal arthritis is the result of hematogenous dissemination. Primary candidal infection of joint is extremely rare, with only a few reported cases. It most often occurs as a result of accidental implantation of fungus during traumatic procedures, such as surgery, intra-articular injections, or implantation of infected joint prostheses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>, and also in human-immunodeficiency-virus-(HIV)-infected intravenous drug users 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u> and heroin addicts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. While some Candida species, including C. albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. lusitaniae, have been incriminated in the etiology of osteoarticular infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–14\\]</u>, C. guilliermondii joint infection has been reported only once, by Graham and Frost 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, the case reported by Graham and Frost occurred in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis, which is one of the minor predisposing factors for candidal infection of joint.\n\n【4】Here we report a case of primary C. guilliermondii infection of the knee joint in a patient without predisposing factors that was successfully treated by total knee arthroplasty following intravenous amphotericin B and oral fluconazole. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the second case of primary C. guilliermondii infection of joint reported in the English-language literature, and the first in a patient without predisposing factors. Additionally, ours is the first reported case to be successfully treated by total knee arthroplasty following intravenous amphotericin B and oral fluconazole in case of candidal joint infection.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 72-year-old man presented to our clinic with a 1-year history of pain and swelling of the right knee. He had been having intermittent pain in both knees for 15 years. Medication for mild degenerative arthritis had been recommended, but the patient refused treatment. A year before he presented to our clinic, he visited another clinic due to the aggravation of pain and swelling of the right knee and was diagnosed with severe degenerative arthritis by radiologic and physical exam, and a decision was made to perform total knee arthroplasty. During the operation, severe inflammation and an abscess were found inside the knee joint; therefore, bacterial culture was obtained and arthroplasty was not performed. After the operation, he was diagnosed by culture with unknown-originated joint infection and transferred to our clinic. The medical history was negative for rheumatoid disease, cancer, renal disease, and HIV. He was a nonsmoker and nondrinker and did not take any steroids or illegal drugs. On physical examination, the patient had signs of infection, including swelling and localized warmth, of right knee. Knee radiographs revealed multiple patched subchondral lesions of the distal femur and proximal tibia, severe joint space narrowing, and definite osteophytes 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. These findings were suggestive of a degenerative knee joint (K-L grade IV).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Standing knee radiograph showed multiple patched subchondral lesions of the distal femur and proximal tibia, joint space narrowing, and definite osteophyte. (b) After disappearing of the infection sign, standing knee radiograph showed aggravation of intra-articular deformity. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】The laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell (WBC), 11,200/mm<sup>3</sup> (4–10 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>); erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 97 mm/hr (0–15 mm/hr); C-reactive protein (CRP), 19.2 mg/dL (0–5 mg/dL). Tests for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and HLA B<sub>27</sub> were all negative. The joint fluid cytology findings were as follows: appearance, cloudy and reddish; WBC, 17,200/mm<sup>3</sup> (0–200/mm<sup>3</sup>) with 85% neutrophils and 10% lymphocytes. The Gram stain and acid-fast bacteria (AFB) stain showed no bacteria or tuberculosis. Candida guilliermondii was cultured in the joint fluid on hospital day 7 and was confirmed on hospital day 8. Amphotericin B (0.7 mg/kg/day) was given intravenously. Two weeks later, CRP had normalized. After 4 weeks, the amphotericin B was discontinued and oral fluconazole (400 mg/day) was prescribed for 6 months. The last culture of joint fluid was negative for C. guilliermondii, and the patient had no complaints of pain or swelling. The ESR/CRP was continuously maintained at normal state. After the inflammation had resolved, the patient had pain on the medial side of the knee joint with ambulation, and rechecking knee radiographs revealed aggravation of the patient’s intra-articular deformity due to the candidal infection 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. After 4 months, primary total knee replacement with a Duracon prosthesis (Howmedica, Rutherford, NJ, USA) was performed . The wound was daily dressed, and intravenous amphotericin was injected; however, redness and swelling were observed at the proximal operative site 1 week postoperatively .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Primary total knee replacement with the Duracon prosthesis (Howmedica, Rutherford, NJ, USA) was performed. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | (a) Superficial infection at proximal operative site was noted at postoperative week 2.

So far, after discharge, there were no abnormal findings or signs of infection.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】In our patient, infection of the knee joint occurred without predisposing factors, such as autoimmune disease, HIV, chronic steroid use, cancer, or drug abuse; therefore, most clinicians suspected pyogenic or tuberculosis infection and did not consider fungal infection because it rarely occurs in normal population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Only a few cases of primary candidal infection have been reported. In our knowledge, primary candidal infection has been reported in less than 15 cases, mostly in neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>, septicemic patients, HIV patients, and drug abusers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. While only some Candida species have been incriminated in the etiology of osteoarticular infections, C. guilliermondii has been reported only one time, by Graham and Frost 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Graham reported that a patient with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis presented with mild knee pain and swelling and suggested that the unusualness organism, of the apparent chronicity of the infection, and the ultimate success of the surgical treatment are features of this organism. However, that case occurred in a patient of rheumatoid arthritis with systemic corticosteroid, which is one of predisposing factors.\n\n【14】Disseminated Candida infection manifest with systemic symptoms including cutaneous and ocular lesions, so early diagnosis and treatment are possible. However, primary candidal infection of joint usually has mild, chronic course with little pain and few articular symptoms, leading to delays in diagnosis that can be as long as several years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 18\\]</u>. Due to these ambiguous symptoms, primary candidal infection is often misdiagnosed as simple degenerative osteoarthritis of the knee, as in this case. However, if left untreated, irreversible deformity and pain with severe osteoarticular destruction occur. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment are important. Thus, if there are minimal infectious signs, careful physical examination and attentive analysis of blood and joint fluid should be conducted to avoid incorrect diagnosis and treatment. In addition, because the majority of knee joint infections are of a pyogenic or tuberculous origin, most physicians do not perform the study about fungus infection. Thus, if there is an ambiguous case, which shows mild pain, swelling, and infection sign, a study about fungal infection should be also done.\n\n【15】Definitive information on the treatment of native joint Candida infection is limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Both amphotericin B and fluconazole have been successfully used to treat infection with susceptible strains, as long as adequate drainage is provided 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Because successful treatment with amphotericin B is more commonly reported, we initiated treatment with intravenous amphotericin B, which was changed to oral fluconazole 4 weeks later. A long-term survey of Candida demonstrated that fluconazole has fewer side effects and better antifungal effects than amphotericin B 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Therefore, we prescribed fluconazole for 6 months. Six months later, neither signs of inflammation nor side effects were observed.\n\n【16】As determined by a search of Medline for articles between 1966 and January 2011, our case is the second case of primary C. guilliermondii infection of knee joint to be reported in the English-language literature and the first to be successfully treated with total knee arthroplasty following IV amphotericin B and oral fluconazole. Primary candidal infection of joint is generally asymptomatic or involves only mild pain and swelling in the affected knee. Thus, if a patient complains of mild pain and swelling in the knee and has mild signs of infection, the possibility of fungal infection should be considered.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】Primary candidal infection of joint is extremely rare, with only a few reported cases. This infection is generally asymptomatic or involves only mild pain and swelling in the affected knee. However, if left untreated, irreversible deformity and pain with severe osteoarticular destruction occur. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment are important.

Case Report\n\n【5】A previously healthy 67-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 15-year history of widespread skin lesions. She had recurrent pruritic papular eruptions and slowly progressing brownish lentigo-like macules. The skin lesions began on the trunk and then became generalized, involving the extensor and flexural surfaces of extremities, including the back of the hands, neck, and trunk. Clinical examination revealed numerous generalized symmetrically distributed brownish macules and some pruritic, hyperkeratotic, erythematous papules . The face, palms, and soles were spared, and she had no nail, hair, teeth, or mucosal alterations. There was no atrophic or hypopigmented lesions. No family history of similar lesions was known. She was previously treated with topical corticosteroids without improvement. Laboratory examinations demonstrated no abnormalities. Histopathologic examination of three biopsy specimens revealed digitiform epithelial downgrowths of the rete ridges, with hyperpigmentation of the basal layer confined to the tips of the rete ridges. Multiple foci of suprabasilar acantholysis were also observed  and a mixed dermal inflammatory infiltrate. In one of the biopsy specimens, we found acantholytic and dyskeratotic cells 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>.

Discussion\n\n【10】Galli-Galli disease is a benign but very pruritic and unaesthetic genodermatosis. Its mode of inheritance is believed to be autosomal dominant with variable penetrance, but it can occur sporadically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, as in our patient. As with DDD it is believed to be linked to mutations in the KRT5 gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Clinically it is characterized by reticulated hyperpigmentation predominantly affecting the flexures along with pruritic, erythematous, scaly papules, similar to the DDD. Histopathologic examination reveals digitiform elongation of the rete ridges seen in DDD, together with suprabasal focal acantholysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–9\\]</u>.\n\n【11】A few patients have been described in the literature. A literature search revealed 9 previous case reports of GGD, with a total of 17 patients . According to the reported cases, the age range of presentation is 15 to 67 years, 11 patients were male, and 6 were female. All the patients in the reports had reticulated hyperpigmentation in the flexural areas, with the exception of one. In our patient, the characteristic hyperpigmentation of the axillae and inguinal region could not be detected, rendering a diagnosis of GGD difficult.\n\n【12】Table 1 Reported cases of Galli-Galli disease.\n\n【13】In 15 of the 17 cases a skin biopsy was performed, and in all of this cases acantholysis was identified, but dyskeratosis was present in only 3 cases. In our case we also identified dyskeratotic cells in one of the fragments, closely resembling features of Darier’s or Grover’s diseases. However, Darier’s disease could be ruled out by the presence of areas of digitate proliferations of the rete ridges, clinically it starts early, lentigo-like macules are rare, and it is commonly associated with nail and mucous membrane involvement that was absent in our patient. In Grover’s disease involvement of the distal extremities, as in our patient, and the presence of brown lentigo-like macules are not common.

Initial treatment with pulsed corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, and cyclosporine seemed to suppress the activity of interstitial lung disease temporarily, but signs of relapse were detected such as elevation of serum KL-6 level and progressing pulmonary shadows in chest computed tomography scan. After polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column treatment, the areas of pulmonary shadows drastically decreased. Gradually, arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio recovered, and serum ferritin level and KL-6 level decreased. These findings indicate that polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column treatment could be promising in combination with conventional therapy for rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia associated with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis, especially at the early phase of relapse.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic connective tissue disease which is characterized by inflammation of the muscles and the skin. It is also a systemic disease involving the joints, esophagus, lungs, and heart. Clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (C-ADM) is characterized by typical cutaneous manifestations and minor involvement of skeletal muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is well known that the interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with C-ADM often presents with rapid onset and progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and that the type of ILD is resistant to conventional therapy and has a poor prognosis especially in East Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】It has been reported that direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column (PMX) effectively removed circulating endotoxin both in vitro and in vivo studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It was initially developed as a treatment for sepsis, and it has also revealed favorable effects on arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio in acute respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Here, we describe a patient of rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia associated with C-ADM whose relapse after intensive conventional therapy was successfully treated with PMX hemoperfusion.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 37-year-old man presented with skin rash for the last two months. He also had progressing dyspnea for the last two weeks and visited a hospital to consult with a physician. His oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was as low as 91% at room air in resting state, and he was admitted to the hospital. He had skin rashes in the face and on the hands. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed nonsegmental pulmonary infiltrate and grand-glass opacity mainly distributed in the subpleural areas of the lower lobes. In addition, there were some legions of consolidation with air bronchogram in the peripheral lung, which implied traction bronchiectasis. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis showed increases in total cells ( /mL) and lymphocyte fraction (64.5%). Culture of BALF was negative. In transbronchial lung biopsy samples, lymphocytes and macrophages was infiltrated, and masson body-like fibrotic foci was formed.\n\n【7】He was suspected of rapidly progressing interstitial lung disease with dermatomyositis and transferred to our hospital. He had Gottron’s papules, mechanic’s hands, and spotted rashes between eyebrows, but he did not have heliotrope rash or other rashes on joints or body trunk. Manual muscle testing revealed no muscle weakness both in proximal and distal muscles. Fine crackles were audible in the bilateral lower lung fields. Laboratory findings on admission revealed a white blood cell count of 4,200/mm<sup>3</sup> with 76.1% neutrophils C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (3.21 mg/dL \\[standard value; 0–0.4 mg/dL\\]). His serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), KL-6, ferritin, aldolase, and D-Dimer levels were elevated (586 IU/L \\[119–229 IU/L\\]), 1835 U/mL \\[<500 U/mL\\], 842 ng/mL \\[20–280 ng/mL\\], 14.1 U/L \\[2.7–7.5 U/L\\], and 12.4 μg/mL \\[<1.0 μg/mL\\], resp.), but creatine kinase (CK) was not elevated (201 U/L \\[55-210 U/L\\]). He did not have antinuclear antibody, anti-Jo-1 antibody, or other anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with the patient’s serum revealed that he had a 140 kD protein band, which is supposed to be C-ADM-140/MDA5 antibody; however, further determination was not available in our case. Arterial blood gas test at O<sub>2</sub> inhalation of 3 L/min with nasal cannula revealed decreased levels of PaO<sub>2</sub> (68.7 Torr) and PaCO<sub>2</sub> (31.7 Torr). Plasma b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was <4.0 pg/mL \\[<18.4 pg/mL\\], and ultrasound cardiography revealed that his cardiac function was normal. Skin biopsy was performed, and the findings were compatible with dermatomyositis. Electromyogram or magnetic resonance imaging of thigh muscles was omitted because respiratory failure was progressing and the treatment was made the highest priority. There were no signs of malignancy so far as we could check.\n\n【8】He was diagnosed as clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (C-ADM) with rapidly progressing interstitial pneumonia and treated with pulsed corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g/day, days 0–3, 16–18) followed by high dose corticosteroids, intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY; 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, day 3, 22; 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, day 41), intravenous immunoglobulin (20 g/day, days 6–10, 48–52), and cyclosporine-A (CSA; 200 mg/day, days 0–5; 250–300 mg/day, days 6-). Anticoagulation treatment with heparin followed by warfarin was also used (days 0-). In response to these initial treatments, consolidations and grand-glass opacities decreased in chest CT scans . Oxygen demand decreased from 4 L/min to 1-2 L/min to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> level at 90–95% in resting state. However, serum ferritin kept increasing and began to decrease two weeks afterwards.\n\n【9】On day 29, chest CT scans revealed progressing interstitial shadows again . CK was not elevated (130 U/L). Plasma BNP was slightly elevated (26.9 pg/mL), but there were no signs of heart failure. Although his oxygen demand or respiratory symptoms had not changed significantly, we thought that his interstitial lung disease was relapsing. Since a relapse after initial treatment of rapidly progressive ILD is often fatal, we decided to conduct intensive care in this early phase of the relapse, thus applied hemoperfusion treatment in this moment. On days 30 and 31, he underwent single course of PMX treatment, which was carried out at a flow rate of 80–100 mL/min for 12 h, twice at an interval of 24 h. Nafamostat mesilate (Torii Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used for anticoagulation. Following the hemoperfusion, the findings detected by chest X-ray and CT scans improved remarkably, and the serum ferritin kept decreasing. Oxygen demand improved gradually, reflected in the increase in arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio (from 215 to 313), whereas serum concentration of LDH and KL-6 still remained at high level . The dosage of oral corticosteroid was tapered gradually, and he was discharged with a prescription of 30 mg of prednisolone and 250 mg of cyclosporine. He was treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide repeatedly. There has been no recurrence in him for 6 months after the discharge.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Time course of medical treatments and changes in the lab data before and after treatment.

Discussion\n\n【13】We report a case of rapidly progressive ILD with C-ADM, whose relapse in spite of intensive therapy was successfully prevented by PMX hemoperfusion. We think that PMX is a potent therapeutic option in combination with the conventional treatment, especially in the early phase of the relapse of the ILD with C-ADM.\n\n【14】Acute/subacute interstitial lung disease in patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) is frequently fatal within months despite high dose prednisolone (PSL) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Acute/subacute ILD is more common in patients with C-ADM, which results in higher mortality rate in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is often resistant to conventional therapy and has poor prognosis especially in East Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. It was reported that HRCT patterns differed between anti-C-ADM-140 positive and negative patients in DM; lower lobes consolidation or ground-glass attenuation (GGA) pattern (50.0%) and random GGA pattern (33.3%) were the predominant patterns, and intralobular reticular opacities were absent in anti-C-ADM-140 positive cases, while lower lobes reticulation pattern (69.2%) was frequently seen in anti-C-ADM-140 negative cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. NSIP and DAD were seen in histological examinations of acute/subacute ILD with C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Furthermore, C-ADM-associated interstitial pneumonia takes an aggressive course even when the radiological and histological features are consistent with NSIP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In the present case, the radiological features were mostly consistent with lower lobes consolidation or GGA pattern, and there was traction bronchiectasis on admission, which is a predictor of rapid progression and poor prognosis of ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>; therefore he received intensive initial treatment with pulsed corticosteroids and IVCY, intravenous immunoglobulin, oral CSA, and warfarin.\n\n【15】It was reported that combination therapy with pulsed corticosteroids, CSA, and IVCY was promising for acute/subacute ILD with DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It was reported that early intervention with CSA in combination with corticosteroid was effective, with tightly monitoring 2 h postdose blood concentration (C2) of CSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 13\\]</u>. In this case, we also used CSA as an initial treatment and monitored trough as well as C2 level of CSA. There are reports that intravenous immunoglobulin is effective for ILD with DM/PM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>, and we also applied it twice with an interval of a month.\n\n【16】Although pulmonary coagulopathy is suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of ILD, effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy for ILD is controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>. As a maintenance therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), warfarin had negative effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. On the other hand, anticoagulation is known to be beneficial in acute exacerbation of various ILDs including IPF and C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. In our case, the patient presented with elevated plasma D-Dimer on admission, which might have indicated thrombus formation in pulmonary microcirculation, and we decided to begin anticoagulant therapy as an acute phase treatment.\n\n【17】In the present case, the intensive initial treatment with pulsed corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide twice, respectively, intravenous immunoglobulin once, and oral cyclosporine and warfarin succeeded in the induction of the remission to the rapidly progressing ILD with C-ADM. However, relapse was suspected soon after the initial treatment as progressing interstitial shadows without any signs of heart dysfunction. Although CT findings at the time of suspected relapse were not so prominent, we judged thatitwas a critical time point to decide good or poor prognosis; thus we conducted polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column (PMX) treatment.\n\n【18】PMX treatment was initially developed as a treatment for sepsis by removing circulating endotoxin. It has also revealed favorable effects on (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio in acute respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The number of reports is limited, but it was also effective for rapidly progressing ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19–21\\]</u>. It has been reported that PMX treatment was also effective for ILD with C-ADM in combination with conventional treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22–24\\]</u>. Although there remains the possibility that the other immunosuppressants finally become effective, it seems that PMX played the major role in this case, since the progressing pulmonary infiltrates quickly cleared just after the PMX treatment.\n\n【19】However, the mechanism by which PMX improves pulmonary oxygenation in acute exacerbation of ILD (AE-ILD) has not been elucidated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The removal of plasma endotoxin does not have a major role, because serum levels of endotoxin were within the normal range in previously reported cases of AE-ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 22, 25–27\\]</u>. PMX treatment was known to reduce metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>, neutrophil reactive oxygen species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>, neutrophil elastase, and interleukin-8 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. These mediators cause lung injury and increase vascular permeability as well as the intrapulmonary shunt ratio. These mediators are known to be released from neutrophils and monocytes. It has been shown that the polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column itself traps activated blood neutrophils and monocytes, which may be involved in the reduction of releasing mediators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31–33\\]</u>. In our case, blood neutrophil count and monocyte count were not reduced after PMX treatment. The mechanism by which PMX treatment improved the ILD should be studied further. A long perfusion duration (12 h) of PMX had better prognosis than short course (<6 h) for AE-ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 25\\]</u>, and we also applied 12 h for a hemoperfusion duration.\n\n【20】It has been reported that serum ferritin correlates with the activity of the ILD with C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. In our case, serum ferritin kept increasing for about a week after initiating intensive immunosuppressive therapies and began to decrease afterwards. There seemed to be a time lag of approximately two weeks between the decline of disease activity and decrease of the serum ferritin level.\n\n【21】KL-6 is a mucin-like glycoprotein expressed on type II pneumocytes. Serum KL-6 level has diagnostic and prognostic significance in ILD or acute respiratory distress syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35, 36\\]</u>. It has better diagnostic accuracy of ILD in comparison to SP-A, SP-D, and MCP-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37, 38\\]</u>. Serum KL-6 is known to be elevated even 7–10 days after successful treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39, 40\\]</u>, which is compatible with our case.\n\n【22】Anticlinically amyopathic dermatomyositis- (C-ADM-) 140/MDA5 autoantibodies have been known to be a specific marker for C-ADM and strongly associated with rapidly progressive ILD with C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. Furthermore, their quantification may be useful for monitoring ILD activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.\n\n【23】In summary, we report a case of rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia associated with C-ADM, whose relapse after intensive initial treatment was successfully prevented with single course of PMX hemoperfusion. PMX may be a potent therapeutic option in combination with conventional therapies for ILD associated with C-ADM, especially in the early phase of the relapse.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The following clinical case was accompanied by renal insufficiency, which was associated with the obstruction of the right ureter in the hernial sac and the stenosis of the left renal artery. The differential diagnosis between nephroptosis and dystopic kidney was based on MDCT scan images, which demonstrated the length of the right renal artery to be more than 20 cm. The patient underwent percutaneous nephrostomy through the right inguinal area and was successfully followed up for two years. We also analyzed six similar clinical cases described in the literature. This disease has, thus far, been observed exclusively in elderly men with long-standing and large inguinal hernias. The most frequent complications in these patients include ureteral strangulation in the area of the hernial gate and renal failure.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Renal ptosis (floating kidney) is an uncommon urological disease that continues to cause controversies among clinicians, despite more than a century long history of research on this pathology. The disease has many unique peculiarities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. At the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, nephropexy was used to be one of the most widespread surgeries, as floating kidneys were considered to be the most frequent cause of abdominal pains, as well as certain neurological and psychiatric diseases. This explains the largest number of surgical techniques that were proposed for the correction of this particular surgical disease.\n\n【4】Another important feature is the fact that the degree of nephroptosis often does not correlate with the symptoms, with some patients experiencing severe pain despite minor renal displacement, while others with an expressed floating kidney showing no symptoms at all. In the management of patients with nephroptosis, one more point must be taken into account; despite significant progress in the field of visual and laboratory diagnostics, the differential diagnosis of pain associated with nephroptosis remains challenging in certain cases. Therefore, predicting the outcomes of surgical intervention in patients with nephroptosis is extremely difficult, as symptoms may persist despite the fixation of the kidney in its normal position.\n\n【5】The pathophysiological aspects of nephroptosis include the possible development of hydronephrosis due to ureteral obstruction and significant elongation of the renal vessels, leading to ischemic disorders or venous congestion in the kidney.\n\n【6】The most severe degree of renal ptosis is characterized by the kidney displacement of over three vertebral lengths and its localization in the pelvic cavity. The literature describes singular clinical observations of “extreme nephroptosis” when the floating kidney is located in the cavity of the inguinal-scrotal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>. In general, the inclusion of a parenchymal organ into an inguinal hernia is very rare. Such cases include the involvement of an ectopic testicle, ovary, uterus, accessory ectopic kidney, or transplanted kidney into the hernial sac 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【7】We present a rare clinical case of significant renal ptosis with the kidney located in the cavity of the inguinal-scrotal hernia, which caused significant ureteral obstruction and required drainage of the pyelocaliceal system by percutaneous nephrostomy passed through the scrotum.\n\n【8】This case report has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 93-year-old patient was admitted by the ambulance to the Regional Urological Clinical Center with complaints of a decrease in the urine output to 200 ml per day during the last three days, fever up to 38°С, mild pain in the right half of the scrotum area, and the general condition deterioration. There were no delays prior to the patient’s assessment and subsequent treatment. The anamnesis revealed, that two months ago, he had a permanent urethral Foley catheter installed due to chronic urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). His past medical history included ischemic heart disease (with a myocardial infarction seven years ago), hypertension, and urolithiasis. In addition, five years ago, he experienced an ischemic cerebral stroke resulting in persistent left-side paraparesis.\n\n【11】The patient’s general condition was assessed as severe. The patient was confused. The physical examination revealed large bilateral inguinal-scrotal hernias that he had been suffering from for the past 20 years. The abdomen was soft on palpation, moderately painful in the right iliac and suprapubic areas. There was mild tenderness during the palpation of the right half of the scrotum.\n\n【12】The patient’s general blood count revealed leukocytosis (12 х 10<sup>9</sup>/L) with a shift in the leucocyte formula towards young forms and moderate anemia (Hb: 104 g/L; erythrocytes: 3.6 х 10<sup>12</sup> g/L). The levels of creatinine and blood urea reached 240 µmol/L and 14.8 mmol/L, respectively.\n\n【13】Ultrasonography revealed that the right kidney was located in the right half of the scrotum, with dimensions measuring 138 × 65 mm and a renal parenchyma thickness of 18–20 mm. There was significant extension of the pelvicalyceal system up to the level of the upper third of the ureter. The left kidney was situated in its typical position and measured 86 х 40 mm, with a parenchyma thickness not exceeding 10–12 mm. Calculi up to 12 mm were detected in the renal calyces. The renal collecting system of the left kidney was not dilated. There was suspicion on the pelvic dystopia of the right kidney, which was complicated by the displacement of the kidney with the hernial sac into the cavity of the right half of the scrotum. Considering the complexity of the given clinical presentation, the patient underwent a multidetector CT scan with contrast enhancement. The results of the CT scan confirmed the location of the right kidney in the right half of the scrotum .\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Multidetector-computed tomography (MDCT) demonstrates the location of the right kidney in the right-sided inguinal hernia. (a) Frontal reconstruction. (b) Sagittal reconstruction.</u>\n\n【15】However, the scrotal localization of the right kidney was a consequence of the nephroptosis rather than dystopia. This was objectively confirmed by the arterial phase of the investigation, which demonstrated that the ostium of the right renal artery was situated in the typical location (at the level L1-L2) and that the renal artery length had a length of over 20 cm .\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Multidetector-computed tomography. Frontal views present a severely elongated right renal artery and stenosis of the left renal artery (a–c).</u>\n\n【17】Only the adipose tissue and the lower half of the right kidney were located within the hernial sac on the right side. The left-sided hernia contained loops of the small intestine and the omentum. The collecting system of the right kidney was dilated due to ureteral angulation. CT images demonstrated the small left kidney with significant stenosis of the left renal artery. Calyceal renal stones were also found in the left kidney without signs of obstruction.\n\n【18】The CT scan also revealed an enlarged prostate measuring 90 × 65 × 60 mm with an intravesical component, as well as bladder stones .\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 MDCT. Axial (a) and sagittal (b) views of an enlarged prostate gland and the right kidney located in the right half of the scrotum.</u>\n\n【20】Obstruction of the right kidney due to ureteral strangulation in the hernia gate and stenosis of the left renal artery with the left kidney atrophy were the causes of oligoanuria in this patient. Considering the signs of acute right-sided pyelonephritis, signs of ureteral obstruction, serious overall condition, and the absence of intestinal loops in the hernial sac, it was decided to perform a minimally invasive treatment—percutaneous nephrostomy through the upper part of the right half of the scrotum . The nephrostomy was performed by the highest category urologist with over 20-year experience, without any difficulties or complications.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Percutaneous nephrostomy via the right inguinal area.</u>\n\n【22】Over the next week, antibacterial and detoxication therapy showed favorable results. Diuresis through the percutaneous nephrostomy was approximately 2000–2500 ml/day and through the urethral catheter was approximately 200–300 ml/day. Given the patient’s age, serious overall condition, and high risk of fatal complications during any surgical treatment, as well as the patient’s will, it was decided to provide conservative treatment only. The patient was discharged with significant improvement. Over the next two years, he underwent periodic replacements of nephrostomy and urethral catheters performed by the same specialist as initial treatment.\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】Inguinal hernia is one of the most common surgical diseases, which occur in about 3-4% of the people in the general population. This condition can lead to intestinal obstruction since the hernial sac typically contains the small intestine or omentum. While urological organs are less commonly involved in inguinal hernias, the bladder and ureter may also be affected. According to Oruç et al. 11.2% of hernias are associated with urological tumors and 23.5% are accompanied by complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Currently, only a few cases of “extreme nephroptosis” (the displacement of the kidney into the cavity of the inguinal hernia) have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>.\n\n【25】We analyzed data from seven patients reported in the literature, including one of our own patients . In all the cases, the patients were males. Their ages ranged from 62 to 93 years and averaged 79.8 ± 11.2 years. In six out of the seven observations, right-sided hernias occurred. Symptoms of a strangulated inguinal-scrotal hernia were found in only two patients. Interestingly, in most cases, no intestinal loops were found in the hernia cavity. The most common clinical sign was ureteral obstruction due to its strangulation in the hernia, which occurred in six patients. Examination revealed severe renal failure in three patients as follows: in two cases, it was associated with the obstruction of the ureter in a hernia and with a wrinkled contralateral kidney, while in one case, it was associated with the obstruction of the ureter in a hernia and with crush syndrome after a traumatic brain injury. Urolithiasis was present in two patients, while stenosis of the renal artery of the contralateral kidney was present in one.\n\n【26】Table 1 Clinical features of patients with “extreme nephroptosis.”\n\n【27】It is worth noting that the treatment of patients with “extreme nephroptosis” in most cases is a difficult task. This is due to the massive size of the hernia, the poor general status, and the age of the patients. All seven men in our study had large or “giant” irreducible hernias, including the monstrous hernia described by Wendler et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition, all patients had hernias for an extended period. Six out of seven patients had a poor general condition upon admission to the hospital.\n\n【28】Surgical hernia repair has been described in two reports, with nephropexy being performed in only one of those cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. In our patient, due to his advanced age and poor general condition, we opted for percutaneous nephrostomy. The nephrostomy tube was inserted into the scrotum through the right inguinal region under ultrasonographic guidance. Such treatment approach was chosen based on the CT image data, indicating the absence of intestinal loops in the hernial sac and was not associated with any complications.\n\n【29】In six patients, CT images showed the kidney displacement into the scrotum from an orthotopic position. This conclusion was based on the significant elongation of the renal vessels. In our patient, the length of the right renal artery was over 20 cm. At the same time, there were no signs of wrinkling of this kidney. In the report by Osmani et al. the displacement of a pelvic dystopic kidney into the hernial sac was demonstrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Most probably, the mechanism behind the “extreme displacement” of the kidney into the inguinal hernia cavity is associated with the presence of wide hernial orifices and weak fixation of the perinephric fatty tissue to the sheets of Gerota’s fascia.\n\n【31】Long-standing hernias can lead to highly unusual life-threatening complications. It is advisable to provide patients with education materials regarding possible hernia complications. The similar cases should be managed in specialized centers since they require regular follow-ups and repeated procedures by qualified surgeons.\n\n【32】#### 4\\. Informed Consent\n\n【33】The patient provided a written consent for the medical intervention, as well as his permission for publication of all the clinical details and any materials associated with this procedure.\n\n【34】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【35】“Extreme nephroptosis” or the displacement of the kidney from its normal orthotopic position into the inguinal-scrotal hernia cavity is a very uncommon phenomenon that requires further investigation. This disease has, thus far, been observed exclusively in elderly men with long-standing and large inguinal hernias. The most frequent complications in these patients include ureteral strangulation in the area of the hernial gate and renal failure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) remains the initial diagnostic imaging modality. However, detection rates have been as low as 12%. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) improves diagnostic accuracy though it may not detect commonly associated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging provides a noninvasive, highly sensitive and specific imaging modality of SV-ASD. We describe a case of an adult male with exercise-induced, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia who presented with palpitations and dyspnea. Despite nondiagnostic imaging results on TTE, CMR proved to be instrumental in visualizing a hemodynamically significant SV-ASD with PAPVR that ultimately led to surgical correction.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Sinus venosus atrial septal defects (SV-ASD) involve the insertion of the superior or inferior vena cava and account for 2–12% of all atrial communication abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The defect does not involve the embryologic atrial septum but most often affects the superior vena cava at the junction of the right atrium. There are at least one or more anomalous connections involving the right pulmonary vein(s) to the superior or inferior vena cava or the right atrium. Most patients present with exertional dyspnea, though the age at onset of symptoms is highly variable. Other clinical manifestations include paradoxical embolism and recurrent pulmonary infections. Arrhythmias have been observed when the degree of shunt has resulted in significant atrial dilation, typically during the fourth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation often requires more advanced imaging to include transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, and/or electrocardiography- (ECG-) gated cardiac computed tomography (CT).\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 59-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented with a two-month history of exertional palpitations, lightheadedness, and dyspnea. His resting ECG was normal. On exercise stress testing, the patient developed supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a ventricular rate of 292 beats per minute with reproducible symptoms . Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated mild right atrial and ventricular enlargement and a dilated pulmonary artery (PA) with an estimated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure of 45–50 mmHg. Right ventricular systolic function was normal. An agitated saline microbubble study was positive with near simultaneous observation of microbubbles in the right and left atria consistent with intracardiac shunting. There was no additional evidence of an atrial septal defect to include color-flow Doppler interrogation. Shunt calculation by TTE measurements revealed a pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs) of 1.7.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Electrocardiogram obtained during exercise stress test demonstrating sinus tachycardia at approximately 155 beats per minute (bpm).

Left heart catheterization with selective coronary angiography demonstrated no evidence of coronary artery disease. The cardiac catheterizations were performed prior to any suspicion for intracardiac shunting, immediately following the diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia. A full oxygen saturation evaluation on RHC was not performed for unclear reasons. Transesophageal echocardiography was also not performed at the request of the patient; CMR imaging was offered as an alternative imaging option.\n\n【8】On CMR, a large SV-ASD was observed with severe right atrial and ventricular enlargement . The PA was dilated at 4.2 cm. Additionally, a partial right-upper lobe anomalous pulmonary venous connection was identified  with hemodynamically significant shunting (Qp/Qs 2.2).\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Sagittal 3-dimensional steady state free precession (SSFP) magnetic resonance image demonstrating a large sinus venosus defect (circle).

The preferred treatment of such hemorrhages is surgical clipping through craniotomy. There are few reports about endovascular coil embolization in such cases. We report such a case treated by endovascular embolization. A 35-year-old man, who had experienced 2 episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), was found to have a ruptured ID of the PCo-A by head computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). We performed stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization through a combined anterior and posterior circulation approach. Postembolization angiography showed absence of contrast filling of the ID of the PCo-A and nonleakage of the contrast agent. The patient recovered well with no complications. SAH recurrence was not recorded during the 1-year followup. The postoperative angiographic result was good. To our knowledge, this is the first case of hemorrhage due to ruptured ID of the PCo-A that was treated by such a technique.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】ID of the PCo-A refers to funnel-shaped widenings with a diameter less than 3 mm at the junction of the posterior communicating artery and the internal carotid artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. ID of the PCo-A was regarded as normal anatomical variants with a low risk of rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, with increasing reports of ruptured ID of the PCo-A, bleeding is also found to occur in cases of ID of the PCo-A. Aggressive treatment (i.e. surgical clipping) is preferred for most patients presenting with hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–6\\]</u>, but little is known about the endovascular treatment of this condition. We report a case of ruptured ID of the PCo-A successfully treated by endovascular embolization.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 35-year-old man was admitted with sudden onset of headache and vomiting. At admission, he was in relatively good condition. Hunt-Hess scale was grade III, and the GCS score was 13 at presentation. A CT scan of the head revealed SAH mainly in the right suprasellar cistern with a Fisher grade of 3 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Dehydration therapy was performed immediately. Nine hours after the onset of symptoms, the patient lapsed into a coma; Hunt-Hess grade progressed to IV, and the GCS score deteriorated to 8. A repeated head CT examination revealed rebleeding, acute hydrocephalus, hematocele at bilateral posterior horns of the lateral ventricle, and a Fisher grade of 4 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. A CTA was performed together with a CT and revealed a conical expansion of the infundibulum at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery with a diameter of less than 3 mm. The thin right posterior communicating artery arose from the apex of the infundibulum. In addition, no aneurysm was noted in angiography (arrow in Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). DSA and 3-D reconstruction were then performed, and these findings were similar to those seen in the CTA (arrow in Figures 1(e), 1(f), and 1(g)). After these imagings, conservative treatments including dehydration therapy were administered to allow the reabsorption of SAH. Nimodipine was given for antivasospasm treatment. In the meantime, lumbar drainage was performed to drain bloody cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Diagnosis of ruptured ID of the PCo-A. (a, b) Two SAH images detected at an interval of 9 hours show that the bleeding points in both episodes of hemorrhage were centered around the origin of the right posterior communicating artery and that the suprasellar cistern, sylvian cistern, ambient cistern, and tentorial margin were involved. Blood entry into the ventricles and the presence of ventriculomegaly were seen in (b). (c, d) Head CTA showed that a funnel-shaped expansion with a diameter of less than 3 mm occurred at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery and was in conjunction with the thin right posterior communicating artery at its apex (arrow).

(h) Reexamination by head CT after 20 days of conservative treatment demonstrated that SAH was absorbed and the size of ventricles was normal. (i) The second DSA examination after 20 days of conservative treatment revealed that the funnel-shaped expansion still existed at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery and was in conjunction with the thin posterior communicating artery at its apex, similar to the results obtained by CTA and the first DSA (arrow). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】After 20 days of conservative treatment, the patient’s condition got better, and he could follow simple commands. A repeated head CT showed that SAH was reabsorbed, and the size of the ventricles became normal 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(h))</u>. DSA was performed again and yielded the same result as the previous one (arrow in Figure 1(i)). Thus, ruptured ID of the PCo-A was diagnosed, and we planned to perform coil embolization. Because of the wide neck of the ID, stent-assisted occlusion was required. As a result, clopidogrel and aspirin were administrated orally for one week.\n\n【8】At day 27 after the bleed, endovascular coil embolization was performed under general anesthesia. The right femoral artery was punctured using the Seldinger technique to introduce a vascular sheath. Heparin was administered. Vertebral angiography with carotid compression was performed before vascular embolization so as to observe the blood supply to the posterior circulation of the ID of the PCo-A. The result showed that blood flow reversed into the internal carotid artery through the posterior communicating artery 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>. Subsequently, endovascular embolization of the ID of the PCo-A was conducted. After a suitable working angle was selected, a Neuroform3 stent (4.0 mm  ×  20 mm) was successfully released using an Echelon-14 microcatheter and Transend-300 microguidewire to completely cover the neck of the ID of the PCo-A. Subsequently, an Echelon-10 microcatheter was delivered into the ID of the PCo-A using Transend-300 microguidewire through the stent mesh. After angiography, a HydroCoil 10 coil (2 mm  ×  2 cm, MicroVention, Aliso Viejo, Calif) was released into the ID of the PCo-A. However, the coil was not detached due to the unfavorable location 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. The left femoral artery was punctured for introduction of a vascular sheath, and then an Echelon-10 microcatheter was placed into the PCo-A ID using a Transend-300 microguidewire via the posterior communicating artery 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u>. Four HydroCoil 10 coils were sequentially released (2 mm  ×  2 cm, 2 mm  ×  2 cm, 2 mm  ×1 cm, 2 mm  ×  1 cm) to fill the ID of the PCo-A 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(e))</u>. No enhancement of the ID of the PCo-A was shown in the angiography of anterior or posterior circulation, and leakage of the contrast agent did not occur 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(f) and 2(g))</u>. The coil placed in the internal carotid artery was detached 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(h))</u>. After catheters and sheaths were removed, the procedure was completed.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Endovascular coil embolization of ruptured ID of the PCo-A.

(a, b) The follow-up DSA did not show the recurrence of ID of the PCo-A. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】ID of the PCo-A is not a rare clinical entity. However, the prevalence of it on carotid angiography ranges from 5% to 17% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u> or even higher, as shown in other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. The natural history of ID of the PCo-A remains unclear; it is generally recognized as an anatomical variant resulting from incomplete retrogression of vessels during embryonic development. ID of the PCo-A usually does not rupture or bleed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 8\\]</u>. However, a number of studies have reported fatal SAH caused by ID of the PCo-A rupture or its progression to aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Hemorrhage due to the rupture of the ID of the PCo-A is surgically treated (i.e. surgical clipping) to prevent disastrous consequences due to rebleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 8, 12–20\\]</u>. In most IDs of the PCo-A, PCo-A is not well developed and has few perforating branches; so, the origin of the ID of the PCo-A is clipped in an orientation parallel to the internal carotid artery to prevent rebleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–18\\]</u>.\n\n【14】However, in our patient, although the right PCo-A was underdeveloped, neurosurgical clipping treatment was not selected, and stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization was performed using a combined approach of anterior and posterior circulation. This approach was considered because we found that the ID of the PCo-A had a wide junction with the internal carotid artery, making full clipping quite difficult similar to wide-necked aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Moreover, a previous study has shown that the bleeding points in the ruptured ID of the PCo-A were mostly located at the distal side of the ID, close to the internal carotid artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Under such circumstances, blood could still flow into the inside of the ID along the PCo-A even when the origin of the ID is clipped.\n\n【15】In the current study, enhancement of the PCo-A was not revealed in the DSA of posterior circulation, but it appeared in the angiography of the compressed internal carotid artery. Blood flowed reversely into the internal carotid artery 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u> indicating the possibility of rebleeding if the neck of the ID was clipped and the ruptured bleeding point was left untreated. However, clipping the bleeding points of the ID of the PCo-A might result in new bleeding sites near the previous ones, due to the continuous impact of blood flow; there is also the probability that the ID of the PCo-A will progress to an aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 23\\]</u>. Therefore, at least 2 aneurysm clips are needed for isolation of the ID of the PCo-A in order to prevent rebleeding. It is difficult to place two aneurysm clips because of the narrow operating space around the posterior communicating artery. On the contrary, stent-assisted coil embolization by means of endovascular approach is relatively safe in comparison to neurosurgical clipping. Therefore, we preferred to perform endovascular treatment.\n\n【16】Although the patient experienced two SAH episodes in this study, the CTA on admission and first the DSA did not reveal the aneurysm but a conical expansion of the infundibulum at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery. At that time, ruptured ID of PCo-A could not be confirmed because profound SAH might have resulted in vasospasms that hide a very small aneurysm. In addition, the condition of the patient was critical. If we had attempted to treat the expansion of the infundibulum, disastrous result might have occurred or the aneurysm might have been missed. The better alternative was to wait until the blood was reabsorbed. After 20 days of conservative treatment, the repeated CT revealed reabsorption of blood along with an improvement in the condition of the patient. The DSA was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of ruptured ID of the PCo-A. Endovascular treatment lead to a good outcome. The follow-up DSA did not show the recurrence of ID of the PCo-A.\n\n【17】To date, no report on endovascular intervention treatment for ruptured ID of the PCo-A is available. We made an attempt to provide a new strategy for its treatment. While considering endovascular embolization for eligible patients with ID of the PCo-A, the following two factors need to be taken into account. First, the ipsilateral internal carotid artery needs to be compressed when conducting vertebral angiography so as to fully assess the hemodynamic status of the ID of the PCo-A. Therefore, rupture due to incomplete filling and blood supply from the posterior circulation can be prevented. Second, stent-assisted embolization is required because of the wide neck of the ID of the PCo-A. When full blocking is not possible through the internal carotid artery of the anterior circulation alone, it is preferable to carry out the blocking through the combined approach of anterior and posterior (via the posterior communicating artery) circulation.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】Stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization through a combined approach of anterior and posterior circulation provides a new strategy for treatment of hemorrhage due to rupture of the ID of the PCo-A.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Inflammatory pseudo-tumors (IPT) of the liver are rare and difficult to diagnose, because mimicking malignant tumors. Aim. We report a case of IPT of the liver wich diagnosis was made on clinical, radiological and evolutif features. Observation. A 15-year-old man had a 4-month history of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant with fever and cought. Two successives ultrasonographies revealed a hypoechoic lesion occuping the segment VIII with 8 cm of diametre. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory investigation showed normal blood counts, liver function test and tumoral markers. Another ultrasonography was interpretated as normal. Tomodensitometry had showon a 3-cm lesion wich enhanced later after contrast injection. A second tomodensitometry done one mounth later described a 2-cm sub capsular heaptic lesion. Discussion. On routine activiy, pre operative diagnosis of IPT of the liver is difficut, and rarely made with certitude because mimicking a malignant tumor. In our cae report here, the analysis of previous history, of clinical, biological and radiological presentation, had permittes us to pose the diagnosis of PTI of the liver and this despite the absence of histological confirmation by percutaneous biopsy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver (IPLs) are fibroblastic proliferations more or less fibrous, infiltrated by polymorphic inflammatory cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. They are not so rare since the literature showed many edifying examples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Their better characterization with the morphological examinations had permitted us these last years to make the diagnosis more often. This stresses, especially in face of the great progress realized in the field of surgery of malignant hepatic tumors, the great importance to pay attention to IPLs which the evolution is benign and does not necessitate any intervention. Thus, it is crucial to put on the right diagnosis and prevent unnecessary hepatic resection.\n\n【4】Hereby we present another case of spontaneous regression of IPL in which we recall diagnostic and evolutionary modalities.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】We report a case of 15-year-old young man otherwise healthy who complains for 4 months of right upper quadrant pain accompanied with high fever and productive cough. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of the right diaphragmatic dome . Abdominal ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic and heterogeneous mass, measuring 8 cm in diameter, localized in the hepatic dome . At his admission, the physical examination was normal. White blood cell count was 7500; c-reactive protein was normal too. Hepatic function test and tumor markers were within normal range (AFP and CEA).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Elevation of the right diaphragmatic dome. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Hypoechoic and heterogeneous mass, localized in the hepatic dome. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】Abdominal tomography revealed a subcapsular lesion occupying segments VII and VIII and measuring 4 cm in diameter spontaneously hypodense and having slight peripheral enhancement at delayed stage .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | CT scan showing subcapsular lesion occupying segment VII and VIII and measuring 4 cm in diameter spontaneously low attenuated and having slight peripheral enhancement at delayed stage. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】A second tomography done one month later described the same lesion with the same characteristics but with a dramatic decrease in size which is evaluated to be 2 cm in diameter . This spontaneous regression in size associated with radiological characteristics of a partially fibrous lesion permitted us to make the diagnosis of IPL and to abstain from any therapeutics. The patient is doing well and another radiologic control is foreseen in 6 months.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | CT scan showing a decrease in tumor size which is evaluated to be 2 cm. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】The pathogenesis of IPL remains uncertain. It would be in relation with an exaggerated or inadequate inflammatory response of an existing microorganism in the portal circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Abbey-Toby et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> distinguished two clinicopathological entities which have different clinical and radiological forms: the first one consists of both fusiform cells and inflammatory polymorphic cells associated with adjacent fibrous portal endophlebitis and accompanied besides that by an inflammatory syndrome. In return, the second form which is encapsulated has abundant central necrosis and it is always clinically asymptomatic. It would be the result of a chronic inflammatory processes and this corresponds to the healing version of IPL. This evolutionary form explains the diminution in size lesion observed in our patient. This evoked several reported cases in literature where regression of IPL either spontaneously or by an anti-inflammatory or antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5–11\\]</u> is reported.\n\n【15】Since the IPL are known as benign lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and that its natural history progresses towards regression, it is essential to make the exact diagnosis and to not consider it as a malignant tumor that may lead to unnecessary resection. However, diagnosis is not easy due to the absence of specific radiological signs and to the variability of the radiologic aspects which are related to the evolutionary stage of IPL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In the current case, the main characteristic that helped to make the diagnosis is the regression of the tumor size on two successive CT scan. The diagnosis should be discussed also when a liver mass has the characteristics of a lesion with a fibrous component with late contrast or necrotic. Indeed, the IPL is hypoechoic on US and has well-defined borders. On noncontrast CT study, the lesion reveals low attenuation and a moderate enhancement following contrast administration in the periphery and in late stage. On MRI, IPL is frequently hypointense in T1-weighted images, hyperintense in T2-weighted images, and of heterogenic uptake after gadolinium injection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However, these features are variable and the diagnosis is often evoked in the absence of signs for common benign and malignant liver lesions .\n\n【16】Table 1 Imaging features of common hepatic lesions.\n\n【17】In terms of radiologic analysis, the diagnosis of IPL should be evoked every time that we are faced with partially fibrous hepatic mass with late uptake of contrast material and in absence of signs for specific hepatic tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In this stage the diagnosis may be put on by the presence of regression in size of the hepatic mass as it was the case for our patient and two other cases reported by Yamaguchi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In total, the combination of radiologic suggestive signs on CT scan with a regression of tumor size on successive morphological examinations eliminates all differential diagnoses and can retain the diagnosis of IPT. Otherwise, in the absence of one of these criteria, percutaneous needle biopsy of the tumor is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The pathologic diagnosis is based on the presence of densely hyalinized collagenous tissue with an inflammatory infiltrate of predominantly plasma cells. Some portions of the stroma show fibroblasts in interlacing laminated or whorled patterns. Typical changes are seen in large and medium-sized veins with inflammation involving the vessel walls and filling of the lumen with connective tissue containing capillaries and inflammatory cells. Many veins show complete obliteration of the lumen. In contrast, arteries show no major alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【18】It has not been established whether steroid administration accelerates resolution of IPL but it may reduce the systemic symptoms of the inflammatory syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Most often the tumor regresses spontaneously and only a radiological monitoring should be introduced until complete healing of the lesion.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】The IPL are benign lesions which show spontaneous regression. The preoperative diagnosis is difficult since the radiological presentation is taken for a malignant tumor. Attention should always be paid in case of partially fibrous hepatic mass with late contrast uptake and without any specific sign in order to avoid any unnecessary surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The history of the patient was unremarkable, and she did not mention any medical or surgical illness. Laboratory examinations revealed hemoglobin (Hb): 13.6 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC): 7,100/mm³, serum albumin: 3.7 g/dL (N: 3.8–5.1 g/dL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 24 U/L (N: 0–31 U/L), alkaline phosphatase: 202 U/L (N: 0–240 U/L), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT): 24 U/L (N: 0–38 U/L).

Discussion\n\n【13】Biliary microhamartomas are tumor-like lesions of the liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Histologically, they are clusters of proliferated bile ducts lined by single layer of cuboidal cells embedded in fibrocollagenous tissue, and their size varies between 0.1 and 10 mm, but lesions measuring 1.5 cm in diameter can be demonstrated, as it was in the present case. Biliary microhamartomas do not generally give any symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5\\]</u>. Adult polycystic liver disease (APLD) was reported to associate with biliary microhamartomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. With any imaging modality mentioned above, we could not be able to demonstrate larger and more numerous liver cysts which we are used to see in enlarged, diffusely cystic livers with APLD. But we decided to include the patient in a follow-up program to monitor the liver lesions.\n\n【14】US, CT, MRI, MRCP, and hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) were used as imaging modalities in the diagnosis of biliary microhamartomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. On US, the lesions can be seen as multiple, small, hypoechoic, or anechoic cystic lesions involving all segments. However, besides small cystic lesions, biliary microhamartomas can also be seen as hyperechogenic areas or lesions, and comet-tail artifacts may be seen posterior to the lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. In the present case, US did not reveal any prominent lesion, suggesting that US may not be a suitable modality to show biliary microhamartomas. On CT, biliary microhamartomas are observed as multiple, round or irregular, small, hypodense lesions up to scattered throughout the liver on precontrast images. Luo et al. reported that on CT, lesions showed no enhancement, but increased in number by approximately 80–150% after administration of intravenous contrast medium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. On MRI, lesions appear hypointense and hyperintense on precontrast T1-weighted images and T2-weighted images, respectively. They show no communication with the biliary tree and demonstrate irregular delineation with no or slight rim enhancement following gadolinium administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In differential diagnosis, it is necessary to consider peribiliary cysts, simple hepatic cysts, autosomal dominant polycystic disease, metastatic liver disease, microabscesses, dilated biliary ducts, and Caroli’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8, 9, 12\\]</u>. Peribiliary cysts are multiple, small, cystic dilatations of the intrahepatic extramural peribiliary glands, but they are located exclusively in the hepatic hilum and along the larger portal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, which is different from the scattered distribution of biliary microhamartomas. Simple hepatic cysts are not as numerous and uniformly small as biliary microhamartomas. In autosomal dominant polycystic disease, cysts are usually larger and more numerous. Liver metastases are more variable in size, density, or signal intensity on CT and MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. MRI can aid in the differentiation of liver cysts (such as biliary microhamartomas) and liver metastases by identifying the hyperintense signal from liver cysts on heavily T2-weighted sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Differentiation of biliary microhamartomas from microabscesses can generally be made clinically. Differentiation from dilated biliary ducts and Caroli’s disease can be made by looking at their association with biliary ducts using MRCP. Nuclear imaging can also be performed in differentiation of biliary microhamartomas from Caroli’s disease. In Caroli’s disease, HBS shows a particular pattern of cystic dilatation with accumulation of tracer in the intrahepatic ducts of the biliary tree 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Zheng et al. performed HBS in a case of biliary microhamartoma by using 99mTC-N-pyridoxy 1-5-methyl tryptophan (99mTC-PMT). HBS revealed that biliary system excreting function of radioisotope was normal and demonstrated normal appearances of biliary system without pooling areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> which helped to differentiate the entity from Caroli’s disease. In our case, since MRCP depicted bile ducts with their normal width, shape, and contours, we did not need to perform further imaging with HBS. We recommend the clinicians to use MRCP as an ultimate imaging modality to differentiate biliary microhamartomas from Caroli’s disease as we did in our case, but whenever they experience difficulty in diagnosis, we suggest that they can use HBS as a confirmative tool to solve the problem.\n\n【16】In conclusion, CT, MRI, and MRCP were useful in differentiating biliary microhamartomas from other cystic liver diseases and metastatic liver lesions in our case. Though biliary microhamartomas rarely show malignant transformation, this probability make radiological imaging of biliary microhamartomas necessary for early diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Although generally well tolerated, adverse effects such as gastroesophageal reflux and oesophageal and peptic ulceration may occur. Oral mucositis and ulceration are lesser-known side effects. Proper counselling and rigorous adherence to the administration instructions are crucial. We describe a case of bisphosphonate-induced severe oral mucosal ulceration in an elderly woman that was caused by incorrect instructions and/or incorrect understanding of instructions for oral alendronate intake.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Oral bisphosphonates such as alendronate and risedronate are amongst the most commonly prescribed medications for the treatment of osteoporosis in men over the age of 50 and in postmenopausal women. They have been in clinical use for this purpose since 1970 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Dental and orthopaedic surgeons as well as physicians involved in the care of osteoporosis are well aware of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), a rare but calamitous problem that has been associated with oral and intravenous bisphosphonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Patients are also usually counselled on gastric and oesophageal side effects of the oral bisphosphonates and are instructed to stay upright for at least 30–45 minutes after taking these oral agents to avoid esophagatis. Less well-known side effects are the oral mucosal lesions that may be associated with the use of these agents of which very few reports in the scientific literature databases exist. Most of the ones reported were in situations where the patients could not follow the instructions given for proper intake of the medication due to associated mental and or physical comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. We describe a case of severe oral mucosal ulceration in a patient with no such comorbidities which is presumed secondary to inadequate instructions about proper intake of the medication. The mucositis had a clear temporal association with intake of oral alendronate tablets. Written permission was obtained from the patient for taking anonymized photographs of her. Permission was also obtained to write and submit a case report to a scientific journal.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 79-year-old Chinese female accompanied by her daughter was seen at the complicated metabolic bone disorders clinic of our hospital for a second opinion on the management of her severe osteoporosis. She stated that she had been started on oral alendronate about two weeks ago, but had developed an “allergy” to it and therefore wanted an alternative medication. She had a history of left ankle fracture in 2017. Axial dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan of the hip and spine showed a T score of −3.8 at the left femoral neck and −3.5 at the lumbar spine. She had no other medical problems other than dyslipidemia for which she had been taking lovastatin for several years. She had been started on generic alendronate tablet 70 mg/week by the physician. She took the first dose on 12 September. On 13 September, she started to experience gum pain with food intake and noticed a small oral ulcer of approximately 1 cm on the hard palate. She dismissed it without giving it much importance. By the 19<sup>th</sup> of September, when she took the 2<sup>nd</sup> dose of alendronate, the ulcer had increased in size . By now, the oral pain had increased, and she found it difficult to take any food that was not soft or sweet. The ulcer had increased in size and had extended to the upper gum . She went back to the general practitioner on 21 September who diagnosed her with oral thrush and prescribed an antifungal oral gel. The ulceration by then had progressed rapidly to involve the tongue and the inside of the left side of the lip, and she could only tolerate a liquid diet. She had a fever with temperatures up to 38.5 degree Celsius that lasted for about 8 hours that subsided with oral acetaminophen tablets. She had no previous history of oral ulcers or gastric problems. No skin lesions were present. Other mucosal surfaces such as the eyes and genitalia were not affected.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Appearance of the oral cavity on the 19<sup>th</sup> of September prior to the second dose of alendronate. Mucosal ulceration with some sloughing noted on the hard palate.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Appearance of the oral cavity on the 21<sup>st</sup> of September with extension of oral ulcer to the upper gum and sloughing.</u>\n\n【8】In view of the accelerated spread of the oral ulceration, the family decided to consult a dentist who referred the patient urgently to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of September . The surgeon diagnosed her to have an “allergic” reaction secondary to alendronate and asked her to no longer take alendronate. She was prescribed oral prednisolone, antiseptic mouth rinse, and antiseptic gel with some improvement of the oral ulceration and pain. She attended the metabolic bone disorders clinic on the 25<sup>th</sup> of September. On examination in our clinic, she was found to be a well-nourished elderly lady with no evidence of systemic malaise. She complained of some pain on opening her mouth. Examination of the mouth revealed a well delineated 3 × 4 cm sloughy erosion with irregular margin affecting the hard palate and surface of the tongue with erosions at the angles of the mouth . On palpation, induration was felt along the margins. On further questioning, the patient’s daughter stated that what she had understood of the instructions given to her by the pharmacist who dispensed the medicine was specifically that the medicine should be put in the mouth to be dissolved by saliva, to sit upright for 45 minutes and then to drink water. It was not clear to us if the instructions given had been misunderstood or if incorrect instructions had been given. Given the temporal association of exposure and our knowledge of potential chemically induced mucosal erosions with bisphosphonates, we made a diagnosis of alendronate-induced mucosal ulceration most likely caused by direct prolonged contact of the oral mucosa with the chemical agent. She reported to us 2 weeks later that she had fully recovered. A photograph taken at 1-month postepisode showed normal, edentulous oral cavity . This further confirmed our diagnosis.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Appearance of oral cavity on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of September (10 days after the first dose of alendronate) with extensive involvement of the oral mucosa and angles of the mouth.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Appearance of the oral ulcer on the 25<sup>th</sup> of September upon consultation at the complicated metabolic bone disorders clinic. 3 × 4 cm sloughy erosion with irregular margin on the surface of the tongue with erosions at the angles of the mouth.</u>\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Appearance of oral cavity one month after discontinuing alendronate.</u>\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Oral bisphosphonates have been reported to cause oesophageal and gastric ulceration. However, bisphosphonate-induced oral mucositis and mucosal ulceration are uncommon, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. These most often have been due to inability to take the medication correctly due to associated mental and or physical comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. The proposed mechanisms of mucositis and mucosal ulceration with bisphosphonates include the cytotoxic effect of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates on the epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> as well as the direct irritant effect of the drug on the mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The lesions need to be differentiated from other causes of erosive ulceration including apthous ulcers and that due to trauma and infection. The most common cause of traumatic ulceration is due to ill-fitting dentures and sharp-edged crowns. Such ulcers usually do not demonstrate induration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient was edentulous and had her dentures for a long time prior and had not reported any problems with them before. Ulcers due to infections, for example, viral infections, generally occur as multiple small ulcerations. They present initially as fluid-filled vesicles, which then break down to form small ulcers with irregular margins. These may subsequently coalesce to form large irregular ulcers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Apthous ulcers are usually small and round lesions covered often with a pseudomembrane and surrounded by erythematous haloes. The cause remains unknown though viral infections, B12 deficiency, etc. have been postulated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Oral lichen planus usually presents as bilateral lesions on the buccal mucosa with a symmetrical lace-like pattern. Ulceration rarely may be seen within the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune bullous disease, is characterized by bullae formation that subsequently develops into painful, shallow, irregular ulcers. Nikolsky sign—the pathognomonic sign of pemphigus—is usually present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Our patient did not have any evidence to suggest that this was pemphigus vulgaris. She was also not on any other medications that cause oral ulcerations such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), beta blockers, immunosuppressants, anti-inflammatory, or immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Withdrawal of medication and symptomatic management are the mainstay of treatment for bisphosphonate-associated oral mucositis. It is imperative that healthcare providers provide detailed and proper counselling on the proper administration technique of oral bisphosphonates. Alendronate and other similar oral bisphosphonates should be taken first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a full glass of plain water at least 30 mins to 1 hour before other food, drinks, and medications. Alendronate should be swallowed whole without chewing, and patients should remain in the upright position for at least 30 mins. Healthcare providers should avoid usage of alendronate in patients who cannot sit upright for 30 mins and in those with a history of dysphagia, reflux, and esophagitis. Reintroduction of alendronate is possible after the resolution of the ulcer and strict adherence to proper administration procedure.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【16】Although oral bisphosphonates are generally well tolerated, oral mucosal ulcerations and mucositis can develop due to improper administration such as sucking, chewing, or holding it in the oral cavity for prolonged periods of time. Proper counselling and rigorous adherence to the administration instructions are key to prevent this complication. Osteoporosis is more common in elderly individuals, and they are more likely to be started on these medications. They often may not understand instructions, and especially in such patients, instructions should be reinforced, and patients should be encouraged to recite back to the physician or the dispensing pharmacist the instructions to make sure that they have understood them. No detail is too small when counselling patients on the proper administration of these potent medications, and it is the responsibility of the healthcare provider to ensure that the patient has understood the instructions. It is also important for healthcare providers to recognise this side effect to allow for prompt withdrawal of the medication upon its identification.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This diagnosis is difficult due to challenging radiographic interpretations of multiple imaging modalities. We present a case of a 60-year-old male, who presented to his pulmonologist and underwent a CT chest with IV contrast that initially suggested primary lung carcinoma. CT angiogram showed significant vascular filling defects suspicious of an intravascular mass, rather than vascular invasion by lung lesions. The PET/CT scans further suggested a malignant process, but indistinguishable between an extravascular or intravascular etiology. Taking these results together, they suggested an intravascular malignancy, prompting a tissue biopsy, which ultimately led to a diagnosis of PAIS with metastases. Establishing a definitive diagnosis is essential as treatment and prognosis are different for sarcoma compared to carcinoma. There is no standard treatment to date, and management often includes a multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. PAIS is a rare entity that cannot be diagnosed clinically and needs a multimodality approach for its diagnosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma (PAIS) is a rare tumor with poor prognosis that mimics conditions such as pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm, extravascular tumor invasion, and thromboembolism. Often, there are diagnostic delays as symptoms are nonspecific and diagnostic investigations can be time consuming. PAIS is a rare entity, and our case demonstrates the extensive clinical and radiographical investigations necessary to establish this diagnosis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 60-year-old African American male presented to his pulmonologist with a one-month history of persistent productive cough. He has been producing clear mucous, without any blood. His cough has been progressively worse throughout the past month. His cough was worse during the day and exacerbated by cold beverages and cold air. The patient denied other symptoms including shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, hemoptysis, subjective fevers, chills, or night sweats. He denied typical symptoms for seasonal allergies and gastroesophageal reflux. The patient has a past medical history of sickle cell trait and atrial fibrillation. His past surgical history is notable for a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy resulting in a 150-pound weight loss five years ago. He has a family history of sickle cell disease, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, without any cancer. He also denied any weight loss, changes in appetite, dysphagia, or odynophagia. He denies any history of tobacco use or other recreational drugs but has a previous history of alcohol use. The patient has no occupational exposure to hazardous material and is a bus operator for the past several years. He denied any recent travel. He lives alone and is functional and independent at home without any need for supplemental oxygen. The patient had experienced a similar cough approximately one year prior with associated fevers, otalgia, and chest congestion. At that time, he was treated with a course of antibiotics resulting in complete resolution of his symptoms.\n\n【6】His vital signs on presentation were within normal limits, and he was saturating well above 95% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appeared comfortable and was in no respiratory distress. He was well developed and well nourished. He was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and events. Cardiovascular exam was unremarkable. Pulmonary exam revealed normal respiratory effort and normal breath sounds, with no stridor, wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. The patient also did not exhibit any palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Laboratory testing, including complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, did not reveal any abnormalities. A chest X-ray , in comparison to one year prior, revealed multiple new lung nodules. A chest CT with contrast demonstrated mediastinal adenopathy and multiple, large, round lung nodules with sharp borders predominantly in the right lung (a 3.3 cm nodule in the medial right upper lobe and two nodules in the right lower lobe, 4.8 cm and 3 cm, respectively) with mass effect on the right pulmonary artery and encasement of the right pulmonary artery, in addition to a left lower lobe nodule (2.2 cm) 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Initial chest X-ray showing multiple new pulmonary nodules.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a) Initial CT of the chest showing large intravascular mass encasing the right main pulmonary artery.

(c) After 3 cycles of palbociclib, the patient had stable disease.</u>\n\n【9】Given the new radiographic findings, he was sent to the hospital for additional workup and was scheduled for CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy. Tumor markers (alpha fetoprotein, B-HCG/LDH, CEA, and CA 19-9) at this time were all within the normal range. To further evaluate the patency of the pulmonary arteries, a chest CT angiogram was performed, which revealed a soft-tissue density mass in the right pulmonary artery with scattered bilateral lung parenchymal lesions concerning for metastatic pulmonary angiosarcoma with known osseous metastatic lesion involving T3 vertebrae. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right lower lung mass was nondiagnostic with some atypical spindle cells in a background of necrosis. Given the concern for spinal cord compression, an MRI of the thoracic spine was performed which revealed enhancing lesions at the T3 posterior elements with epidural involvement and compression, as well as posterior T4 vertebral body. MRI of the cervical spine was without evidence of disease. Ultimately, the patient underwent a T3 laminectomy with a T2 and T4 partial laminectomy and a posterior thoracic spine fusion of T2-T5 with screws, rods, and allograft along with resection of a spinal epidural mass. Pathologic review of the biopsied epidural mass revealed an intimal sarcoma, with epithelioid and pleomorphic features, of high grade involving bone. There were 19 mitoses per 10 high-power field. Focal tumor necrosis was present (<50%). Immunohistochemistry noted rare scattered tumor cells positive for SMA, CMA , and AE , but was negative for S100, CK 7, HMB45, CK19, CK , EMA, CD31, and CD34. GMS and AFB special stains were negative for microorganisms. Additional immunostaining performed showed that the tumor cells were positive for SMA and desmin and negative for STAT-6 and SAT2B. BCL-1 stain revealed nuclear reactivity and few scattered tumor cells. INI-1 was retained. FISH was performed and demonstrated amplification of MDM2. Furthermore, CT abdomen/pelvis was negative for any metastatic disease. The patient was discharged home with pain control and instructions to follow-up outpatient with pulmonology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and neurosurgery.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Follow-Up\n\n【11】The patient completed ten cycles of palliative radiation therapy to the T2-T5 region for a total dose of 3000 cGy. Following completion, he developed pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. He presented to a different hospital and underwent CT chest angiogram and was diagnosed with large right proximal pulmonary embolism and he was started on apixaban. He subsequently reported several episodes of blood-streaked sputum after initiation of anticoagulation. PET/CT was performed showcasing extensive hypermetabolic pulmonary nodules/masses, right much greater than left, and hypermetabolic poorly characterized right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy along with concern for right pulmonary artery invasion. The patient was followed up with medical oncology and was recommended palliative chemotherapy with doxorubicin for his diagnosis of intimal sarcoma. His transthoracic echo demonstrated a normal ejection fracture of 60–65%. His treatment course was complicated by nausea, vomiting, oral mucositis, fatigue, weight loss, and insomnia. Additionally, he developed anemia and neutropenia requiring pegfilgrastim. He later developed fever and was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient completed six cycles of doxorubicin therapy. Posttreatment CT with contrast demonstrated reduction in size of pulmonary metastases and stable-appearing nonocclusive thrombus within the right main pulmonary artery 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Repeat molecular testing revealed CDK4 amplification, and he is currently receiving palbociclib. He was later admitted for shortness of breath and was newly diagnosed with systolic heart failure, likely due to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. He received three cycles of palbociclib. Repeat CT chest with contrast showed stable disease 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>.\n\n【12】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【13】In this case, the patient presented with vague symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and weight loss. Initial imaging modalities, including chest X-ray and CT chest with contrast, were concerning for extravascular tumor compression from primary lung carcinoma. CT angiogram revealed a filling defect suspicious of an intravascular mass, rather than extravascular tumor invasion. PET/CT scan identified pulmonary artery involvement but was unable to differentiate between intravascular or extravascular etiologies. To arrive at the final diagnosis of PAIS with metastases, several different imaging modalities, in addition to a tissue biopsy, were employed.\n\n【14】A multimodal approach, utilizing several imaging modalities to visualize the thorax and vasculatures via CT, PET/CT, and MRI, is the best way to rapidly diagnose PAIS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1,2\\]</u>. The diagnostic challenge lies in the complexity of distinguishing: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> whether the mass is intravascular versus extravascular, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> whether this mass is malignant or benign, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> if the mass is intravascular, whether it is a tumor thrombus, tumor mass, or pseudoaneurysm. Other reported cases suggest that the diagnostic process is often convoluted with difficulties in establishing a diagnosis and subsequent delay in initiating appropriate therapy. To differentiate an intravascular mass from extravascular mass, a CT angiogram would be necessary to directly visualize the pulmonary vasculatures compared to a CT chest with contrast. On CT chest, PAIS is characterized by multiple pulmonary nodules and hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, in comparison to pulmonary thromboembolisms, which often have associated wedge-shaped infarcts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The “wall eclipsing sign,” where the tumor eclipses one or both walls of the main pulmonary artery or its branches, is pathognomonic for PAIS on CT angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In contrast, pulmonary thromboembolism is in the shape of a saddle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. Furthermore, high uptake on PET would suggest a malignancy, whereas low uptake would suggest a nonmalignant etiology such as pulmonary thomboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>. Prior case reports utilized and integrated the findings of all three modalities in order to rapidly diagnose PAIS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>. Cardiac MRI can be utilized to discern neoplastic from thrombotic components by allowing proper visualization of the vasculature and tissue edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In addition, PAIS demonstrates diffusion restriction and heterogeneous enhancement, in comparison to pulmonary thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Tissue biopsy by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration followed by immunohistochemistry remains gold standard for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, the endobronchial biopsy was unrevealing, but a biopsy of the metastatic mass confirmed the diagnosis. Establishing a definitive diagnosis is essential as treatment and prognosis vary drastically for PAIS, pulmonary thromboembolism, and other mimics such as lung carcinoma. It is interesting as this patient was diagnosed with both PAIS and later pulmonary embolism.\n\n【16】There is no standard treatment to date, and management often includes a multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Surgery is considered first-line treatment in order to relieve pulmonary artery obstruction and associated pulmonary hypertension and to palliate symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Surgical intervention is dependent on the location on the extension of the mass and can include pulmonary endarterectomy, pneumonectomy, or a lobectomy. Additionally, surgery is noncurative as it is difficult to achieve clear margins; therefore, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation are utilized, in addition to surgery, to achieve better disease control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. For systemic therapy, anthracyclines are most commonly used along with taxanes, ifosfamide, platinum, and gemcitabine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Despite the above treatment options, prognosis remains poor due to the difficulty in achieving complete disease control. In the metastatic setting, chemotherapy and radiation therapy should be considered prior to any surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In the presented case, given the high-grade nature of PAIS with pulmonary and bone metastasis, palliative chemotherapy with doxorubicin was considered. After six cycles of doxorubicin, the patient had a partial response to his disease; hence, palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) was considered. Among several other alterations, CDK4 amplification was found to be prominent in intimal sarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The role of palbociclib treatment of intimal sarcomas with CDK4 amplification is still under investigation and remains unclear.\n\n【17】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】PAIS is a rare entity often resembling lung carcinoma or pulmonary thromboembolism as a result of nonspecific symptomatology and analogous imaging findings, thereby delaying diagnosis and treatment. There is no standard of treatment for PAIS and its treatment often involves a multidisciplinary approach, with anthracyclines as the main systemic agent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Discussion\n\n【13】We described a case of severe crack cocaine overdose with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and repeated seizures in which an interesting electrocardiographic pattern similar to that found in tricyclic antidepressant poisoning was observed, and these alterations were completely reversed through the acidosis correction.\n\n【14】The classical electrocardiographic abnormalities observed in acute poisoning by tricyclic antidepressant are the widening of QRS; the increase in R wave amplitude in aVR, the QTc interval prolongation, the right-axis deviation of the terminal 40 ms vector of the QRS complex in the frontal plane, and the Brugada-like pattern. Many studies showed that these alterations can help identify patients with high risk of arrhythmia and seizure, mainly the prolongation of the QRS duration >100 ms. This last alteration predicts a higher risk of complications and is used as a formal indication for systemic sodium bicarbonate administration in many medical services 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【15】There are many descriptions of reversal of these electrocardiographic alterations through intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion during tricyclic antidepressant intoxication, and it is recognized as a standard treatment in this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. These electrocardiographic abnormalities are caused mainly by blocking the fast sodium channels; this effect is called “quinidine-like” because it is similar to that caused by the type I antidysrhythmic drugs.\n\n【16】The crack cocaine form is manufactured by processing the cocaine with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate to remove the hydrochloride, and in this way it is heat stable which allows it to be smoked 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our case, the patient used this drug in an unusual manner, because he ingested orally the crack cocaine in a suicide attempt.\n\n【17】Cocaine can block the fast sodium channels and theoretically trigger similar abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this case, the electrocardiographic alterations are probably due to potent sodium channel blockage slowing the cardiac conduction. Although cocaine can block other channels, like the potassium channel, this action is secondary during the clinical presentation, and this drug has a biphasic effect on cardiac repolarization causing a prolongation of the repolarization in a low concentration and a shortening of the repolarization in a high concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In our case, the patient ingested a large amount of cocaine, and we observed QTc interval prolongation; however, only the QRS prolongation caused by the sodium blockage was responsible for this alteration, since the JT interval was normal (280 ms) and remained unchanged after bicarbonate administration.\n\n【18】There are many descriptions of cocaine-related sudden death, but the majority of these patients die before arriving at the hospital, and the mechanisms responsible for these deaths are unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Ventricular arrhythmias as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation induced by the cocaine may be responsible for it; in our case ventricular fibrillation was observed which was promptly reversed by defibrillation. Wang described one case of a 25-year-old man with cardiac arrest resuscitated with epinephrine after the ingestion of crack cocaine who presented electrocardiographic alterations similar to those showed here that improved after sodium bicarbonate infusion; however, in this case arrhythmias and seizure were not described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】These life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias can be precipitated due to myocardial infarction or ischemia induced by the cocaine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>; but in our case, alterations compatible with acute coronary syndrome were not observed, and echocardiography was normal. Therefore, these alterations appear to be a direct local effect of the cocaine on the heart.\n\n【20】Acidosis can increase the toxic effect of the cocaine on the heart in that it increases the sodium channel blocking degree and decreases the conduction between the gap junctions, and, because of this, the acidosis correction is an important goal in the treatment of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Some reports have described the treatment of cocaine-induced arrhythmias with the administration of sodium bicarbonate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Jonsson et al. described an interesting case of cocaine overdose complicated by epileptics status, accelerated idioventricular rhythm associated with metabolic acidosis, and this arrhythmia was abated through the correction of the acidosis with bicarbonate infusion and ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Kerns et al. reported three cases of cocaine overdose with wide complex tachycardia; in one of these cases the rhythm disturbance resolved without direct treatment, but in the other two cases this arrhythmia resolved after intravenous bicarbonate infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【22】In our case, the cocaine-induced electrocardiographic alterations were reversed through the acidosis correction by sodium bicarbonate intravenous infusion and improved ventilation. Tricyclic antidepressant intoxication was actively ruled out in this case through the negative blood dosage.\n\n【23】There are some descriptions of transient Brugada-like pattern after cocaine and tricyclic antidepressant intoxication which is defined by right bundle branch block associated with coved ST-segment elevation in leads V1 and V2. In our case, we observed important alterations in cardiac conduction but not the Brugada-like pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Postresuscitative effects on the heart might have been responsible for some of these alterations, although this electrocardiographic pattern is not commonly observed in other situations of cardiac arrest, and in this case the patient was promptly resuscitated because the cardiac arrest happened during the initial medical evaluation.\n\n【25】The prevalence and prognostic of these electrocardiographic changes during cocaine overdose are unknown, but they could help identify patients at high risk of complications during this clinical setting, and the physicians need to suspect crack cocaine overdose in unconscious patients admitted to the hospital with electrocardiogram pattern compatible with sodium channel blocking.\n\n【26】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【27】The crack cocaine can induce an electrocardiographic pattern similar to that observed in acute poisoning by tricyclic antidepressants which is reversed by sodium bicarbonate infusion. These alterations may help identify patients at high risk of ventricular arrhythmia and seizure during crack cocaine overdose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) is an uncommon disease characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the digestive tract, which occurs due to an uncertain aetiology. Although autoimmune diseases can later present as EGE, it is unusual for EGE to have positive autoimmune antibodies without the presence of an overt autoimmune disease. Case presentation. We report a 38-year-old previously healthy man who presented with abdominal discomfort and loose stools with pleural and peritoneal effusions progressing over several weeks. His investigations revealed severe eosinophilia in peripheral blood and ascitic fluid, and a laparoscopic full-thickness biopsy from the ileum demonstrated infiltration of eosinophils in all three layers of the intestine. There were no clinical features or investigations suggestive of parasitic disease, other diseases associated with eosinophilia, or autoimmune disease. Further investigations showed a highly positive ANA, positive p-ANCA, but did not meet the criteria to diagnose a specific autoimmune disease. The eosinophilia responded to an elimination diet with gradual resolution of eosinophilia and effusions, and once it reappeared after introduction of a normal diet. Conclusion. EGE presenting as peripheral blood and ascitic fluid eosinophilia with the presence of pleural and/or peritoneal effusions is uncommon. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis can be associated with autoantibody positivity without any evidence of overt autoimmune disease manifestations. Elimination diet can be used as a potential option to prevent recurrences of EGE.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the digestive tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, with an approximate prevalence ranging from 1 in 100,000 to 28 in 100,000 population in different studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Up to 50% of patients having EGE can have a personal or family history of atopic disease, including asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and drug or food intolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. Emerging evidence for the pathogenesis of EGE points towards immunoglobulin E-mediated allergy and delayed T-helper type 2 response triggered by a variety of stimuli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Additionally, interleukins 3–5 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha are involved in eosinophil recruitment, homing, and prolonging eosinophilic action in the intestinal wall and are considered potential targets for molecular therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】EGE is classified into three types on the basis of the depth of eosinophilic infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. They are mucosal, muscular, and serosal. While the mucosal variety is the most common, the serosal variety remains the rarest. Clinical features vary depending on the location, extent, and depth of infiltration of the gastrointestinal wall. Clinical presentation is usually heterogeneous. Reported clinical presentations include abdominal pain or discomfort, changes in bowel habits with increased or reduced frequency of bowel opening, mucous in stools, per rectal bleeding, tenesmus, intractable vomiting, and abdominal distension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1,3\\]</u>. With serosal involvement, ascites can occur, and rarely it may present with features of intestinal obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis requires three criteria to be met, which include clinical suspicion, histological evidence of eosinophilic infiltration of bowel, and exclusion of other pathological conditions which give rise to hypereosinophilia. To arrive at a histological diagnosis, a peak count of >15 intraepithelial eosinophils per high-power field is recommended as an absolute minimum number to arrive at a diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Additional features that are not pathognomonic but may be helpful include eosinophil microabscesses, surface layering of eosinophils, basal layer hyperplasia, papillary lengthening, degranulating eosinophils, and lamina propria fibrosis and inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Dietary modification and oral steroids are the two main treatment modalities used in eosinophilic gastroenteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Resolution of clinical symptoms, maintenance of histologic remission, and prevention of long-term complications such as remodeling and stricture formation of the bowel are the goals of therapy. Long-term steroid use raises the concern of common adverse reactions. Therefore, dietary therapy is considered an attractive treatment option. The available dietary approaches include an exclusive elemental diet with an amino acid-based complete liquid formulation, an allergy test-directed elimination diet, and an empiric elimination diet that excludes common disease-triggering foods. Still, there are no prospective studies comparing the efficacy of the different dietary approaches on EGE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【6】EGE with a presence of autoimmune antibodies without any features of autoimmune disease is an unusual presentation not reported before in the literature. We report a rare presentation of a patient diagnosed to have eosinophilic gastroenteritis who had positive autoimmune markers and showed clinical and biochemical improvement with an elimination diet to maintain remission.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present a 38-year-old previously healthy male who admitted with progressive left-sided abdominal pain involving the periumbilical and epigastric region. Pain was dull with no radiation and progressed over a week. On the eighth day of the illness, he developed several episodes of watery stools and had no blood or mucus. Six months prior to this episode, he experienced a similar episode which lasted for two weeks and resolved spontaneously without any medication. On systemic inquiry, the patient did not have any history of arthritis, vasculitic rash, frothy urine, nasal polyps, a history of food allergy or atopy, asthma, or a history suggestive of neuropathy or vasculitis. He did not notice any adverse reaction to a specific food.\n\n【9】On examination, the patient was afebrile, not pale, and had difficulty in breathing. He was tachycardic with a pulse rate of 116 beats per min, and his blood pressure was normal. There were bilateral pleural effusions (more prominent on the right side) with shifting flank dullness in the abdomen. He did not have lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or ankle oedema. Initial blood counts showed marked leukocytosis with predominantly eosinophils (white cell count 14,200 × 10<sup>3</sup>/microliter, eosinophil count 5,580 × 10<sup>3</sup>/microliter). Blood picture showed severe eosinophilia with normal cellular morphology. The stool full report was negative for amoeba, ova, or cysts. Stool culture was negative. Liver function tests including albumin and globulin were normal and so were the inflammatory markers (ESR 14 mm/1<sup>st</sup> hour, CRP 27 mg/L (normal less than 8)). Renal function and urine analysis were normal. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of significant pleural effusion and ascites. Ascitic fluid was aspirated, and the full report revealed the presence of protein 5.4 g/dl and white blood cells of 420 per cumm of which 95% were eosinophils. The serum IgE level was 774.2 IU/ml (normal range for adults <100 IU/ml). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and histology from serial biopsies from the oesophagus were normal.\n\n【10】Since the ascitic fluid full report showed predominantly eosinophils with high protein concentration, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and chest was ordered. It showed moderate pleural effusion on the right side  with gross ascites within the peritoneal cavity. Mucosal thickening of the wall of the gastric antrum, duodenum, and small bowel  was noted and suggested to investigate for the presence of gastric lymphoma or small bowel inflammation. However, mediastinal or visceral lymphadenopathy was not observed on imaging. Thereafter, we arranged a laparoscopic-guided assessment and a full-thickness biopsy from the ileum. Although no macroscopic abnormalities were detected, histology revealed moderate inflammation in the lamina propria, which is comprised of a significant number of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and a few plasma cells. Inflammation extended into the submucosa into the muscularis propria, which showed many intramural eosinophils (>20/hpf). The overall appearance favored the diagnosis of eosinophilic serositis.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography of the chest showing right-sided pleural effusion.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography of the abdomen showing thickened mucosa of the small intestine.</u>\n\n【13】His antinuclear antibody titer (an indirect immunofluorescent method) was high (1 : 1280), anti-double stranded (ds) DNA antibody was negative, and the rheumatoid factor was 64 IU/ml (normal range less than 8 IU/ml). Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA/MPO was positive, whereas cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA/PR3) was negative. Both tests were carried out by the indirect immunofluorescent method and confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\n【14】Initially, the patient was treated with a course of antiworm treatment and diethylcarbamazine, with poor clinical and haematological response. The eosinophil count rose up to 11,000 × 10<sup>3</sup>/microliter. After arriving at the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis/serositis, the patient was initiated on an elimination diet with clinical resolution of symptoms and haematological improvement after a week. Therefore, we did not initiate him on oral steroids. In this particular diet plan, the patient was asked to abstain from six types of food which are considered probable food allergens including milk and dairy products, egg, soy, tree nut or peanut, and sea food (fish/shellfish) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. During the follow-up at six weeks, the absolute eosinophil count dropped to less than 500 × 10<sup>3</sup>/microliter. In a later time, when we did a stepwise reintroduction of individual food items, and we observed that after several weeks of introduction of fish, his eosinophil count rose to 1000 × 10<sup>3</sup>/microliter. After withdrawal of fish, the eosinophil count reduced to 300 × 10<sup>3</sup>/microliter after several weeks. Thereafter, he was advised to avoid fish and he did not have any symptoms to suggest a clinical recurrence. He was followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months after discharge with no recurrence of symptoms, eosinophilia, or features of an autoimmune disease. During the follow-up period, he continued to avoid fish but consumed other food.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is an emerging disease which could present in many ways with respect to the severity and site of involvement. Our patient presented with a relapsing and a remitting course of vague complaints of abdominal pain and distension with loose stools, and the clinical and ultrasonic examination revealed pleural effusions and ascites. The main diagnostic clue was the presence of blood and ascitic fluid eosinophilia, which led us to perform an ileal full-thickness biopsy which showed abundant eosinophils. There was no evidence to suggest parasitic infection, and there was no convincing evidence to suggest autoimmune disease.\n\n【17】One of the major reasons that make this presentation unique is the positivity of markers of autoimmunity with a significant ANA titer, positive rheumatoid factor, positive p-ANCA, in the absence of autoimmune disease up to 2 years of follow-up. Though eosinophilic gastroenteritis has been diagnosed in a significant number of patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms, it has been described rarely to be associated with rheumatological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, Sjogren’s syndrome, overlap syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, polymyositis, and scleroderma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>. All these cases had clinical features of autoimmune disease during the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>. Aslanidis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> described a case of EGE in a young female having systemic lupus erythematosus and limited scleroderma with positive antinuclear antibodies, antiribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP), anti-DNA and anti-β2-glycoprotein antibodies presenting with abdominal pain and ascites. In a systematic review, twenty cases of connective tissue disease associated with eosinophilic gastroenteritis were identified. Among them, the majority had systemic lupus erythematosus (35%) and rheumatoid arthritis (20%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Avgerinos et al. described a patient who had Churg-Strauss syndrome diagnosed five years back, presenting with chronic diarrhea for one-year duration. His upper and lower gastrointestinal tract biopsies showed eosinophilic infiltration of the lamina propria and muscularis mucosa consistent with eosinophilic gastroenteritis. The patient was treated with prednisolone and later with methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【18】All the above-described patients had met definitive diagnostic criteria of a connective tissue disorder, but our patient, though he had serological evidence, did not have any clinical manifestation even after 2 years of follow-up. In the literature, we did not come across any patient with eosinophilic gastroenteritis having positive autoimmune markers without fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of any autoimmune disease. Our patient did not have any evidence of autoimmune disease or did not meet the criteria to diagnose autoimmune disease associated with hypereosinophilia and yet had autoantibody screening positive for rheumatoid factor, ANA in a high titer, and p-ANCA. We think that he could be having an evolving connective tissue disorder such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Therefore, we suggest to perform autoimmune antibody screening in patients with EGE.\n\n【19】Our patient had similar episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea in the past, but resolved without any intervention. Though this time he had disabling symptoms, it could have improved spontaneously or by implementation of dietary restrictions. The most commonly used treatment strategies include steroids and dietary treatment, which include an elemental diet or elimination diet. The elimination diet includes either of empiric removal of common trigger foods or allergic test-directed elimination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Currently, most of the studies on the six-food elimination diet are conducted among patients with eosinophilic esophagitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. As our patient had normal gastroscopic findings and histology, it was quite difficult to interpret his clinical course from the available literature. Dietary intervention, including the elemental diet and six-food elimination diet, could be effective measures to induce and maintain histological (and clinical) remission in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A case report describes the use of a multiple-food elimination diet to induce disease remission in a 22-year-old woman with eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Initially, she was treated with oral steroids and had recurrence of symptoms on withdrawal of the drug. During dietary treatment, they identified dairy products and eggs as likely causative foods exacerbating symptoms, and thereafter, they could manage the patient without prednisolone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Similarly, we attempted an elimination diet in our patient who had eosinophilic gastroenteritis. This could suggest that an allergic predisposing factor may have brought out a relapse at the presentation of the disease or there could be a link between autoimmunity and allergy. Steroid use can be a nonspecific immunosuppressant to treat autoimmune or allergic conditions with significant side effects on long-term usage. It has been described that mast cells, which play a key role in allergic reactions, can produce inflammatory mediators which can predispose the development of autoimmune processes. Activation of protein kinases by inflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses could contribute to both allergic and autoimmune diseases. This is further suggested by the presence of autoantibodies in some allergic conditions, elucidating an autoimmune basis for these conditions, as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Furthermore, pathogenesis-related research is required to identify the triggers and pathways in view of developing a specific targeted therapy. However, we suggest to undertake an elimination diet as a plausible option to prevent recurrences of EGE and to maintain remission.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】EGE presenting as peripheral blood and ascitic fluid eosinophilia with the presence of pleural and/or peritoneal effusions is uncommon. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis can be associated with autoantibody positivity without any evidence of overt autoimmune disease manifestation. An elimination diet can be used as a potential option to prevent recurrences in EGE. This could suggest an autoimmune allergic pathogenesis for EGE.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Here we describe three cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes in pregnancy treated at our clinic between 2009 and 2012. Two patients came for specialist examination during pregnancy, the third after pregnancy. These women had no prior overt diabetes and shared certain characteristics, that is, no family diabetes history, age over 35, normal prepregnancy BMI, need for insulin therapy as of the early weeks of pregnancy, and high-titer anti-GAD antibody positivity. The patients had persistent diabetes after delivery, suggesting that they developed adult-onset type 1 diabetes during pregnancy. About 10% of GDM patients become pancreatic autoantibody positive and the risk of developing overt diabetes is higher when two or more autoantibodies are present (particularly GAD and ICA). GAD-Ab shows the highest sensitivity for type 1 diabetes prediction. We need to bear in mind that older patients might conceivably develop an adult-onset type 1 diabetes during or after pregnancy. So we suggest that women with GDM showing the described clinical features shall be preferably tested for autoimmunity. Pregnant patients at risk of type 1 diabetes should be identified to avoid the maternal and fetal complications and the acute onset of diabetes afterwards.\n\n【2】From 5% to 10% of diabetic patients have type 1 diabetes, which results from an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic cells. Autoantibodies directed against insulin, islet cells, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD), and tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 are markers of this immune destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Here we describe three cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes in pregnancy treated at our clinic between 2009 and 2012.\n\n【3】The first concerns a 42-year-old woman who was referred for specialist examination in her 16th week of gestation (g.w.) to confirm a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Her family history was negative for diabetes and her prepregnancy BMI was normal (22.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Based on her glycemic profiles, insulin therapy was begun in her 17th g.w. in addition to the already-prescribed dietary restrictions. During the pregnancy, the patient’s metabolic control was good (mean HbA1c 5.4%). The baby was delivered in the 39th g.w. (birth weight 3265 g). Postpartum OGTT revealed diabetes mellitus (2 h plasma glucose >200 mg/dL) with low blood insulin values (5–23.6 mU/mL), C-peptide 1.1 ng/mL, and anti-GAD Ab positivity (>2000 U/L), while HbA1c was 5.9%. In October 2010, the patient resumed insulin therapy and now has 4 injections a day, but her metabolic control remains poor (HbA1c 9.5%).\n\n【4】The second patient was 39 years old when she came for her first specialist examination. Her family history was negative for diabetes. Between 2004 and 2007 she had successfully completed two pregnancies, both complicated by gestational diabetes. Her prepregnancy BMI was normal (20.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). GDM had been diagnosed in the third trimester of the first pregnancy, but within the first two weeks of the second. Insulin therapy was needed in both pregnancies (right from the first few weeks in the second). Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed on postpartum OGTT after the second pregnancy. The patient took metformin therapy for several months, with no benefit. In April 2011, she was hospitalized and laboratory tests revealed: glycemia 170 mg/dL; HbA1c 7.3%, C-peptide 1.2 ng/mL; and anti-GAD Ab positivity (2000 U/L). She is currently on dietary restrictions alone.\n\n【5】The third patient was 36 years old and came for specialist examination in her 28th g.w. in February 2012. Her family history was negative for diabetes and her prepregnancy BMI was normal (22.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Given her poor glycemic profiles, insulin therapy was begun immediately in addition to dietary restrictions. In the 29th g.w. blood tests revealed anti-GAD Ab positivity (268 U/L) and low fasting plasma C-peptide levels (1.8 ng/mL). During the pregnancy, the patient’s metabolic control was good (mean HbA1c 6%). The baby was delivered in the 35th g.w. (birth weight 2520 g). The patient’s metabolic control is currently good (HbA1c 5.6%) and she is on dietary restrictions alone.\n\n【6】It is important to emphasize that these women had no prior overt diabetes and they did not meet the diagnostic criteria of diabetes (i.e. FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL or 2 h plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL during an OGTT, or HbA1c ≥6.5%, or random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL). Before they were referred to us for examination, all three patients had fasting plasma glucose levels below 126 mg/dL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【7】These pregnant women shared certain characteristics, that is, no family history of diabetes, age over 35 years, normal prepregnancy BMI, need for insulin therapy as of the early weeks of pregnancy, high-titer anti-GAD antibody positivity, and low fasting plasma C-peptide levels. The patients also had persistent diabetes after delivery, suggesting that they developed adult-onset type 1 diabetes during their pregnancy.\n\n【8】The literature on autoimmunity and pregnancy is limited. In most cases, GDM is characterized by a higher insulin resistance and lower insulin secretion, both of which are defects typical of type 2 diabetes. Women with GDM are consequently believed to be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. About 10% of GDM patients become pancreatic autoantibody positive, however, so—although type 1 diabetes generally develops in younger people (under 30 years old)—we need to bear in mind that older patients might conceivably develop an adult-onset type 1 diabetes during or after pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>.\n\n【9】In our personal experience, these are the first cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes occurring during pregnancy and our findings confirm the importance of identifying the risk of patients developing this type of diabetes.\n\n【10】Most studies have demonstrated that the presence of diabetes-related autoimmunity in patients with GDM predicts the occurrence of type 1 diabetes; the risk of developing overt diabetes is higher when two or more autoantibodies are present (particularly GAD and ICA). Füchtenbusch et al. have reported that two years after delivery the risk was 17% with one antibody, 31% with two antibodies, and 84% with three antibodies positivity. In the study of Nilsson et al. 83% of the patients with GDM and positivity for at least one autoantibody developed type 1 diabetes 4 years after delivery. Moreover, GAD-Ab shows the highest sensitivity for type 1 diabetes prediction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In addition, it has been found out that women with GDM and autoantibodies more frequently need insulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>; however, it has to be underlined that these patients are younger than those included in our case reports.\n\n【12】Up to now there are not guidelines about which patients should be checked for autoantibodies. According to our experience, we suggest that women with GDM showing clinical features as no family history of diabetes, normal pre-pregnancy BMI, need for insulin therapy in the early weeks of pregnancy, and age higher than 35 years, shall be preferably tested for autoimmunity.\n\n【13】Pregnant patients at risk of type 1 diabetes should be identified to avoid the maternal and fetal complications of this form of diabetes developing during the pregnancy and, very importantly, the acute onset of diabetes afterwards.

{"seq_id": "5661ecb6-750e-4a42-bca1-349edbf7bbbb", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Case Summary. We present a case of a young female with subacute symptoms of cough and progressive dyspnoea. On evaluation, the patient was diagnosed as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia based on her histopathological reports. However, her significant elevation of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels which drop after treatment with oral steroids, relapse, and clinical presentation pointed towards sarcoidosis as clinical diagnosis. Discussion. Here, in this patient, transbronchial biopsy was suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia along with chest X-ray, and the HRCT finding was also favouring the same. But in this case, we have also seen elevated levels of serum ACE which dropped significantly to the normal level along with a complete clearance of lesions with systemic steroids, and this favours sarcoidosis. Also, the recurrence was in different areas of the lung, and lesions once again responded both clinically and radiologically to steroids with a consistent drop in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, which again is a feature common in sarcoidosis. In COP, often complete clearance of the lesions is seldom seen, even though they do respond to steroids but not as dramatically as in our case. Also, recurrence of the lesion with BOOP at different sites is uncommon as it generally progresses in the same site. Conclusion. This case report suggests that sarcoidosis as a possible cause of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is worth considering with the mixed spectrum of presentation as in our case. And to our knowledge, this type of presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with sarcoidosis as an overlap disease is very rare, and this possibility needs to be explored by more series of such cases.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia earlier known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is clinically characterized by subacute or chronic respiratory disease for a duration of 2 weeks to 2 months. Usual presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia will be persistent with dry cough and breathlessness. Pathologically, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia was defined by the presence of granulation tissue in the bronchiolar lumen, alveolar duct, and some alveoli, associated with a variable degree of interstitial and air space infiltration by mononuclear cells and foamy macrophages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Various associations of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with many drugs, connective tissue disorders, hematological malignancy, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, infections, inflammatory bowel disease, inhalation injury, irradiation injury, and transplantation have been reported in the literature, except for an unlikely cluster of patients with association of sarcoidosis and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Summary\n\n【5】A 32-year-old female with no comorbid illness presented with dry cough and progressive dyspnoea for 3 weeks with no history of expectoration, fever, haemoptysis, night sweats, weight loss, myalgia, arthralgia, muscle weakness, or rash. Oral antibiotics were consumed with no symptomatic relief. She was a housewife with no history of exposure to mineral dust, silica, asbestos, fumes, and drugs.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed a healthy well-built female with a BP of 100/80 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and a saturation of 94% in room air. No pallor, clubbing or cyanosis, lymphadenopathy, oedema, or skin lesions were observed.\n\n【7】Initial laboratory investigations showed an elevated ESR of 90 and an elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) level of 83, as against a normal level of 52 IU, with normal hemogram and other biochemistry and electrolyte assays. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-dsDNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (C/P-ANCA), rheumatoid factor, and serology for HIV, HCV, and HBsAg were negative. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli and other routine bacteriology tests were negative.\n\n【8】The pulmonary function test showed a mild restrictive pattern. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates . High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest showed peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe . Bronchoscopy with brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies were done.BAL was found to be negative for malignancy. Cultures of bacterial pathogens and acid-fast bacilli were also found to be negative by GeneXpert. The BAL study showed endobronchial cells with alveolar dust-laden macrophages with acute and chronic inflammatory cells. Transbronchial lung biopsy was performed, and histology  showed air space consolidation with fibrinous exudation and polymorph and macrophage infiltration, along with polypoidal proteinous layer in the alveolar spaces composed of granulation tissue, with alveolar septa showing moderately dense chronic inflammatory infiltrates (Masson bodies), all were suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP).\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest X-ray showing bilateral interstitial infiltrates.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Figure 3 </u>\n\n【11】HRCT chest showing peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Low-power examination shows plugs of granulation tissue in bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 High-power examination shows Masson bodies that are rounded nodules of granulation tissue in alveolar spaces.</u>\n\n【14】The patient was treated with systemic steroids to which the patient responded dramatically with a clinical and significant radiological clearance  and a decrease in serum ACE to normal.

Discussion\n\n【19】The differential diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) includes diseases like community-acquired pneumonia, idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. In our case, with the persistence of symptoms and lack of response to antibiotics, we diverged from bacterial or viral pneumonia. We excluded the diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with clinic-pathological collaboration. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) has a similar clinical and radiographical presentation to subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. We excluded the disease because of the absence of a known exposure to an aetiological agent and the absence of poorly formed granulomas on lung biopsy. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia can have a similar clinical and radiographical presentation to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP). In chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, blood eosinophilia is usually higher than 1500/mm<sup>3</sup> and bronchoalveolar eosinophilia is higher than 25%. In our case, blood and BAL eosinophils were within the normal range. Also in histopathological patterns, a significant eosinophilic infiltration is seen, and the eosinophilic infiltration is often accompanied by foci of necrosis and proteinaceous debris, termed eosinophilic microabscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. With these findings, we excluded all other diseases and established the diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP).\n\n【20】In our case report, a 32-year-old female presented with dry cough and progressive dyspnoea with high ESR and elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, with the imaging study showing peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe and biopsy, suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with granulation tissue and underwent remission of both clinical and radiological findings on treatment with systemic steroids.\n\n【21】Here, in this patient, transbronchial biopsy was suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) along with chest X-ray, and the HRCT finding was also favouring cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Here, we came to the final diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia after excluding all other possible conditions as well.In the absence of other contributing disease processes, diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia can be demonstrated by typical histological features in the patients with a compatible clinical and radiological pattern.\n\n【22】But in our case, we have also seen elevated levels of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) which responded to oral steroids. The features that favoured sarcoidosis were that there was a significant clearance of lesions with steroids. Also, the recurrence was in different areas of the lung once steroids were discontinued, and lesions once again responded both clinically and radiologically to steroids with a consistent drop in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, suggesting a sarcoidosis aetiology to the disease.\n\n【23】In cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP), often complete clearance of the lesions is seldom seen, even though they do respond to steroids but not as dramatically as in our case. Also, recurrence of the lesion in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) at different sites is uncommon as it generally progresses in the same site. Distinguishing cryptogenic organizing pneumonia from sarcoidosis can be difficult. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia frequently occurs in 40 to 60 years, and sarcoidosis usually occurs in the age group of 20 to 50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Both entities may present with almost same clinical symptoms. The histological appearance of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and sarcoidosis differs as mononuclear cells and Langerhans giant-cell granulomas characterize acinar infiltrates of sarcoidosis, whereas cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is characterized by fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and granulation buds in the distal airways and alveoli. The BAL study will show mononuclear cells in sarcoidosis and mixed cell populations with a modestly increased lymphocyte number in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Since our patient had a significant clinical, radiological, and pathological overlap of symptoms which could not be explained by either cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or sarcoidosis alone, an overlap of sarcoidosis-cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) was a strong possibility.\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【25】In conclusion, for this patient, we came to a diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis as a possible cause of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is worth considering with the mixed spectrum of presentation as in our case. And to our knowledge, this type of presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with sarcoidosis as an overlap disease is very rare, and this possibility needs to be explored by more series of such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

She presented with dyspnea, cough, and fatigue. Her chest CT scan revealed nodular opacities in the right upper lung. A fine needle aspirate biopsy culture yielded Phaeoacremonium and surgical pathology of the biopsy showed chronic inflammation. We successfully treated her with posaconazole and managed drug interactions between posaconazole and tacrolimus. This is the second reported case of biopsy-proven pulmonary infection by Phaeoacremonium in a kidney transplant recipient and successfully treated with posaconazole.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Phaeoacremonium species are well known plant pathogens causing stunted growth and dieback of various woody hosts especially grapevines and have been isolated from necrotic woody tissue of Prunus species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Phaeoacremonium species are dematiaceous fungi characterized by the presence of melanin or melanin-like pigments and are widely distributed in the environment particularly in soil, wood, and decomposing plant debris. Phaeohyphomycosis is a collective term for cutaneous, subcutaneous, and systemic disease caused by dematiaceous fungi. Pulmonary phaeohyphomycosis is a rare opportunistic infection of immunocompromised hosts. A review of 34 cases of dematiaceous fungal infections in organ transplant recipients revealed an overall mortality of 57% among patients with systemic disease and 7% among those with skin, soft-tissue, or joint infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】This is only the second case of biopsy-proven pulmonary infection by Phaeoacremonium in a kidney transplant recipient and the first report of successful treatment with posaconazole. Moreover, management of drug interactions between posaconazole and tacrolimus was successfully done, thereby preventing supratherapeutic levels of tacrolimus and avoiding kidney injury.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 49-year-old Caucasian female who underwent a living related kidney transplant 6 years before presented with progressive dyspnea, cough, and fatigue over 6 months that failed to improve after the administration of several antibiotic courses. She had been on tacrolimus and prednisone for maintenance immunosuppression. She lived in a rural area, had exposure to chicken sheds and barns, and was a gardener. A chest CT scan revealed nodular opacities in the right upper lobe 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>, and she underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial fine needle aspiration biopsy of the right upper lobe nodules.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Chest CT scan before starting posaconazole showing reticulonodular opacities in the right upper lobe. (b) CT scan one month after starting posaconazole showing resolution of most of the opacities. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】Phaeoacremonium species grew from the biopsy culture within four days of incubation. Identification was assigned based on macroscopic and microscopic morphology. Initially, the surface of the mold was olive in color, becoming greyish-black upon subculture. The texture was velvety, and the reverse was black. Microscopically, pigmented hyphae with tapering, funnel-shaped phialides were observed, and conidia were hyaline and oblong, forming clusters at the tip of the phialides. Macroscopic and microscopic morphology was consistent with Phaeoacremonium species. Surgical pathology of the biopsy showed chronic inflammation but no fungal hyphae. Culture for acid fast bacilli from the biopsy specimen was negative for mycobacteria. Culture of bronchial fluid yielded Dactylaria constricta and few Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex.\n\n【9】Given that her biopsy culture yielded Phaeoacremonium and showed chronic inflammation, we started oral posaconazole 200 mg QID and reduced her tacrolimus dose from 2 mg BID to 1 mg Q day. A repeat chest CT scan one month after the institution of antifungal therapy showed improvement 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>, and she reported reduced cough and shortness of breath. Two months after commencing treatment, we changed her posaconazole dose to 400 mg BID for greater ease of administration. She received posaconazole for 4 months and her symptoms resolved .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Graph showing serum creatinine and blood tacrolimus levels before, during, and after posaconazole treatment with tacrolimus dose adjustments. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】To et al. reported the first case of biopsy-proven Phaeoacremonium parasiticum lung infection in a kidney transplant recipient. In contrast to our case, the patient was severely immunocompromised due to chemotherapy for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. He showed initial improvement with voriconazole and caspofungin but succumbed after a prolonged period of neutropenic fever. Shah et al. described a case of probable Phaeoacremonium lung infection in a lung transplant recipient. The patient developed cavitary lung nodules in the native lung a few months after single lung transplantation. Biopsy of one of the nodules showed chronic inflammation with possible granulomatous lesions. Phaeoacremonium parasiticum grew only from the bronchoalveolar lavage culture but not from the biopsy culture. The patient improved after the administration of voriconazole and caspofungin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 26\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Phaeoacremonium species are typically isolated from thorns, wood, and soil. Human infection can be caused by traumatic implantation or occurs in the setting of immunocompromising conditions. Twenty-seven cases of human infections with Phaeoacremonium species have been reported in the literature. In immunocompetent hosts, Phaeoacremonium has been reported to cause subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis, osteomyelitis, endophthalmitis, and onychomycosis. Successful outcomes have been achieved with debridement and antifungals . In immunocompromised patients, Phaeoacremonium causes more severe disease and has been reported to cause endocarditis, brain abscesses, cavitary lung nodules, and disseminated infections. Disseminated infections in severely immunocompromised hosts are associated with poor outcomes and death .\n\n【14】Table 1 Skin and subcutaneous infection, osteomyelitis, endophthalmitis, and onychomycosis due to Phaeoacremonium species.\n\n【15】Table 2 Invasive and disseminated infections due to Phaeoacremonium species.\n\n【16】The other dematiaceous fungus isolated from this patient was Dactylaria constricta. It grew only from culture of bronchial fluid and not from the biopsy. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) also grew only from the culture of bronchial fluid. Given our patient’s exposure history (gardening, exposure to sheds and barns) and no growth of these organisms from the biopsy specimen, it is likely that these organisms were merely colonizers of her respiratory tract and not pathogens. Moreover, resolution of her illness without treatment for MAC suggests that it was not a pathogen.\n\n【17】There is no standard antifungal regimen described for Phaeoacremonium in the literature. Posaconazole is the most recently approved triazole with an extended spectrum of activity against a wide variety of fungi. Posaconazole was chosen over other azoles because it is well tolerated and has a favorable side effect profile and a low potential of drug interactions compared to other azoles. Posaconazole inhibits the metabolism of calcineurin inhibitors. Failure to adjust tacrolimus dosing can result in supratherapeutic levels of tacrolimus and harm the kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Our patient responded well to the treatment with no relapse of infection during 4 years of follow-up.

Clinically, this lesion resembled an actinic keratosis. Although histological examination revealed a focal acantholysis, the finding of a moderate-to-severe dysplastic epithelium was consistent with the diagnosis of acantholytic actinic keratosis with moderate/severe dysplasia. Nevertheless, the complete resolution of the lip lesion after systemic therapy for pemphigus vulgaris led us to reconsider the possibility that we were dealing with a pemphigus vulgaris with unusual clinical and histological features. The previously reported cytological dysplasia was better regarded reactive rather than neoplastic, likely as the result to the inflammatory injury.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】A 67-year-old woman was referred to our department with a 4-month history lesions on her face, trunk, and upper extremities. The lesions consisted of multiple painful blisters and erosions covered with crusts. General laboratory screening, including a complete blood count, was within normal limits. The Tzanck test of a smear from the base of a blister on a trunk lesion showed many acantholytic cells. The indirect immunofluorescence test showed that the serum of the patient contained IgG antibodies that reacted with the intercellular region of normal squamous epithelium. The direct immunofluorescence test, performed in a cutaneous biopsy, showed IgG and C3 deposits to the full thickness of the epidermis. The immunoblotting revealed the presence of antibodies directed at the extracytoplasmic domain of the 130 kD epithelial desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein 3. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris was made. Unexpectedly, a dry whitish scaly lesion of the upper lip, that resembled clinically an actinic keratosis, was also observed 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Therefore, we decided to perform an incisional biopsy on this lesion. Histological examination showed acantholysis and a diffuse cytological atypia of the epidermis, consisting of cells with enlarged, vesicular, focally hyperchromatic, nuclei 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>. The underlying dermis showed diffuse and marked inflammatory infiltrate, with lymphocytes and eosinophils, that focally involved the epidermis. Solar elastosis and vascular ectasia were additionally seen 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. Although the finding of acantholysis was consistent with the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris, the possibility of an acantholytic actinic keratosis with moderate/severe dysplasia could not be completely ruled out. We decided to undertake the therapy for pemphigus vulgaris and to wait for the outcome of the lesion of the lip. Therapy with systemic prednisone (50 mg/die), cyclophosphamide (25 mg/die), and erythromycin (1800 mg/die) was administered with good results.

The mouth lesions, including those occurring in the lip, clinically present as fragile, flaccid blister, which develops on normal or erythematous skin/mucosa, and rapidly rupture, leaving a painful crusted, bloody erosion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Histologically, these lesions are characterized by rounded acantholytic cells with intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm, pyknotic nuclei, and perinuclear halos. The most striking feature in our case was the finding of a dry whitish scaly lesion in the upper lip, that closely resembled of an actinic keratosis. Histologically, this lesion showed focal acantholytic epidermis with moderate-to-severe cytological atypia in association with a diffuse and marked dermal inflammatory infiltrate. However, the resolution of the lip lesion after systemic therapy for pemphigus vulgaris was strongly in favour of the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris with unusual clinical and histological features. In this regard, the detected cytological atypia was better regarded to be reactive rather than dysplastic, likely as the result of diffuse dermal inflammatory injury. Therefore, although benign and malignant tumours may occasionally arise in the context of some acantholytic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>, the diagnosis of dysplasia/in situ carcinoma should be made with extreme caution in patients affected by pemphigus vulgaris.\n\n【8】In conclusion, considering that the observation we made may be seen in many patients affected by pemphigus vulgaris, such patients would benefit more from the therapy for pemphigus vulgaris instead of a biopsy.

In patients with recurrent chest infection, the physician should check for the possibility of FBA and prompt for a referral to a tertiary center for further evaluation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Foreign body aspiration (FBA) is a common medical problem. Prompt action needs to be taken for early treatment and minimize the severity and fatal consequences. In the US, FBA leads to 7% of accidental death among children age less than four-year-old and 75 to 85% of accidental death in children under the age of 15 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. FBA in adults mostly is seen in the sixth or seventh decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. FBA can be further classified into organic and inorganic materials. Most organic materials causing FBA among children are nuts and seeds while among adults are food and bones. The most common types of inorganic FBA in children are beads, coins, pins, small parts of toys, or school pieces of equipment, i.e. pen caps. Dental prostheses, pills, and tops from beverage cans are the commonest FBA materials found among adult populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 24-year-old girl who has no medical illness was presented to the hospital with a one-year history of chronic cough and chest infection. She also had a loss of appetite and loss of weight for the past year. She was investigated for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and it turned out to be negative. She noticed that her cough was getting worse, and she also had an episode of hemoptysis a week before the presentation.\n\n【6】On examination, she was feverish with a temperature of 39°C. Her blood pressure was 100/56 mmHg, her heart rate was 150 beats/min, and her respiratory rate was 30 breaths/min. She was hypoxic with oxygen saturation under room air of 89%. In the emergency department, she was further deteriorating, and her oxygen saturation was dropped to 80% despite on a high flow mask. She was in respiratory distress, and we decided to intubate her. Respiratory examination revealed reduced air entry and coarse crepitations on auscultation as well as dullness on percussion over the right lower zone. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【7】Blood investigations revealed leukocytosis with a total white blood cell count of 10.4 × 10<sup>9</sup> (L). The rest of the blood investigations were normal. Chest X-ray showed a right lower lobe consolidation . Computed tomography of the lung demonstrated a collapse consolidation of the right middle and lower lobe, along with associated dilated segmental bronchioles. Diffuse patch ground-glass opacity was seen in both lung fields but worst in the left side and minimal fibrotic changes with associated pleural thickening in both apexes . Tracheal aspiration fluid culture and sensitivity had no growth after five days, and the tuberculous bacilli smear was negative. Mantoux test (purified protein derivative) was also negative. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was started on intravenous antibiotics. Unfortunately, her general condition and blood parameter were not improved; therefore, we decided to proceed with bronchoscopy. We are caught in a surprise to find a blue-colored foreign body at the entrance of the right lower lobe bronchus during the bronchoscopy . The foreign body was removed from the right lower bronchus, and it was a pen cap . After removal of the foreign body, the patient's clinical condition improved tremendously, and she was extubated. She was subsequently discharged after ten days of admission. Further history was obtained from the patient before she was discharged. She admitted that she accidentally ingested the pen cap while biting the pen cap while writing. She did not seek any medical advice at that time as she was asymptomatic.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest radiography showed right lower lobe consolidation.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Computed tomography of the lung demonstrated collapse consolidation of the right middle and lower lobe along with the lower lobe with associated dilated segmental bronchioles.

Discussion\n\n【13】FBA materials are different according to the age group. Among children, they are prone to inhale materials such as nuts, seeds, beads, coins, pins, small parts of varying toys, or school equipment such as a pen cap. The study by Adjesto et al. involving 33 children in Northern Ghana showed the commonest FBA in children was groundnuts (39.4%), and the remaining was metallic objects (21.1%). The bronchoscopic finding noted foreign bodies (FBs) mostly localized to the right (24.2%) and left (24.2%) main bronchi, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. There was a large study population conducted by Ciftci et al. in 2003 involving 663 children who suspected FBA, and 75% of them ingested organic materials such as sunflower seeds (27%), roasted chick-peas (15%), hazelnut (12%), and peanut (4%). In the same study, 25% of FBA cases involving inorganic materials which were straight pins (7%), the lid of ballpoint pens (6.2%), and plastic toy pieces (3.4%). However, the bronchoscopic finding noted FBs were mostly located in the right main bronchus (37%), left main bronchus (26%), and trachea (12%), respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The FBA in the adult is unique as the commonest materials inhaled were food, bones, dental prostheses, pills, and tops from the beverage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In our patient situation, we found pen caps which are usually found in children and toddlers. This is what happens when someone had a habit of biting the pen caps while writing and then incidentally swallowing the cap, which subsequently dislodged to the respiratory system instead of the alimentary system.\n\n【15】The symptoms and severity of FBA is variable from mild to severe, and it depends on the site of occlusion. Occlusion at the level of the larynx can cause choking and gagging. The patient will be presented with symptoms of hoarseness of voice, aphonia, and cyanosis and worst-case scenario, sudden death. Inspiratory stridor occurs when the obstruction is at the level of the trachea. However, an occlusion at the bronchus may cause cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and chest pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Chest X-ray (CXR) is essential in the diagnosis of FBA. Although 90% of the foreign bodies are radiolucent, a standard radiological workup including a posteroanterior and a lateral chest film and a lateral soft tissue neck radiograph should be done. If the patient presented within 24 hours, the CXR finding could be normal. The initial CXR finding will be unilateral or segmental hyperaeration, and the subsequent finding could be atelectasis, air trapping, pulmonary infiltrates, and mediastinal shift on expiratory film 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The gold standard approach for diagnosing FBA is by doing flexible/rigid bronchoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–13\\]</u>. Rigid bronchoscopy is the safest and preferred instrument used in the pediatric population, whereas in adults, the flexible bronchoscope is the preferred instrument for the diagnosis and removal of airway foreign bodies compared to rigid bronchoscope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 14\\]</u>. Removal of a foreign body by using bronchoscopy from the tracheobronchial area must be done by a trained and experienced person to minimize and avoid unnecessary complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Delayed complications associated with retained foreign body include nonresolving pneumonia, lung abscess, recurrent hemoptysis, lung fibrosis, obstructive emphysema, and bronchiectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>. In our patient, chronic retention of a foreign body in the bronchus lead to obstructive pneumonia. Localize obstructive bronchiectasis is one of the most important complications of a chronic FBA and may necessitate a surgical resection if it is complicated with recurrent infections. Obstructive bronchiectasis may develop many years after the unrecognized FBA. The standard surgical treatment for bronchiectasis is partial lobectomy of the affected lobe. There was a study reported that removal of the foreign body via bronchoscopy could achieve resolution of bronchiectasis and bronchial dilatation in a chronic FBA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Hence, flexible bronchoscopy should always be considered in cases with localized bronchiectasis or nonresolving pneumonia for the possibility of FBA to avoid patients from an unnecessary surgical procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】FBA should always be considered in the etiology of recurrent chest infections or hemoptysis, lung abscess, middle lobe syndrome, fibrotic changes such as scar formation, and bronchiectasis. Early suspicion of FBA among patients presented with recurrent chest infections should prompt the medical practitioner to make an early referral to a tertiary center for further evaluations. The community should be educated regarding the symptoms of foreign body aspiration so that there was no delay in seeking medical treatment. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a safe procedure for the initial diagnosis of a foreign body. It can avoid unnecessary general anesthesia and surgical resection. Moreover, the success rate of the flexible bronchoscope in removing foreign bodies can be as high as 100% in experienced hands. Removal of a foreign body can result in the resolution of lung parenchyma or bronchial pathology and hence can prevent unnecessary surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The incidence of unsuspected contralateral peritonsillar abscess identified at tonsillectomy has been reported to be between 1.9% and 24%, while the overall incidence of bilateral peritonsillar abscess is reported to reach 4.9%. Diagnosis can be based on clinical criteria or imaging techniques. As far as the treatment is concerned, it is generally accepted that the basic strategy consists of systemic antibiotics and drainage of the pus.

In our 10-year series 通用删除7(英):<u>(1999–2009)</u>, male to female ratio is about 100/63 , with the majority of the cases diagnosed between 20 and 40 years of age .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Diagnosed peritonsillar abscesses: Male to Female ratio in our 10-year series 通用删除7(英):<u>(1999–2009)</u>. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Diagnosed peritonsillar abscesses: Range of age in our 10-year series 通用删除7(英):<u>(1999–2009)</u>. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【6】Peritonsillar abscess is believed to be part of a clinical modality that progresses from acute tonsillitis to peritonsillar cellulitis and finally to peritonsillar abscess. The most common symptoms at presentation are sore throat, odynophagia (usually unilateral), dysphagia, otalgia, trismus, oral drooling, and high fever. Early diagnosis, with drainage of the abscess, is crucial to prevent perforation into the parapharyngeal/retropharyngeal space and further spread along the neck vessels to the mediastinum and skull base. Possible aspiration and severe upper airway obstruction due to epiglottis or laryngeal oedema may develop if treatment is delayed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5–7\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The methods of accomplishing drainage have been varied, and the appropriate approach to the definitive treatment of peritonsillar abscess is still controversial. The theurapeutic options, in general, include needle aspiration, incision and drainage, quinsy tonsillectomy, intravenous antibiotics, and steroid therapy. Although unilateral peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute bacterial tonsillitis, bilateral peritonsillar abscesses are quite rare. The overall incidence of bilateral PTA is reported to reach 4.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5–8\\]</u>. In most bilateral cases, an unsuspected contralateral abscess is discovered during tonsillectomy. The incidence of unsuspected contralateral peritonsillar abscess identified at tonsillectomy has been reported to be between 1.9% and 24% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5–8\\]</u>.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 19-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of our Hospital with a 6-day history of worsening odynophagia, bilateral earache, difficulty in swallowing solids, subjective fever, and significant trismus. Despite oral Clarithromycin prescribed by her GP, her symptoms worsened in the 24 hours preceding admission. Intraoral examination revealed a diffusely erythematous soft palate and uvula, with prominent swelling and midline protrusion . She showed no signs of upper airway obstruction in fiberoptic endoscopy. Laboratory tests revealed a significant increase of white blood cells, normal electrolytes, and no monocytosis.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | The bilateral Peritonsillar absesses in our case (12 hours after the initial incision and drainage which followed diagnostic needle aspiration). The incisions are still clearly visible. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】As the patient presented with significant symmetrical bulging of the soft palate, she was treated in the emergency room with a bilateral diagnostic needle aspiration (a 10 gauge needle was used) followed by bilateral incision and drainage . Computed tomography was not performed as the diagnosis was clear.\n\n【12】Although bilateral peritonsillar abscesses are quite rarely diagnosed, it must be taken into account that tonsillitis is obviously a bilateral disease in most cases. Therefore, development of a peritonsillar cellulitis or abscess is quite likely to occur bilaterally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> as happened in this case. The final progression of this—initially bilateral—disease on any side usually depends on the patient’s physical condition and systemic response to infection, on former surgical interventions in the oropharynx and on prior medical treatments, especially with antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>. In our case, the patient was treated with Clarithromycin for 5 days before her admission and was also seriously dehydrated and malnutritioned for about one week, due to her significant odynophagia. These facts could have influenced the physical history of the disease, leading to this rare bilateral diagnostic modality.\n\n【13】Foul-smelling pus was drained from both abscesses and sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures and determination of sensitivities. The aerobic culture grew few alpha-hemolytic streptococci, occasional beta-hemolytic streptococci (not group A or B), rare Staphylococcus aureus, and rare Candida albicans. The anaerobic culture grew few beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella melaninogenica and few other beta-lactamase-positive, anaerobic, gram-negative rods. No penicillin-resistant organisms were isolated.\n\n【14】The patient was admitted to our clinic and treated with intravenous clindamycin plus anti-inflammatory agents and intravenous hydration. Following treatment, the patient progressively experienced a marked alleviation of her odynophagia. She was discharged 48 hours later on a 10-day course of clindamycin. A followup intraoral examination one week later showed a well-resolved infection and normal mucosa.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Unilateral peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a common complication of acute bacterial tonsillitis and has been described since the time of Hippocrates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. However, bilateral peritonsillar abscesses are quite rare. Reports in the literature with regard to the incidence of bilateral abscesses are quite varied. The larger percentage includes cases where an unsuspected contralateral abscess was discovered during tonsillectomy. The incidence of unsuspected contralateral peritonsillar abscess identified at tonsillectomy has been reported to be between 1.9% and 24%, while the overall incidence of PTA is reported to reach 4.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5–8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】As tonsillitis is an infection mostly involving both tonsils, it is probable that progression to peritonsillar abscess also occurs bilaterally, with the developmental stages of the abscesses being different on each side. However, most authors support that the individual's systemic response to infection, antibiotics, or surgical intervention may interrupt the progression of this disease at any stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Moreover, adequate antibiotic treatment as well as incision and drainage of the obvious abscess is often likely to suppress the development and even mask the presence of a peritonsillar abscess on the opposite side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> Therefore, we do believe that the cases of bilateral abscesses are quite likely to be underreported.\n\n【18】The vast majority of peritonsillar abscesses harbor multiple organisms. The most common aerobic organisms isolated are Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus milleri, Haemophilus influenza, and streptococci group viridans, while fusobacterium and Prevotella melaninogenica are reported to be the usually involved anaerobic organisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. In our case, the culture results demonstrated quite different organisms than expected, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. This fact could be attributed to the recent treatment with Clarithromycin, as well as to multiple antibiotic treatments involved during the last 6 months, as the patient’s history revealed.\n\n【19】The intraoral appearance of a bilateral peritonsillar abscess lacks the classic asymmetry and uvula deviation that are considered to be the hallmarks of a unilateral abscess. Moreover, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, or steroid treatment may often mask the signs and symptoms of PTA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–7\\]</u>. Therefore, bilateral abscesses can be confused with other conditions such as bilateral lymphomas of the tonsils, infiltrating carcinomas of the soft palate or uvula, any tumors of the small salivary glands of the oral cavity, tonsillar cellulitis, or infectious mononucleosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–7\\]</u>. That is the reason why some authors support that contrast-enhanced CT imaging can help diagnose bilateral PTA and should be considered in the presence of marked trismus but with the absence of unilateral inflammatory findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However, contrast CT scan is quite expensive and usually not available immediately. Therefore, we believe that the diagnosis of bilateral peritonsillar abscesses should be kept in mind when the clinical presentation suggests the diagnosis of PTA, but the physical examination reveals bilateral swollen tonsils with a midline uvula. In such cases, needle aspiration is a reliable alternative diagnostic procedure as it leads to immediate and accurate diagnosis in most situations. Some authors also support the diagnostic use of intraoral ultrasound in cooperative patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–12\\]</u>, reporting significantly good results.\n\n【20】In our case, the patient presented with significant symmetrical bulging of the soft palate and significant trismus. She was treated in the emergency room with a bilateral diagnostic needle aspiration which was positive in both sides. This initial procedure was followed by bilateral incision and drainage. Computed tomography was not performed as the diagnosis was quite clear right after the bilateral diagnostic needle aspiration.\n\n【21】As far as the treatment of peritonsillar abscess is concerned, it is generally accepted that the basic strategy consists of systemic antibiotics covering group A β\\-hemolytic streptococci which is reported to be the most common offending organism and subsequent drainage of the pus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–7\\]</u>. Drainage of the pus from the abscess cavity can be accomplished via needle aspiration (sometimes ultrasound-guided), incision-drainage, or immediate (quinsy) tonsillectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–8\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The surgical treatment of peritonsillar abscess that is not complicated with upper airway obstruction still remains controversial. Immediate tonsillectomy is an easy to perform one-stage surgical procedure assuring quick relief of trismus and pain and total evacuation of the pus. Such an operation may subsequently reveal an unsuspected contralateral peritonsillar abscess as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–8\\]</u>. On the contrary, incision and drainage which is also supported by many authors is an awkward procedure, very unpleasant for the patient that could often lead to incomplete evacuation of the abscess cavity. That is the reason why the procedure is often necessary to be repeated several times. Besides, if an interval tonsillectomy is planned, such an operation could be technically more difficult because of the fibrosis of the tonsillar bed usually developed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–8\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Quinsy tonsillectomy supporters also cite the need to prevent a recurrent abscess. However, those who favor only incision and drainage state that the reccurence rate has not been clearly defined. In fact, the reported frequency of recurrent peritonsillar abscess in several series is 5.9 to 22.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Most authors accept that both needle aspiration and incision-drainage are the mainstay of management for the majority of peritonsillar abscesses and are reported to be equally effective for the treatment of the disease, whereas immediate tonsillectomy is now considered to be a reliable and safe procedure, suggested for bilateral cases, immunocompromised patients, or in cases with no response to systemic antibiotics or incision and drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–8, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【25】On the other hand, initial conservative (nonsurgical treatment) is still supported by some authors in selected cases, before taking the risk of surgical drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. This strategy is reported to be involved especially in cases of inferior pole peritonsillar abscess, provided that the patient is immunocompetent and has no significant systemic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. The patient is treated with parenteral antibiotics and is under close observation for the first 48 hours. We suggest that poor response to antibiotics, progressively deteriorating clinical status or development of other complications, should always redirect the theurapeutic plan towards the surgical management. Moreover, the authors believe that this conservative strategy could also be involved for the first 48 hours in selected cases of peritonsillar celullitis, provided that diagnostic needle aspiration is negative in both sides and there is no evidence of immunodeficiency or any clinical signs or imaging data which would make the physician to suspect a life-threatening complication.\n\n【26】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【27】Although unilateral peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute bacterial tonsillitis, bilateral abscesses are quite rarely diagnosed. The intraoral appearance of a bilateral peritonsillar abscess lacks the classic asymmetry and uvula deviation. That is the reason why the ENT surgeon must keep this diagnostic modality in mind, even if the clinical appearance is not entirely suggestive, especially if previous antibiotic or steroid treatment has been involved. Diagnosis can be supported by both imaging techniques (such as CT or intraoral ultrasound) and bilateral needle aspiration. Treatment of choice consists of systemic antibiotics and drainage of the pus via bilateral incision and drainage or immediate quinsy tonsillectomy. Initial conservative (nonsurgical treatment) is supported by some authors in selected cases, before taking the risk of a surgical approach.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Complete excision of the tract, including the cuff of surrounding cartilage, was performed. Histopathology revealed a fistular tract lined with squamous epithelium. To our knowledge, this is the first case to be reported of type I FBCA with an opening on the root of the helical crus. The low incidence and varied presentation often result in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Conclusions. In the patients with FBCA, careful recognition of atypical variants is essential for complete excision.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Work reported a classification system based on embryology and histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Type I anomalies are ectodermal in origin and arise from the duplication of the membranous external auditory canal. Type II anomalies are ectodermal and mesodermal in origin and arise from the duplication of the membranous and cartilaginous external auditory canal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The superior openings of these anomalies are commonly located on the floor of the external auditory canal. Herein, we report the first case of a branchial cleft fistula with the superior opening located on the root of the helical crus, extending into the postauricular crease.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 23-year-old man was referred to our clinic with postauricular drainage and swelling. He had a 10-year history of recurrent swelling in the postauricular area. Physical examination revealed a fistulous tract extending from the root of the helical crus to the postauricular crease. The lower opening in the postauricular area was surrounded by a reddish cystic lesion . The patient had no history of facial weakness. A preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan showed a left rim-enhancing cyst in the postauricular crease . Postauricular discharge was purulent and was treated with antibiotics. On suspicion of a branchial cleft fistula, surgical resection of the fistula was scheduled. A postauricular incision including an ellipse around the lower opening was performed. The tract and lower opening, including the surrounding skin, were excised. The tract was traced anteriorly to the helical crus and a portion of helical cartilage was excised in continuity with the tract . The tract was identified as superficial to the facial nerve. Histopathology revealed that the excised tissue was a fistula lined with squamous epithelium . The patient received intravenous antibiotics for 3 days and oral antibiotics for 2 weeks as a precautionary measure. The wound completely resolved after 1 month. During the 24-month follow-up, no sign of recurrence was found.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The opening of the fistula tract is seen on the root of the helical crus (a).

Discussion\n\n【11】FBCAs occur due to abnormal development of the branchial apparatus during weeks 4 to 7 of fetal life. The structures that develop from the first branchial cleft are the cavum conchae, external auditory canal, and outer layer of the tympanic membrane. Therefore, FBCAs are closely related to these structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Incomplete closure causes various types of first branchial cleft anomalies such as cysts, sinuses, and fistulas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The embryology of these anomalies reveals that the lesions are derived from the dorsal portion of the first branchial groove and lie between the derivatives of Meckel’s and Reichert’s cartilages. Therefore, the opening of the tract could occur anywhere, including in the external auditory canal, the postauricular region, or the neck over the angle of the mandible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Type I anomalies are purely ectodermal origin and contain squamous epithelium; this type of anomaly develops medial to the concha, often extending into the postauricular crease and ending in a cul-de-sac at the osseous-cartilaginous junction of the external auditory canal. These anomalies are usually superficial to the branch of the facial nerve. Type II anomalies are ectodermal and mesodermal in origin and thus contain adnexal skin structures and cartilages. The openings of the anomalies are usually below the angle of the mandible and extend toward the inferior part of the external auditory canal; the anomalies pass superficial to, deep to, or between the branches of the facial nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Type I FBCAs are very rare, while type II FBCAs are more frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【13】In the present case, the histopathological characteristics of the tract extending from the root of the helix to the postauricular crease showed only squamous epithelium and no cartilage. There was no visible opening of the fistula in the external auditory canal. The lesion was superficial to the facial nerve. On the basis of these characteristics, we classified the anomaly as a type I FBCA. The most frequent clinical feature of a type I FBCA is ear discharge or recurrent periauricular swelling. The rare incidence and varied presentation often lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, such as multiple incision and drainage procedures. Inappropriate treatments and recurrent infection may result in incomplete excision. When there is a history of prior infection, the recurrence rate of FBCAs can be as high as 14–22% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Definitive treatment for an FBCA is surgical excision of the entire anomaly, including a small amount of surrounding skin or cartilage. Accordingly, we excised the anomaly, including a small portion of the surrounding cartilage.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【15】Atypical variants of FBCA exist, and various presentations make diagnosis and treatment difficult. Careful examination and dissection are crucial to avoid rest of the anomalies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

ED increases the risk for injury, self-extubation, hemorrhages, and prolonged hospitalization and occurs in patients of any age but most often in children and elderly patients. However, ED in young adults is rarely reported. We presented a case of typical ED occurring in a young healthy man following an uneventful appendectomy. The causes of ED can be classified as either predisposing or precipitating factors. In this case, the unnoticeable mental stress may be the predisposing factor and the sevoflurane maintenance of anesthesia may be the precipitating factor. ED occurs at any age of patient and in any minor surgery, and anesthesiologists should do some work to prevent it from happening.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Postoperative delirium (POD) is an acute and fluctuating alteration of mental state of reduced awareness and disturbance of attention, typically occurring between 24 and 72 hours after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Emergence delirium (ED) is defined as the delirium that occurs during the transition from the sleep state to full consciousness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. ED is an adverse postoperative complication that occurs in patients of any age but most often in children with a variable incidence of 10–80% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and elderly patients between 10% and 15% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. ED increases the risk for injury, self-extubation, hemorrhages, and prolonged hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The European Society of Anesthesiology evidence-based and consensus-based guideline on POD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> states that the risk factors for POD include advanced age, combination of other systemic diseases (e.g. cerebrovascular including stroke, Parkinson’s disease, depression, and anxiety disorders), alcohol-related disorders, preoperative fluid fasting and dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, drugs with anticholinergic effects, operation site, intraoperative bleeding, operation time, and postoperative pain. Factors contributing to pediatric ED are as follows: preschool age, psychological immaturity, preoperative anxiety, surgical categories (e.g. ear, nose, and throat surgery), inhalational maintenance of anesthesia, pain, and physiological condition (e.g. hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, ED in young adults is poorly investigated. We presented a case of typical ED occurring in a young healthy man following an uneventful appendectomy and discussed the potential mechanisms.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 29-year-old man, 60 kg, body mass index 21.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, was presented for an emergency appendectomy. The acute right lower quadrant pain occurred a day before. The peripheral blood leukocyte counts (13.23 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and abdominal ultrasound examination indicated acute appendicitis, and other examinations were normal. He had a normal mental state, fair sleep and appetite, normal urination and defecation, and no change in body weight within half a year. He and his relatives had no history of drug abuse, alcohol or nicotine abuse, specific medication intake regularly, metabolic diseases, allergic reactions, treatment with psychiatric drugs, epilepsy, or neurological disorder.\n\n【6】No premedications were given. Upon arrival in the operating room, midazolam 2 mg and dexamethasone 10 mg were administered intravenously. Anesthesia was induced by intravenous injection of propofol 100 mg, sufentanil 20 μg, and rocuronium 35 mg and maintained by sevoflurane inhalation and continuous infusion of remifentanil. A size #4 laryngeal mask airway was inserted for ventilation. The surgery took 2 hours to complete and was uneventful with no significant blood loss. No adverse events, such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia, occurred during the procedure. A patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) with sufentanil 100 μg, dexmedetomidine 100 μg, and butorphanol 5 mg was used for postoperative analgesia. To accelerate emergence, a flow rate of 8 L/min with 60% O<sub>2</sub> was used to “wash out” sevoflurane after turning off the anesthesia vaporizer. About 5 min later, spontaneous breathing recovered, but his eyes were closed and he did not respond to anesthesiologist’s commands. Neostigmine 2 mg and atropine 1 mg were intravenous injected to antagonize residual rocuronium, and flumazenil 0.3 mg was injected to reverse midazolam. After 5-minute assessment of the ventilation volume and rate and capnography, the patient was extubated but was still unresponsive, and he tightly closed his eyes and began to sob with no tears and shake his head continuously (Supplementary video 1). He looked very sad. This condition lasted approximately 2 to 3 minutes, followed by somnolence with eyes closed and continuous opening and closing of his jaw that lasted approximately 3 to 5 minutes (Supplementary video 2). These two situations were repeated continuously. Vital signs were stable, and oxygen saturation remained at 97% to 100% during this period. The patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit. His wife was invited to comfort the patient, but he was still unresponsive and had no alleviation of the symptoms. This patient completely self-recovered within 5 hours without drug intervention. After recovery, the patient could not recall what happened in the past several hours. However, he felt a voice was calling him and he could not wake up. Moreover, he denied having experienced any pain associated with the surgical procedure. After a detailed history review, the patient had a little worry about his occupation mobility in the past year, but that did not meet the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder according to the 5th Edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, his mental status based on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was 24, which belongs to mild anxiety disorder. Additionally, no mental disorder and cognition impairment occurred in this patient during the 6-month follow-up.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【8】The causes of POD can be classified as either predisposing or precipitating factors. It is often difficult to pinpoint a specific cause, and most of the time, it is the sum of predisposing and precipitating factors. Thus, we screened preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors for pediatric ED and POD to discuss the potential predisposing and precipitating factors for this patient.\n\n【9】##### 3.1. Preoperative Risk Factors\n\n【10】Although preschool age and advanced age are recognized as risk factors for pediatric ED and POD, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, ED did occur in young adults as reported in this case and other previous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>, indicating that ED can occur at any age.\n\n【11】Many patients may suffer different degrees of anxiety, tension, and other adverse emotions from surgery, life, and work 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. These abnormalities can result in continuous mental stress, which affects their sleep quality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and the central nervous system, and are risk factors for POD. According to the analysis of the published ED case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>, most of the young patients had mental state abnormalities after medical history review. In our case, the patient had a mild anxiety disorder based on BAI, which may be the predisposing factor for this ED.\n\n【12】##### 3.2. Intraoperative Risk Factors\n\n【13】Surgical type, duration, emergency surgery, blood loss, and transfusion are risk factors for POD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Surgery duration greater than 3 hours in cardiac surgery or 6 hours in head and neck cancer resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> is an independent predictor of POD. In this case, the appendectomy was a small surgery with no obvious blood loss and was completed in 2 hours. Moreover, the case of POD or ED after appendectomy had never been reported in the literature.\n\n【14】Nearly most of the anesthetic drugs have been reported to be the risk factors of POD. Midazolam was implicated in a 26-month-old child who developed delirium following 0.5 mg/kg of an oral dose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Corticosteroids have been reported to be a probable cause of delirium in a dose-dependent manner or under continuous use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. Our patient received a small dose of midazolam and dexamethasone. Thus, they are unlikely to contribute to this ED. The effect of opioids is unclear, but studies found remifentanil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> and sufentanil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> could reduce the incidence of ED. As far as we know, no studies found that rocuronium is associated with POD. Thus, remifentanil, sufentanil, and rocuronium are unlikely to be risk factors for ED in this case.\n\n【15】Propofol and volatile anesthetics are commonly used anesthetic agents. Propofol had been implicated in delirium, hallucinations, and amorous behavior in the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A case reported a 20-year-old female patient who had ED after propofol anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, recent findings suggest that low-dose propofol sedation reduces the risk of delirium in the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Moreover, this patient received only 100 mg propofol for induction. Considering the short time of elimination and the small dose, propofol is an unlikely culprit.\n\n【16】Inhalational maintenance of anesthesia is a high-risk factor for pediatric ED, but in adults, it has not been frequently reported. The incidence of ED in adults following sevoflurane anesthesia reached 11.8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Compared with total intravenous anesthesia, inhalational anesthesia is associated with a higher rate of ED in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 20\\]</u>. Thus, sevoflurane maintenance is likely to be the precipitating factor for this patient.\n\n【17】##### 3.3. Postoperative Risk Factors\n\n【18】Length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and postoperative pain were recommended as postoperative risk factors for POD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Clearly, the length of ICU stay is not the cause of ED. In this case, a PCIA was used after surgery and the patient reported no pain during the perioperative period, indicating that postoperative pain is unlikely to be the cause of ED.\n\n【19】Taken together, in this case, the likely predisposing factor for ED is his worry about occupation mobility and the precipitating factor is inhalational maintenance with sevoflurane. However, what are the potential mechanisms of the ED occurrence caused by mental stress and inhalational maintenance with sevoflurance? The most accepted theory holds that delirium is a neuropsychiatric manifestation caused by disturbances in brain metabolism and neurotransmitters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Constant stress or anxiety may lead to hypersensitivity of neural communication. The higher incidence of ED after inhalational anesthesia than total intravenous anesthesia may be primarily related to the low blood solubility and “fast in and fast out” nature of inhalational agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 22, 23\\]</u>. Therefore, it is possible to cause nonsynchronous neural excitation and abnormal neural communication; as a result, ED occurs. Although no difference of recovery time between the inhalational anesthesia and total intravenous anesthesia was found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>, which seems inconsistent with our hypothesis, we cannot ignore that the “fast out” of inhalational agents is usually achieved by manually increasing the air flow as done in this case (8 L/min), while the intravenous anesthetics are automatically eliminated. To demonstrate this hypothesis, a study comparing high “wash-out” with low “wash-out” flow rate after sevoflurane anesthesia will be carried out in our hospital.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】ED occurs at any age of patient and in any minor surgery. The unnoticeable mental stress may be the predisposing factor and the sevoflurane maintenance of anesthesia may be the precipitating factor for ED in young healthy patients who underwent minor surgery.

Introduction\n\n【3】Salmon patches, also known as nevus flammeus simplex, are the most common vascular lesions in infancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Colloquially, the lesions on the forehead and eyelids are known as “angel’s kisses” and the ones in the occipital area as “stork bite marks” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

We describe a 33-year-old female with a salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum. To our knowledge, the occurrence of a salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum in adulthood has not been reported.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 33-year-old Chinese female presented with pain in the neck, back, and shoulders as a result of a motor vehicle accident. On examination, there was tenderness and hypertonicity in the paraspinal muscles in the cervical area, paraspinal muscles in the lumbar area, and trapezius muscles. Incidentally, a salmon patch was noted on the forehead and the glabellum . The patch was faintly erythematous in color. There were no other salmon patches noted on any parts of her body. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. In particular, she did not have dysmorphic features or hepatomegaly.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | A faint erythematous patch noted on the forehead and glabellum of a 33-year-old patient. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】According to the patient, the patch was present at birth but was erythematous in color. She did not have similar erythematous patches elsewhere such as the eyelids, nose, philtrum, lips, and the occipital areas. She recalled that the patch would deepen in color with crying and vigorous activity. The color of the patch had become lighter over time. She was born to a gravida 3, para 2, 24-year-old mother at term following a normal vaginal delivery and an uncomplicated pregnancy. The mother was not on any medication or alcohol during the pregnancy. The parents were nonconsanguineous. No family members had similar skin lesions in adulthood.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Clinically, the lesions of salmon patches are scarlet to pink, flat, can be totally blanched, and usually deepen in color with vigorous activity, crying, straining with defecation, breath-holding, or changes in ambient temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In white infants, they are usually bright red or pink and are darker in oriental or black infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The lesions are most commonly found on the nape, followed by the glabella and eyelids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Other less common sites are the nasolabial folds, lips, and sacral area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Salmon patches are usually symmetric, with lesions on both eyelids or on both sides of midline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Prominent lesions in the glabella are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7\\]</u>. Salmon patches are generally not associated with extracutaneous anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In spite of their midline location, most salmon patches, except those in the sacral area, are not associated with spinal dysraphism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Salmon patches should be differentiated from port-wine stain (nevus flammeus) and congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Port-wine stain is a capillary malformation characterized clinically by persistent macular erythema and pathologically by ectasia of the papillary and superficial reticular dermal capillaries, which are otherwise lined by normal-appearing flat endothelial cells. The lesions of port-wine stain are usually unilateral and segmental and do not follow the lines of Blaschko. The lesions often become dark-red during adolescence and violaceous with advancing age. Although port-wine stain can occur anywhere on the body, the most common site is the face. The lesions grow with the child and persist throughout life. Although usually an isolated finding, port-wine stain is also a typical feature of Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.\n\n【11】Congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation simulates a salmon patch but differs from a salmon patch in that the lesion is more extensive, extending from the forehead and glabella to the nose, philtrum, and upper lip; the color is more intense; and the lesion fades more slowly or incompletely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Familial cases of congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformations have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Our patient did not have similar erythematous patches elsewhere such as the eyelids, nose, philtrum, and lips at birth. As such, in a strict sense, she did not have a congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation. Some investigators, however, believe that salmon patches on the forehead and the glabellum may be a forme fruste of congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation.\n\n【12】Salmon patches tend to fade and disappear with time; nuchal lesions tend to persist longer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10, 11\\]</u>. Leung and Telmesani examined 808 Caucasian newborn term infants (440 males and 368 females) and 1,575 Caucasian children for the presence of salmon patches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The patches were present in 192 (43.6%) males and 161 (43.8%) females in the neonatal period. The most frequent site was the nape, followed by the glabellum, eyelids, nose, and upper lip. Salmon patches were not detected in boys after age 6 and in girls after age 5. On the other hand, Oster and Nielson detected nuchal salmon patches in 501 (46.2%) of 1,084 Danish school-aged girls and 382 (35.1%) of 1,087 Danish school-aged boys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Corson found nuchal salmon patches in 13 (4.7%) of 275 medical students 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Verbov and Steinberg examined 188 hospital inpatients and old-aged residents (67 males and 121 females), aged 60 years and over, for the presence and absence of a salmon patch over the occiput and nape 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Forty (60%) of the males and 51 (42%) of the females showed typical nuchal patches. From these studies, it seems clear that salmon patches are common in the neonatal period. These patches, except those located in the occiput and nape, tend to disappear or significantly regress with time. Those in the occiput and nape tend to persist longer. Facial lesions are rare after puberty and have not been reported in adulthood. We herein report the occurrence of a salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum of a Chinese adult. With the reporting of this case, it is hoped that similar cases will be forthcoming. Familiarity of the existence of salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum in adulthood would allow a straight forward diagnosis to be made and unnecessary referrals to be avoided.\n\n【13】The persistent salmon patch on the face of an adult is benign and not associated with any neurocutaneous syndrome or underlying vascular abnormality. The color of the lesion can be ameliorated with laser therapy if cosmesis is a concern.\n\n【14】#### 4\\.

{"seq_id": "4b7528be-643d-4957-9186-71017567f6be", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Muscle involvement represents a well-recognized but rare manifestation of amyloidosis. Here, we report a 40-year-old female who presented with muscle weakness, musculoskeletal pain, and proteinuria, which was eventually diagnosed as myopathic amyloidosis based on muscle biopsy results. A multidisciplinary approach appears to be the cornerstone of the diagnostic work up for recognizing the unusual amyloid myopathy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In primary systemic amyloidosis, insoluble immunoglobulin light chains clump together to create amyloid fibrils. In about 90% of patients, a monoclonal protein is traceable in the urine or serum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common kind of acquired amyloidosis is immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The condition is caused following a misfolded monoclonal light chain generated by a plasma cell or B-cell clone, which has a proclivity for aggregation and tissue deposition, resulting in organ failure. Although it is primarily a systemic illness with the potential for widespread organ harm, localized deposits have been documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Muscle involvement has been rarely reported in AL amyloidosis, and amyloid myopathy is frequently misdiagnosed and delayed. Amyloid myopathy is a symptom that can occur before the diagnosis of systemic AL amyloidosis. Herein, we describe a case of a 40-year-old female who presented with proteinuria, muscle weakness, and musculoskeletal pain, which was eventually diagnosed as myopathic amyloidosis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Current Presentation\n\n【6】Our patient is a 40-year-old woman hospitalized with progressively worsening muscular weakness as her chief complaint since three months prior to hospitalization. The patient also complained of difficulties rising from a seated posture and proximal muscle pain. Shortly after that, she developed skin stiffness, tightness of the palms and soles, muscular stiffness, and pain in the left knee. In addition to worsening her existing symptoms, she presented with widespread body pain, wrist and ankle arthralgia, morning stiffness, tingling, and sole paresthesia around one month ago. Moreover, she reported discomfort in the temporomandibular joint and difficulties opening her mouth because of TMJ pain. She also complained of weight loss, night sweats, and dysphagia beginning two weeks before her admission, and these symptoms progressed in parallel with her other symptoms.\n\n【7】##### 2.2. Past Medical History\n\n【8】Her problem started about three years ago when she was found to have mild hematuria and proteinuria on routine examinations. At that time, proteinuria was mild, and the initial laboratory tests such as fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, hepatitis B and C serology, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), C3, C4, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were all unremarkable. However, due to an increase in proteinuria and a kidney biopsy demonstrating focal mild mesangial proliferation but negative immunofluorescent results, prednisolone and cyclosporine were administered. The patient was then closely followed by a nephrologist. During that time (around one and a half year before current hospitalization), serum protein electrophoresis was requested which demonstrated albumin: 68.4% (normal: 55.8–66.1%), alpha one: 4.6 (normal: 2.9–4.9), alpha 2: 9.6 (normal: 7.1–11.8), beta 1: 4.8 (normal: 4.7–7.2), beta 2: 4.1 (normal: 3.2–6.5), gamma: 8.5 (normal: 11.1–18.8), total protein: 6.9 g/dl, and A/G ratio: 2.16. Urine electrophoresis demonstrated normal range of protein factors. Since regular urine protein measurements had a downward trend, cyclosporine was discontinued, and prednisolone dosage was slowly tapered to 5 mg daily. Other medical history included peptic ulcer disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hypothyroidism, controlled with levothyroxine and proton-pump inhibitors.\n\n【9】##### 2.3. Physical Examination\n\n【10】Physical examination showed normal vital signs. Macroglossia and lateral tongue scalloping were noted while the patient was unable to protrude her tongue 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. The findings of extremity examination consisted of fascia hardening of soles and palms, sclerodactyly 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>, arthritis of both wrists and right ankle, lower extremity pitting edema, and muscle stiffness which was particularly evident in biceps and triceps. Furthermore, flexion contracture of knees 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>, elbows, shoulders, and hip was found. Even though the muscle power was 5/5 in all extremities, the squatting test was impaired. There were no signs of neuropathy in physical examination.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Macroglossia and lateral scalloping of the tongue, (b) flexion contracture of the knee joint, and (c) skin stiffness of palms and sclerodactyly.</u>\n\n【12】##### 2.4. Investigations\n\n【13】Given that the patient had proteinuria, a nephrologist requested laboratory tests, including fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, hepatitis B and C serology, ANA, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, anti-GBM, and ANCA, which were all normal. All kidney function tests were unremarkable; however, previous kidney biopsy showed focal mild mesangial proliferation. In addition, the immunofluorescent study of kidney tissue was negative for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, C1q, fibrinogen, kappa, and lambda. Due to the recent addition of proximal muscle weakness, skin thickening, and arthralgia to the preexisting proteinuria, she was hospitalized, and additional laboratory tests regarding the diagnosis of myositis due to connective tissue diseases were requested, with all serological results being negative. Myopathy immunologic panel testing, scleroderma-related antibodies, and thyroid function test also demonstrated normal results. Furthermore, muscle enzyme results, including lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, and aldolase, were unremarkable. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocity (EMG-NCV) study suggested a mild myopathic process. For bilateral thigh and arms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed widespread perimuscular fluid and edema with concomitant subcutaneous fluid around muscles, as well as grade 1-2 fatty changes in all pelvis and leg and arm muscles along with mild to moderate intramuscular edema 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a)–2(d))</u>. Another finding of upper extremity MRI was bilaterally diffuse subcutaneous fat thickening 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a)–3(d))</u>. There was no evidence of bone lesions.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 (a and b): MRI of both legs; T1W (a) and fluid sensitive fat sat (b) sequences; perimuscular and fascial edema (curved arrow) and intra muscular edema (arrow) within gastrocnemius muscles; (c and d): MRI of both thighs T1W (c) and fluid sensitive fat sat (d) sequences; perimuscular and fascial edema (arrow) more in anterior compartment.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 MRI of right arm T1W (a) and fat sat (b) and (c)-(d) MRI of left shoulder T1W (c) and fat sat (d) sequences. Note to the diffuse perimuscular and fascial edema more along the latissimus dorsi and rotator cuff muscles .</u>\n\n【16】Given the concurrent occurrence of macroglossia and proteinuria, amyloidosis was not an unlikely diagnosis at the time. However, the likelihood of amyloidosis caused by an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia increased when the patient’s laboratory results revealed high calcium levels, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and anemia. Serum electrophoresis measurements were alpha 1: 7.4%, alpha 2: 14.9%, beta 1: 5.4%, beta 2: 4.7%, and gamma: 7.9%; however, in serum immune typing electrophoresis, despite markedly decreased free kappa to free lambda ratio, no obvious monoclonal band was detected. The urine electrophoresis pattern was in agreement with a mixed tubular and nonselective glomerular proteinuria. Moreover, urine immune fixation electrophoresis showed two precipitant lines with lambda and kappa. In revaluation of previous kidney core needle biopsy slides, no amyloid deposit on light microscopy was identified. Kidney biopsy revealed no evidence of amyloid deposit within the glomeruli and in the wall of tubules and blood vessels based on H&E staining. Abdominal wall fat biopsy showed no significant pathologic changes, and Congo red staining was negative for amyloid deposition.\n\n【17】In order to establish the diagnosis of plasma cell dyscrasia, a bone marrow sample and histologic examination demonstrated the replacement of marrow spaces by sheets of plasmacytoid cells. The majority of cells were positive for CD138 with lambda light chain restriction . Biopsies were taken from the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle and its fascia to back up the diagnosis. The histologic exam revealed skeletal muscle fibers with variation in size and degenerative/regenerative changes. Vascular structures showed thickening of the wall with deposition of hyalinized eosinophilic material. Also, endomysial and perimysial connective tissue was expanded with foci of deposition of the same material, which was confirmed to be amyloid by Congo red staining . The findings were consistent with amyloid myopathy. As a result, the diagnosis of amyloidosis due to underlying plasma cell dyscrasia with lambda light chain restriction was made. Given the probable involvement of several organs by amyloidosis, we performed further investigations. Except for a grade 1 diastolic dysfunction, cardiac transthoracic echocardiography was normal. Gastroesophageal endoscopy showed esophagitis and gastric ulcer, which were benign according to tissue diagnosis. The CT scans of the abdomen, pelvis, chest, and liver function tests were likewise normal. Neck, arm, and thigh MRI evaluations were similar to previous report and demonstrated widespread perimuscular fluid and edema with concomitant subcutaneous fluid around muscles, as well as grade 1-2 fatty changes of muscles and mild to moderate intramuscular edema.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Bone marrow shows sheets of plasmacytoid cells.

Treatment and Follow-Up\n\n【21】The patient was referred to the hematology clinic, where chemotherapy regimen consisting of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone was commenced. She also received an autologous bone marrow transplant one year after her diagnosis. Since receiving the transplant around eight months ago, the patient’s muscle pain and proteinuria have considerably improved but has remaining difficulties in rising from a seated position and mouth opening.\n\n【22】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【23】Lubarsch reported muscle involvement in amyloid in a patient in 1929, and the patient had both interstitial and vascular deposits in the heart and skeletal muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Despite this, even in individuals with a known dysproteinemia, amyloidosis remains an uncommon cause of myopathy. In a recent study of 3434 AL amyloidosis patients, 1.5% showed a positive amyloid deposition in muscle biopsy, in which 11 (22%) had amyloid muscle involvement. Myalgia, muscle weakness, macroglossia, jaw claudication, dysphagia, skeletal pseudohypertrophy, and hoarseness are common symptoms in individuals with amyloid myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Our patient had a gradual lower-limb muscular weakness, as well as jaw claudication. Our report was similar to a report by Accardi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> which reported progressive lower-limb muscle weakness with discomfort and stiffness in the hips and shoulders, as well as jaw claudication, without any biochemical markers of muscle involvement. In their report, based on amyloid deposits in the salivary gland, the final diagnosis was considered as systemic AL amyloidosis along with myopathic involvement. However, because no other symptoms or indicators of systemic AL amyloidosis involvement, such as cardiac failure or renal proteinuria, were evident, the myopathy remained the lone clinical presentation of the disease. This was also supported in a study by Liewluck and Milone among AL amyloidosis muscle involvement patients, with 70% presenting with only myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Among specific clinical aspects, including less frequent CPK elevation and earlier age at onset, AL-systemic amyloidosis-associated myopathy diverges from pure isolated amyloid myopathy induced by other amyloidogenic protein subtypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Isolated amyloid myopathy is most commonly caused by anoctaminopathy-5 and can be observed in 27% of cases of amyloid myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Detection of systemic involvement in amyloid myopathy may be facilitated with laboratory, clinical, and pathological features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In isolated amyloid myopathy, patients are younger and have higher CK, as expected since the main causes are genetic such as dysferlinopathy and anoctaminopathy. However, in AL-systemic amyloidosis, patients are older with normal or slightly increased CK (<2.5 × upper limit). Our patient demonstrated weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, arthropathy, jaw claudication, kidney involvement, macroglossia, and muscle involvement with normal CK levels, which based on the multisystemic involvement, suggests primary AL-systemic amyloidosis.\n\n【24】The duration between the beginning of the first muscular sign and the diagnosis of amyloidosis in this patient was three months. The median period from the initial illness signs to diagnosis was 23 months in a study among AL amyloidosis patients with positive muscle biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Dissimilar to other amyloid proteins, amyloid deposition in cases of AL amyloidosis can affect various organs, and distinct criteria for evaluation of organ involvement have been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. When amyloid accumulation and the consequent organ damage occur primarily in a less frequent place, including the striated muscle, the diagnostic pitfall may be especially relevant. However, diagnosis delay in amyloidosis is common, as evidenced by a recent patient experience study that found that 37.1% of patients acquired the proper diagnostic formulation during their one year follow-up from their onset of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The preliminary muscle biopsy failed in detecting amyloid accumulation in 19 of the 79 individuals studied by Chapin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This was owing to a variety of factors, including a “random” biopsy not involving that specific muscle area or the lack of Congo staining 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Muchtar et al. observed that a diverse muscle disorder was identified in roughly 40% of the cases prior to the histological review 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, which is consistent with this observation. The hazard of disease exacerbation increases through delay in diagnosis, especially with cardiac involvement, which regulates the prognosis and stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14–16\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Based on previous reports, three basic clinical presenting types of amyloid myopathy have been documented in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 12, 17\\]</u>. The first group has skeletal pseudohypertrophy with palpable nodules in muscles and an abnormal “wood-like” consistency, which is typically linked with macroglossia. Patients in the second category have muscle weakness, especially proximal, possibly accompanied by atrophy but no other symptoms of amyloid tissue accumulation. Since the diagnosis is challenging and should consider all probable differential diagnoses of myopathy, the “atrophic type” poses a clinical problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. A mixed clinical phenotype is the third group.\n\n【27】Claudication was observed in our study and also four of 12 patients in a report by Gertz and Kyle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> and has previously been linked to amyloid myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. It is caused by amyloid accumulation in the bloodstream, which leads to ischemia and occlusion of tiny blood arteries. In the past, many individuals were misdiagnosed as having giant cell arteritis and treated with heavy doses of corticosteroids.\n\n【28】Muscle fiber damage is a poorly understood pathophysiological process. Fibril deposition is routinely detected on perimysial and endomysial arteries in muscle amyloidosis, as in our instance, suggesting prolonged ischemia resulting from endothelial injury as a plausible cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Denervation atrophy and also necrotic fibers with regeneration signals are less commonly documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 12\\]</u>. Delaporte et al. found a rise in the synthesis of protein and also cell fusion of human myoblasts in culture following exposure to pure kappa chain serum from a case of muscular pseudohypertrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The large interpatient diversity in protein structure and tissue tropism, previously discovered in amyloid proteins produced from similar variable light chain gene, is among the noteworthy features of AL amyloidosis. The specificity along with the kind of organ damage can be dramatically influenced by a small alteration in the amino acid sequence acquired during hypersomatic mutation of immunoglobulin genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【29】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【30】We presented a case of primary systemic amyloidosis with multisystemic involvement. A multidisciplinary approach appears to be the foundation of the diagnostic work up for recognizing unusual amyloid myopathy. Muscle biopsy, identification of fibril type, confirmation of amyloid deposition, assessment of underlying amyloidogenic condition, and assessment of the severity and amount of amyloidotic organ involvement are all essential steps in diagnosing and staging this disorder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Sellar tuberculomas are extremely rare lesions with nonspecific clinical manifestations. The tuberculous infection of the pituitary gland and sellar region is characterized by the presence of an acute or chronic inflammatory reaction and may occur in the absence of systemic tuberculosis. The diagnosis is difficult prior to the surgery. An adequate diagnostic and antituberculous drugs usually result in a good outcome. Clinical Presentation. We report four cases of sellar tuberculoma, 3/1 female/male, age range: 50–57 years. All patients had visual disturbances and low levels of cortisol. Conclusion. The clinical diagnosis of sellar tuberculoma is a challenge and should be suspected when a sellar lesion shows abnormal enhancement pattern and stalk involvement, and absence of signal suppression in FLAIR.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Tuberculoma of the central nervous system can occur at any site in any age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. They represent 0.15%–4% of intracranial space occupying lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>; their most frequent location are the cerebrum and cerebellum, less frequent are the brain stem, basal ganglia, and thalamus. However, the sellar localization of a tuberculoma is extremely rare even in postmortem examination. They may occur in the absence of systemic tuberculosis. Tuberculomas of the sellar and suprasellar region comprise 1% of all intracranial tuberculomas; 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> a review of the literature reveals only 67 cases reported  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–37\\]</u>. This entity represents a diagnostic challenge that needs to be solved by clinical, imaging, and histological analysis. Histological examination shows granulomas with central caseous necrosis. The differential diagnoses of intrasellar lesions include: adenoma, cyst of Rathke’s pouch, craniopharyngioma, glioma of the optic chiasm or hypothalamus, meningioma, germ cell tumor, hamartoma, lipoma, dermoid or epidermoid cyst, metastasis; and granulomatous entities like lymphocytic hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, or Langerhans’ histiocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.

General physical examination was normal. She was alert, the visual acuity in the right eye was 20/200, in the left was limited to eye-counting fingers because of cataract, color vision 0/8 bilateral, optic nerve bilateral pallor, bilateral islands of nasal vision, and endocrine investigation disclosed low levels of cortisol. CT scan of the pituitary region showed an intrasellar heterogeneous mass with peripheral enhancement. Preoperative MRI was not available. Prior to surgery the diagnosis was pituitary adenoma versus inflammatory disease. The patient underwent pterional surgery of the pituitary region. Histology revealed central caseous necrosis with lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate, extensive fibrosis, and Langhans multinucleated giant cells with epithelioid cells. An MRI two months later showed persistence of intra- and suprasellar inflammatory lesion that reached the chiasm and involved the stalk . Diagnosis of sellar tuberculoma was made; the patient received isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and steroids during eight months.

Results\n\n【20】Age range of patients was 50–67 years, mean: 58 years; male/female ratio was 1 : 3. The predominant clinical features were headache and impaired visual acuity; clinical results are summarized on Table 1.\n\n【21】According to the extension three types of lesion were seen.\n\n【22】Two patients presented sellar and suprasellar masses without obstructive hydrocephalus, both patients presented visual impairment: one with bilateral optic atrophy and the other with papilloedema. Systemic manifestations of tuberculosis were not found. One patient had retrosellar extension, brain stem compression, and hydrocephalus with raised pressure manifestations (right third nerve palsy and right upper motor neuron); he also had pachymeningitis with meningism. One patient presented severe headache and palsy of right third and fourth nerves and decreased visual acuity.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【24】Tuberculoma is defined as a well-circumscribed mass composed of granulomatous chronic inflammatory tissue that may occur in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brain stem, or perimeningeal spaces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. They account for 0.15% to 4% of intracranial space-occupying lesions with geographical variations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In India, sellar and suprasellar tuberculomas represent 1% of all intracranial tuberculomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. We found 27 cases of intracranial tuberculomas in the registers of the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery of Mexico since 1999 to 2009, the localization was sellar in four of them (14%) higher than reported in similar studies . The pathway for spreading mycobacterium tuberculosis to this region is unclear; either haematogenous spreading or contiguous extension from a local tuberculous infection of the paranasal sinuses has been proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. In some patients the primary focus cannot be demonstrated. From the cases reported here, one patient had antecedent of tuberculous meningitis and another had pulmonary infection. Headache is a common symptom; throbbing severe headache was present in 2 patients. All patients had visual disturbances as affection of visual fields, visual acuity, diplopia, mydriasis, or blurred vision, in contrast with other reports in which visual disturbances were present only in about 50% of cases. One patient had fever, meningism, and Weber syndrome at onset due to a mass effect on the brain stem; this syndrome had not been previously reported in cases of sellar tuberculoma.\n\n【25】Similar reports found anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies or central diabetes insipidus at onset, hypogonadism secondary to low levels of GH, FSH/LH, TSH, and ACTH deficiencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. All our cases with endocrine system investigation () disclosed a decrease of cortisol levels; one patient had deficiency of the thyrotrophic hormone. Endocrinology profile was not made in one patient. A previous review revealed that 60% of patients had complete anterior panhypopituitarism and 28% had central diabetes insipidus as initial presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. Another frequent finding is raised prolactin levels due to pituitary stalk effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Pituitary tuberculosis may present a diagnostic dilemma because it is difficult to differentiate inflammatory lesions from a pituitary adenoma. MRI is the chosen imaging modality to establish the differential diagnosis. Thickening and nodularity of the pituitary stalk are considered to be a sign of pituitary tuberculoma; however, this finding is nonspecific as it is also seen in other inflammatory conditions like sarcoidosis, syphilis, and idiopathic hypophysitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 42, 43\\]</u>. This finding was present only in one patient (Case  2) 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. The classical imaging of brain tuberculomas is multiple coalescing contrast-enhancing lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. We also found this pattern only in one patient (Case  4). T1-weighted image usually are hypointense; nevertheless, they can also be hyperintense too due a high protein content 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Three of four cases were isointense on T1-weighted image. The literature described that the lesions may appear hyperintense on T2-weighted image or may have an hyperintense center surrounded by a hypointense rim with peripheral ring enhancement of the lesion and enhancement of the adjacent dura and basal cistern. Nonenhancement areas corresponded to tuberculoma caseation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. On T2-weighted images we observed a major hyperintense component in three cases (75%), similar to other reports; we found peripheral ring enhancement in three cases (75%), whereas in one case generalized slightly enhancement was seen. On T2-FLAIR images all lesions were hyperintense; this finding could be useful for the differential diagnosis with other inflammatory lesions.\n\n【27】The histopathological characteristic of tuberculosis is ill-defined caseating granulomas with giant cells. Other causes of granulomatous inflammation of the pituitary are lymphocytic hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, and Langherhan’s histiocytosis and caseating giant cell granulomata 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The diagnosis requires confirmation by acid fast Bacilli and chain polymerase reaction for detection of mycobacterial DNA; however, these studies are not routinely done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. In our cases the histological studies revealed chronic inflammatory lesions of granulomatous type in different phases, leading to different degrees of destruction and necrosis of the pituitary gland.\n\n【28】The presence of vasculitis is a serious consequence of tuberculous meningitis, which can result in infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. This finding was evident in one of our cases. Endocrinological study and Ziehl Neelsen staining together with imaging and histology can confirm the diagnosis. In one patient, the culture of brain biopsy sample on Lowenstein-Jensen medium was required to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【29】Antituberculous therapy is mandatory in sellar tuberculosis; most cases have appropriate response. One patient could not be followed. Three cases had resolution of pituitary tuberculoma in follow-up studies (12–24 months). There is no consensus regarding the type of antitubercular regimen and duration of the treatment in pituitary tuberculoma.\n\n【30】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】In the present study this entity was more frequent than previously reported, so it should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of sellar lesions. Clinically, it behaves like any sellar lesion with visual manifestations and endocrine alteration. Sellar tuberculoma should be suspected when a sellar lesion shows abnormal enhancement pattern and stalk involvement; peripheral enhancement and absence of signal suppression in FLAIR are clues to the imaging diagnosis. Long-term chemotherapy with antituberculous drugs usually results in a good outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In this report, we present a 27-year-old male patient with a mediastinal bronchogenic cyst together with clinical presentation and management of the pathology.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cystic lesions may occur in the mediastinum; however, they are rare. They can have pericardial, enteric origin or bronchogenic origin in most of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Usually the patients are asymptomatic, and when the lesion leads to symptoms, since it was first reported in 1959 by Meyer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, the standard therapy is the resection of cyst. The literature seldom reveals reports of intrapericardial bronchogenic cysts.\n\n【4】Here, we report clinical presentation and management of a mediastinal bronchogenic cyst in a 27-year-old patient.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】The patient was a 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and swelling of his face and neck when he lay down. He complained of recent faint attacks in the last few weeks. Physical examination, chest radiography, and blood analysis were found to be normal. An echocardiography showed mild diastolic dysfunction and a cysts-like structure inside the pericardial cavity. The computerized tomography (CT) confirmed 8 × 7 cm cystic structure situated between the aortic arch and right pulmonary artery . We decided to surgically remove the mass lesion to treat myocardial diastolic dysfunction and for an accurate histopathologic diagnosis after the consent of the patient.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The computerized tomography of the patient showing 8 × 7 cm cystic structure situated above the right ventricle between the aortic arch and right pulmonary artery.</u>\n\n【8】Following standard median sternotomy, the pericardium was opened and 8 × 7 cm in diameter cystic structure was detected . After mobilizing the cyst from the right atrium, aorta, and the right pulmonary artery, it could be en bloc resected . The cyst was removed from the operating table to another table and cut. Yellow, jelly-like liquid was drained. Specimens for microbiology and histopatologic examination were obtained. A frozen section excluded malignancy and indicated a benign cystic lesion of bronchogenic origin. The cavity left after the removal of the cyst was covered with pericardium and the operation was finished uneventfully.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Perioperative view of the cyst.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Resected cystic lesion.</u>\n\n【11】The patient was taken to the intensive care unit and weaned off mechanic ventilation in 6 hours. He was taken to the ward next day and discharged from the hospital on the postoperative 5th day. Microbiologic examination ended sterile and bronchogenic cyst diagnosis was confirmed with detailed histopathologic examination. The patient is followed regularly for more than 1 year at the outpatient clinic, and he was found to be asymptomatic throughout the followup period.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Bronchogenic cysts are rare congenital lesions. They emerge due to abnormal development of the foregut which develops in a blind-end, fluid-filled pouch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although they are mostly located in the mediastinum, they may also occur in the lungs, diaphragm, retroperitoneum, pericardium, thymus, and neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Within the mediastinum, they are mainly situated at the subcarinal and right paratracheal regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Cases of intrapericardial and intracardiac bronchogenic cysts are very seldom in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Limaïem et al. reported an incidence of 1 case per 42,000 patients in the North American population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Bronchogenic cysts usually do not cause symptoms and patients are mostly detected incidentally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Very rarely, nonspecific symptoms such as retrosternal chest pain, dyspnea, cough, fever, and hoarseness may be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, a huge cyst can provoke arterial compression, compression of the main bronchus and superior vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although adults with cysts are usually symptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, in children they can cause symptoms due to the compression of the adjacent structures. Clinical findings such as cardiac murmur and electrocardiographic changes are described in a few cases in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Bronchogenic cysts are sacs filled with fluid. The radiologic diagnosis may be difficult because of air-fluid level or variable protein content as in case of an infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9\\]</u>. As in our case, computerized tomography aids in preoperative diagnosis; however, differentiation between infections such as hydatid disease, a malignancy, or for the exact origin (i.e. pericardial, enteric, bronchogenic, or others) of the cyst can only be made with resection material and detailed histopathologic examination.\n\n【16】St-Georges et al. analyzed a collection of 86 resections of bronchogenic cysts. Their analysis revealed that 82% (the majority) of the patients became either symptomatic or complicated due to fistulization, ulceration, and infection in time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. McGlynn Jr. et al. reported that the cysts could even imitate an acute coronary syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Moreover, there are a few reports in the literature indicating malignancy potential of bronchogenic cysts, such as converting into large cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, bronchoalveolar carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In conclusion, due to the proximity of the vital structures, surgical treatment is an approved, useful, and safe procedure with low complication rates for the treatment of bronchogenic cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Considering the risk of complications and even malignancy, bronchogenic cysts require resection and should be performed when they are diagnosed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Some anomalies are merely benign anatomical variants, whereas some can result in myocardial ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmia. Case Presentation. We described seven cases in which all three major coronaries emerged from the right sinus of Valsalva via a single ostium and supplied the vast majority of the myocardium. A smaller branch arising from the left sinus supplied a modest quantity of myocardium in some of those few cases. These SCA variations do not exactly fit into any existing classification. It is unclear whether we need to modify previous classification systems or newer classification systems. Conclusions. SCA is divided based on its anomalous course and is usually a benign condition but it may present with cardiovascular complications. Clinicians should be aware of this entity along with the role of CT angiogram in its diagnosis and management.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Coronary anomalies are usually incidentally diagnosed during coronary angiogram (CAG), CT coronary angiogram (CCTA), or autopsy studies and affect 0.3–5.6% of the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These anomalies differ in number, location, coronary origin, and ostium orientation. A single coronary artery (SCA) is defined as “an isolated coronary artery that arises from a single coronary ostium and provides blood supply to the entire myocardium” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. They may or may not be associated with structural heart disease. According to the published literature, the prevalence of SCA in the general population is very low, ranging from 0.024 to 0.066% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. The majority of SCA are asymptomatic. However, in some cases, severe life-threatening arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or sudden cardiac death may occur, requiring medical or surgical intervention or coronary revascularisation procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】##### 1.1. Case Presentation\n\n【5】We reviewed 28,148 coronary angiograms performed at the Department of Cardiology, Kasturba Medical College and Hospital in Southern Karnataka, from 2014 to 2020 and reported 7 cases of the single coronary artery from the right sinus, including its variant, implying a prevalence of 0.025 percent in our population. We described seven cases of a single coronary artery that originated from the right sinus of Valsalva via a common ostium and supplied the majority of the myocardium.\n\n【6】###### 1.1.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 59-year-old hypertensive and diabetic female presented with a history of exertional fatigue NYHA (New York Heart Association) class II and nonanginal chest pain for the last 2 years. The electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram were normal but her treadmill test (TMT) was positive at 8 METS (metabolic equivalents) without any symptoms. The right and left sinus of Valsalva were successfully cannulated on CAG using 5F TIG (Tiger) 110 cms—OPTITORQUE® Diagnostic Catheter (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). An angiogram showed a single coronary artery (SCA) originating from a single right coronary ostium from the right sinus of Valsalva. The right coronary artery (RCA), left circumflex artery (LCX), and left anterior descending (LAD) arteries all emerged from the right coronary sinus and shared a common ostium. The right dominant coronary arterial system was observed, with the RCA continuing as the posterior descending artery (PDA), and it was normal. The LAD, LCX, and RCA were all normal 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. A branch originating from the left sinus which continued laterally over the left ventricle—likely an obtuse marginal branch. The left main coronary artery (LMCA) was not visible 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. CCTA confirmed the LAD course below the right ventricular outflow tract (subpulmonic) and then through the septum to the anterior interventricular groove, corresponding to Lipton’s class R-III-S 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(c) and 1(d))</u>. Neither SCA nor its branches had a malignant interarterial course. She experienced nonanginal chest pain, for which she was optimally treated with a statin and antihypertensive medications.

Case 2\n\n【10】A 61-year-old diabetic male presented with anginal pain and sweating for 6 hours. The ECG revealed an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction. The systemic examination was unremarkable. Troponin was elevated. CAG revealed an abnormal origin of all three major coronaries, LAD, LCX, and RCA, from the right sinus of Valsalva via a common ostium. The dominant RCA had complete thrombotic occlusion, whereas the LCX ostial and midportion had 90% stenosis. The LAD was normal 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(e))</u>. He underwent an emergency angioplasty.

Balloon angioplasty was performed to the LCX lesion with a (2 × 15 mm) predilatation balloon. TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction)—3 flow was achieved, hence LCX was not stented 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(g))</u>. CCTA revealed that all 3 major coronaries originated from the right sinus via a common ostium with an interarterial course of the LAD, corresponding to Lipton’s class R-III-B 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(h))</u>. This course was considered malignant as compression between the aorta and pulmonary artery would lead to sudden cardiac death during vigorous exercise.

Case 4\n\n【15】A 60-year-old hypertensive man presented with sudden onset of breathlessness for 1 day. There was a history of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND). A physical examination revealed a pulse rate of 140/min and a blood pressure of 190/100 mm Hg. On examination, bilateral crepitation was present. The ECG showed ST-T changes and troponin was elevated (0.331 ng/ml). An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function, trivial mitral regurgitation, and mild left ventricular hypertrophy. He was mechanically ventilated. CAG showed single-vessel disease with all 3 major coronaries originating from the right sinus via a common ostium. LAD had mild plaque 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u>. LCX ran retroaortic with ostioproximal 95% thrombotic occlusion 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(e))</u>. The dominant RCA had 60% stenosis in the midpart 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(f))</u>.

CAG was performed, which showed all 3 major coronaries LAD, LCX, and RCA arising from the right sinus via the common trunk. The dominant RCA showed 90% stenosis in the midpart. He successfully underwent PCI to the mid-RCA with a sirolimus-eluting stent. A CCTA was performed, which revealed a common trunk originating from the right coronary sinus and from which the LAD, LCX, and RCA originated 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(g))</u>. The LAD had an interarterial course between the pulmonary trunk and the aortic root with no stenosis, corresponding to Lipton’s class R-III-B 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(h))</u>. The LCX ran posteriorly between the aortic root and the left atrium—a retroaortic course with normal contrast opacification 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(g) and 2(h))</u>. The dominant RCA showed a patent RCA stent with its normal course. He was discharged on dual antiplatelets, statin, and antidiabetic medications, and he was doing well at the 1-year follow-up.\n\n【18】###### 1.1.6. Case 6\n\n【19】A 46-year-old hypertensive and hyperthyroid female presented with a history of one episode of giddiness but no syncopal attacks. She denied any other cardiac symptoms. Physical and cardiac examinations were both normal. The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy with a strain pattern and the echocardiogram showed apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without outflow obstruction with normal ejection fraction. Troponin T level was within normal limits. CAG showed an anomalous origin of the LMCA from the right sinus along with the RCA via a common ostium. The left main coronary artery crossed the aorta retroaortically and divided into the LAD and LCX branches, which supplied the respective territory 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(i))</u>. The angiographic findings were confirmed by CCTA and classified as Lipton’s class R-II-P. The RCA entered the right atrioventricular groove and continued distally as PDA in its normal course. All of the major epicardial coronaries were normal. However, smaller diagonal branch originating from the left sinus was also normal 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(j))</u>. She was advised of medical management and was doing well after a one-year follow-up.\n\n【20】###### 1.1.7. Case 7\n\n【21】A 68-year-old hypertensive male presented with complaints of weakness in the left upper limb of 1-month duration. Physical and cardiac examinations were both normal. The ECG and echocardiogram were both normal. MRI revealed a subacute infarct in the right precentral gyrus, as well as a subacute infarct in the right centrum semiovale and corona radiata. Carotid doppler showed an echogenic thrombus for a length of 2 cm in the right proximal internal carotid artery (ICA), causing near-complete occlusion. A carotid angiogram revealed 100% thrombotic occlusion of the right proximal ICA. CAG revealed that all 3 major coronaries (LAD, LCX, and RCA) originated from the right coronary cusp via a common ostium 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(k))</u>, and CCTA revealed Lipton’s class R-III-A. The LAD emerged from the right sinus, traversed the left side, and entered the anterior interventricular groove. The LAD was normal, but its diagonal branch showed 70% stenosis. The LCX emerged from the right sinus, travelled retroaortically, and then continued distally in the posterior atrioventricular groove. The dominant RCA arose from the right sinus and continued in its normal anatomical course. He was asymptomatic for his cardiac condition, so he was prescribed single antiplatelet, statin, and antihypertensive medications.\n\n【22】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【23】Coronary anomalies are rare and usually diagnosed incidentally during coronary angiography, CT coronary angiography, or autopsy studies. Its prevalence is approximately 0.3–5.6% in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Among these, the single coronary artery is a very rare condition, with an estimated prevalence of 0.024–0.066% based on a published literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. SCA is defined as “an isolated coronary artery that arises from a single coronary ostium and provides blood supply to the entire myocardium” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It may not be associated with other congenital heart diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Several classification systems for SCA had been described. The classification for SCA was introduced by Smith, Ogden and Goodyear, Lipton et al. and Shirani and Roberts, to describe the origin and course of SCA. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u> None of these classification systems are complete, but they do aid in the classification of various types of SCA. However, Lipton et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> classification system is widely used, and it was later modified by Yamanaka and Hobbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> in 1990, based on anatomical distribution, ostial location, and the course of the transverse trunk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【25】We described 7 cases of SCA (∼0.025% prevalence) in which all three major coronaries originated from the right sinus of Valsalva via a common ostium and supplied the majority of the myocardium. This type of anatomy corresponds to the R-II or R-III type of Lipton’s classification. Out of 7 cases, two cases had a branch originating from the left sinus supplying the smaller area of the myocardium. Even though there were two coronary ostia in our patient, the entire heart was essentially supplied by the right coronary system. Because these cases did not exactly correspond to any of the aforementioned classification systems, we have considered them as a variant of SCA. Except for the aberrant small branch, this anatomy correlates with Lipton’s type R-II or R-III. Even in the literature, it is unclear whether such cases should be classified as single coronary systems or not. A similar type of case was reported by Subban et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> where the RCA and LAD arose from the right sinus and the RCA continued as the LCX distally, along with a small diminutive diagonal branch from the left sinus. They had described such a case as a single coronary system as the majority of the heart was supplied by the right coronary system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. We need further data to update these classification systems to include such cases.\n\n【26】A coronary angiogram can clearly identify anomalies in 53% of cases only. CT angiography can precisely delineate anatomic abnormality, acute angle take-off, the number of Ostia, the course of the coronaries, and their relationship to the great arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. A 64-slice CT angiogram has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 96% for detecting coronary stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The majority of individuals with SCA are asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms; nevertheless, certain variants of SCA can cause angina, myocardial ischemia, syncope, and severe life-threatening arrhythmias. Sudden cardiac death can be a presenting feature if SCA courses between the pulmonary artery and the aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our 2 cases had such type of interarterial course of LAD. According to Shirani and Roberts, 15 percent of SCA cases develop angina and ischemia as a result of aberrant coronary anatomy rather than coronary artery diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Anomalous LAD originating from the right sinus can take one of four paths: septal, anterior free wall, retroaortic, or interarterial. The septal course is mostly benign and no cases of sudden cardiac death have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Although anomalous coronaries are rare, they continue to be at risk for CAD and should be treated in the same way as native coronaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Hutchins et al. showed that the abnormal tortuous course of the proximal part of anomalous coronaries is susceptible to lipid accumulation, predisposing them to increased atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Anomalous LCX from the right sinus has a higher risk of stenosis compared to normal origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Considering the wide range of anatomical presentations of SCA, a comprehensive strategy involving cardiologists and cardiac surgeons should be considered while selecting the most appropriate treatment. A severe symptomatic patient with CAD requires angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, whereas minimally symptomatic patients with no significant CAD require medical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Patients who present with syncope of unknown origin, malignant arrhythmia, or resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest due to an abnormal interarterial course are usually advised to undergo surgical management via aortocoronary bypass, coronary reimplantation, or unroofing of an intramural coronary segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Surgery is recommended if there is evidence of myocardial ischemia, even in asymptomatic patients with an interarterial course; it is also recommended for patients under 30–35 years of age, even if the stress test is negative. The risk of sudden cardiac death in elderly people declines with age and is exceedingly low, possibly due to the hardening of the aortic wall in the elderly population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In our series, 4 out of 7 patients who underwent coronary artery stenting had no symptoms on follow-up. The other 3 patients had no coronary artery disease and were followed up periodically as they were asymptomatic.\n\n【31】#### 3\\. Conclusions\n\n【32】SCA is one of the rarest coronary anomalies. It is classified based on its anomalous course. SCA is usually a benign condition but it may present with myocardial ischemia, life-threatening arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death. Clinicians and surgeons should be aware of this entity along with the role of CT angiogram in its diagnosis and management.\n\n【33】#### Abbreviations\n\n| SCA: | Single coronary artery |\n| --- | --- |\n| CTCA: | Coronary computed tomography angiography |\n| CAG: | Coronary angiogram |\n| NYHA: | New York Heart Association |\n| METS: | Metabolic equivalents |\n| TIMI: | Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction |\n| LAD: | Left anterior descending artery |\n| RCA: | Right coronary artery |\n| LCx: | Left circumflex artery |\n| LMCA: | Left main coronary artery |\n| EES: | Everolimus-eluting stent |\n| TMT: | Treadmill test |\n| ICA: | Internal carotid artery |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This article reports the case of a 43-year-old woman who, after ingesting a dose of sodium phosphate monobasic/sodium phosphate dibasic, presented a maculopapular rash on the trunk and extremities. The electrocardiogram showed ST depression in V4-V5-V6 and signs of prolonged QTc; troponin I uptake was positive. Due to presumed myocardial injury and high suspicion of coronary disease, coronary angiography was requested, which showed epicardial coronary arteries, without angiographically significant stenosis, thus confirming the presence of KS secondary to the ingestion of a laxative.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Kounis syndrome (KS) is defined as an acute coronary syndrome that presents as unstable angina that may be secondary to vasospastic or nonvasospastic etiology, and even as a manifestation of acute myocardial infarction, triggered by the release of inflammatory mediators after allergic aggression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It has been reported that there are three types of KS associated with the same number of different pathophysiological processes derived from the activation and degranulation of mast cells, which lead to the release of powerful inflammatory mediators. Thus, type I is a coronary spasm in patients with normal or near-normal coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1,2\\]</u>; established or pre-existing coronary artery disease in which inflammation leads to coronary vasospasm or plaque rupture (type II); or in-stent thrombosis and restenosis (type III) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Case Report\n\n【5】A 43-year-old female patient was referred to a high-complexity hospital for the suspected coronary syndrome. The patient reported a history of chronic low back pain and cholelithiasis, waiting for scheduling and management by general surgery on an outpatient basis.\n\n【6】In the initial care hospital and due to her low back pain, a simple X-ray of the total spine was sent and a laxative preparation was ordered for this procedure. One dose of sodium phosphate monobasic/sodium phosphate dibasic (Travad oral®) was administered. Fifteen minutes after ingestion, the patient presented a maculopapular rash on the trunk and extremities, an event that later became generalized; this situation was associated with dyspnea and use of accessory muscles, in addition to diarrheal stools on multiple occasions. Subsequently, the patient consults again and was assessed in the emergency room, where the following vital signs were found: blood pressure 88/64 mm Hg, heart rate 122 bpm, respiratory rate 32, and oxygen saturation 88–89%. It was then interpreted as anaphylaxis, for which management was started with IM adrenaline until a total dose of 3 mg was reached. With this, improvement in blood pressure figures and control of skin and gastrointestinal symptoms were obtained.\n\n【7】During her observation in the emergency department, the patient reported a sensation of chest discomfort, epigastric pain, and abdominal pain (after the administration of adrenaline); therefore, this was considered as a diagnostic challenge/differential. It was decided to perform an electrocardiogram in which ST depression was interpreted in V4-V5-V6 . Troponin I (ultrasensitive) was also taken, which was positive for the cutoff point (4.8 ng/ml; cutoff up to 0.3 ng/ml). Management was then started with aspirin 300 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, furosemide 40 mg every 8 hours intravenously (IV), isosorbide dinitrate in case of angina, methylprednisolone 50 mg every 8 hours IV, and enoxaparin 60 mg subcutaneously every 24 hours.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Initial electrocardiogram of the referral site.

Sinus rhythm and extension of ischemia to the posterior face of the heart is ruled out.</u>\n\n【10】Subsequently, a referral was made to a hospital with a higher level of complexity due to a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, with Killip III classification, due to crepitus and radiological signs of acute pulmonary edema. Upon her admission, there was no clear clinical evidence of angina or chest pain, she denied paroxysmal dyspnea, denied bendopnea, denied extremities edema, denied other symptoms, and reported improvement of the rash. She presented the following vital signs at that time: blood pressure 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate 78 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate 18 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. On physical examination, no use of accessory muscles, no respiratory effort, rhythmic heart sounds, and no presence of heart murmurs were observed. An electrocardiogram was taken, which reported sinus rhythm, heart rate of 79 bpm, QTc 521, QRS 70, PR 154, and prominent precordial T waves .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Initial electrocardiogram in a high-complexity hospital. Sinus rhythm, heart rate 75 bpm, QTc 521, QRS 70, PR 154, and prominent precordial T waves.</u>\n\n【12】With the above, and due to signs of prolonged QTc, magnesium sulfate was administered, 1 gram every 8 hours IV. Moreover, due to suspicion of a coronary syndrome, high-sensitivity troponin (hs-cTN) was requested again, presenting a value of 10854, that is, positive. Furthermore, leukocytes 16,200/ul, neutrophils 78.9%, hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL, platelets 259,000/ml, INR (international normalized ratio) 1.0, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, magnesium 1.8 mg/dL, sodium 140 mmol/L, nitrogen urea 13.4, creatinine 0.7, alanine aminotransferase 16 IU/L, and aspartate aminotransferase 55 IU/L.\n\n【13】Due to electrocardiographic findings and positive troponin (biomarker), a transthoracic echocardiogram was requested , reporting a normal-sized left ventricle, moderate hypokinesia of the middle segment of the anterior and lateral wall, normal contractility of the rest of the segments, LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) 55%, no diastolic dysfunction, the right ventricle of normal size and systolic function, TAPSE (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion): 21 mm, nonquantifiable pulmonary systolic pressure, valvular apparatus without relevant alterations, size atria normal, pericardium and great vessels without relevant alterations, IS/IVS without defects or shunts, no intracavitary thrombi, and normal in the rest of the study. Due to presumed myocardial injury and high suspicion of coronary artery disease, coronary angiography was requested, which showed epicardial coronary arteries, without angiographically significant stenosis , thus confirming the presence of Kounis syndrome. The patient was discharged 3 days after admission, asymptomatic, without complications, with outpatient cardiology follow-up, and secondary cardiovascular prevention started (acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly).\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Transthoracic echocardiogram.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Coronary arteriography.</u>\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】The cardiovascular system can be highly compromised in the presence of allergic reactions. This is how a dangerous and serious cardiac manifestation such as KS can occur, which can include potential symptoms such as hypotension, arrhythmias, and ventricular dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>. Inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, macrophages, and mast cells, play a relevant role in hypersensitivity reactions. They start an inflammatory cascade through the release of leukotrienes, thromboxane, IgE, tryptase, histamine, and cytokines, which act on different organic systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. At the coronary level, histamine can cause vasoconstriction, which seems to be the main pathophysiological mechanism in KS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【18】In the present case, a KS secondary to the administration of a laxative is described. Although the literature reports KS secondary to drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2,3\\]</u>, especially antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, there is no known report related to this type of medication. However, the clinical manifestations related to KS were similar to those presented in the patient reported in this case. Chest pain has been reported to be the most common sign, followed by allergy-related symptoms (pruritus and edema) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite this, patients admitted to the emergency department without clear cardiac symptoms have been documented, but that the search for etiology and phenomena of cardiac ischemia are documented either due to changes in the electrocardiogram or due to elevation of biomarkers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>; the presentation of patients with the acute coronary syndrome as the only manifestation of a hypersensitivity reaction is less frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Due to this wide range of symptomatologic variants and the absence of cardiac risk factors, KS remains underdiagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Different electrocardiographic patterns associated with KS are presented in the literature, including ST-segment elevation in the anterior and inferior face of the electrocardiogram, followed by repolarization disorders, heart block, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular ectopy rhythms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Allergy studies include the measurement of serum levels of tryptase, histamine, immunoglobulin E, complement levels, and eosinophil count. However, these studies are not as widely available. Therefore, among all patients with angina and a suspected allergy component, and the coronary angiography is normal, or indicates that there are no coronary arteries with lesions, and the KS picture is more suggestive. Troponin I usually presents elevation in 7–10% of patients with anaphylaxis, without having such a high range, as in patients with coronary syndrome due to atherothrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Regarding the management of KS, a great versatility between cases has been described, possibly due to the absence of predetermined algorithms. However, the recommended therapy consists of concomitant management of myocardial ischemia and allergic reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The use of nitrates should be considered as long as the patient does not present some degree of hypotension, improving the signs and symptoms of vasospasm. It is not clear the use of acetylsalicylic acid as well as inhibitors of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex in KS; however, until the active coronary disease has been ruled out, it should be recommended if the initial clinical picture is more in favor of an acute coronary syndrome. The use of other medications such as adrenaline, steroids, and antihistamines is recommended under the pretext of the distributive shock that these patients present, as long as they are indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Finally, it is important to keep in mind that hypersensitivity reactions, regardless of the primary trigger, can be complicated by the acute coronary syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 81-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our department for several weeks of symptoms such as chills, fever, malaise, fatigue, and recurrent tumble despite antibiotic therapy. She was treated prior to admission for approximately two weeks with antibiotics in another hospital. The patient had an important abdominal surgery due to gastric carcinoma three months prior to admission. Gastrectomy, lymphadenectomy, and esophageal stent because of esophageal anastomosis insufficiency were performed during this surgery. The patient had initially presented with chills and recurrent tumble at the family doctor and was at this time admitted in another hospital. With increasing inflammation parameters despite antibiotic therapy and recurrent fever, the medication was changed from amoxicillin to piperacillin/tazobactam on admission. Three independent sets of peripheral blood cultures were obtained before the start of changed antibiotic. All three sets depicted Lactobacillus species. The patient denied ingesting any probiotics. We suspected endocarditis because of bacteremia with Lactobacillus, recurrent symptoms with worsening of condition, and persistent infection despite antibiotic. On admission, she was febrile to 38.3°C, somnolent, complaining of generalized fatigue and malaise. Her heart rate was 85 bpm, and her blood pressure was 110/75 mmHg. Clinical examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur loudest at the apex such as no painful haemorrhagic spots (Janeway lesion) on all fingertips of the left hand. Lung auscultation and chest X-ray showed no anomaly. Laboratory studies showed a normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin: 9.0 g/dl; MCV: 85.0 fl), a regular white blood cell count (8.960/µl), reduced platelet count (123.000/µl), elevated C-reactive protein (12.6 mg/dl), and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (310 U/l). We performed a transesophageal echocardiogram for further diagnosis. It showed degenerative changes of the mitral valve with moderate regurgitation as well as small endocarditis vegetation (Figures 1(a) and 1(b) Pronounced vegetation of the mitral valve could not be seen. The susceptibility testing showed that the isolate was resistant to vancomycin. After application of the Duke criteria (one major criterion and three minor criteria were found) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> in combination with the clinical condition, the diagnosis of endocarditis was more likely. The major criterion was the vegetation and degenerative changes of the mitral valve, and the minor criteria were the three positive blood cultures with Lactobacillus species, fever over 38.0°C, and the Janeway lesion found on the left hand. We started an intravenous antibiotic therapy with ampicillin (2 g with six administrations per day) combined with gentamicin (with maximum 80 mg per day) for six weeks. The CT scan on admission revealed subcapsular fluid formation of the spleen . During antibiotic therapy, we performed a PET/CT scan to localize potential inflammatory foci due to embolic complication. Florid inflammatory processes were found in several locations within the spleen 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a) and 3(b))</u>. This result was interpreted as peripheral embolization due to endocarditis. We discussed the result of the PET/CT scan with our abdominal/visceral surgeons. They decided upon an operational treatment of the splenic abscesses.

The oncologic surgery of a proximal femur osteosarcoma affecting the hip joint can be very challenging. We present an 8-year-old boy with a 5-month history of right hip pain. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a lytic lesion of the proximal femur extending 13 cm to the diaphysis. Histological evaluation was consistent with high-grade osteoblastic osteosarcoma. After completing chemotherapy we performed an extra-articular resection of the hip. Reconstruction was accomplished by reimplanting the acetabulum after irradiation and modular proximal femur megaprosthesis. Endoprosthetic reconstruction following proximal femur resection is a good treatment alternative achieving good postoperative function. Extra-articular resection of the hip using a periacetabular osteotomy technique enabled us to achieve wide margins and leave an intact posterior column to optimize acetabular reconstruction stability. Extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation is a valuable treatment option in a situation such as this where allograft geometric fit is a priority. We conclude that an extra-articular resection of the hip, followed by reconstruction with an extracorporeally irradiated acetabulum and a proximal femur modular megaprosthesis, is a useful combined treatment option for malignant lesions involving the hip joint, especially in paediatric patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone, with an incidence of 2.4% among childhood cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Osteosarcoma commonly occurs in the long bones, near the metaphyseal growth plates; the femur is the most frequently involved bone. Articular cartilage acts as a relative barrier to tumor spread, and extension into the hip joint is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The management of a proximal femur malignant lesion with intra-articular involvement is challenging. The need for adequate excision margins and the anatomical complexity of the pelvis mean that reconstruction procedures are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, as well as poor functional outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】We present an unreported case of proximal femur osteosarcoma with intra-articular involvement, treated with extra-articular resection of the hip, reconstructed with an irradiated acetabulum structural autograft and proximal femur modular megaprosthesis replacement.\n\n【6】#### 2\\.

After two months of follow-up without clinical or radiological signs of fracture healing, the patient was referred to our centre. Plain radiographs of the pelvis, hip, and proximal femur showed mixed osteolytic and sclerotic areas at the right proximal femur and an unhealed femoral neck fracture fixed with two K wires 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Suspecting a primary bone tumor, an open biopsy was performed and the K wires were removed. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a proximal femur lesion extending distally 13 cm, with a surrounding soft-tissue mass. MRI also showed joint effusion, though there was no evidence of acetabular extension 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. Histological evaluation was consistent with high-grade osteoblastic osteosarcoma. A chest CT scan and a bone scintigraphy did not show metastasis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the Erasmus 1 Trial protocol (Methotrexate, Adriamycin, and Cisplatin) was initiated and completed without incident.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) Plain radiographs of the pelvis, hip, and proximal femur showing mixed osteolytic and sclerotic areas in the right proximal femur and an unhealed femoral neck fracture fixed with two K wires.

The iliac vessels and the femoral and sciatic nerves were exposed and mobilized. The intrapelvic portion of the psoas muscle was released and the gluteus maximus muscle was detached from the iliotibial band and femur. The external rotators of the hips were transected near their origins, and the vastus intermedius and lateralis were transected at the level of the femoral osteotomy.\n\n【10】A femoral osteotomy was made 16 cm distally from the tip of the greater trochanter, giving 3 cm of wide margin. The insertions of the adductors were transected from the proximal femur, followed by release of the gluteus medius and minimus. Subsequently an en bloc extra-articular resection of the acetabulum was performed, following the standard steps in a Bernese periacetabular osteotomy; the resected specimen was then transferred to a separate sterile trolley and moved away from the main operative field to avoid any contamination. Under aseptic precautions, a capsulectomy was made through the acetabulum rim, and samples of articular fluid and the proximal femur were sent for histological examination. Head size was measured for bipolar reconstruction. The acetabulum was placed in a sterile container and sent to the radiotherapy department for extracorporeal irradiation . The acetabulum segment, enclosed in a sterile pack, was irradiated to a dose of 50 Gy/1 fraction. Meanwhile we implanted a bipolar femoral modular megaprosthesis (Biomet OSS Compress) for proximal femoral reconstruction. Upon return to the operating room, the excised acetabulum was reimplanted and fixed with two reconstruction plates, achieving perfect geometric anatomic fit.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Following the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy, an en bloc extra-articular resection of the acetabulum was performed; the resected specimen was then transferred to a separate sterile trolley.

Microscopic tumor implantations were seen at the distal capsular insertions. Articular fluid cytology showed no evidence of tumor cells.\n\n【13】Postoperatively the patient was immobilized with a spica cast for a period of 12 weeks. Three weeks after the index procedure the patient developed a superficial wound dehiscence which required aggressive surgical debridement and lavage. Tissue cultures were positive for E. coli. The patient received a 6-week course of intravenous Ciprofloxacin followed by 12 weeks of oral Ciprofloxacin. The patient initiated non-weight-bearing ambulation at 6 weeks. Three months after surgery the patient was allowed to progressively bear weight. Radiographic follow-up showed correct integration of the autograft and prosthesis . Currently, after 18 months, the patient walks with the use of a cane and there is no evidence of infection or tumor recurrence.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 After 18 months of follow-up, a plain AP radiograph of the pelvis shows correct integration of the autograft and prosthesis.</u>\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Since the routine use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy began in the 1980s, limb salvage surgery reconstruction is generally the favored treatment option when managing extensive primary bone tumours, with limb salvage rates above 90% in most major centers. Endoprostheses have several advantages over biological reconstruction methods, being readily available in both custom-made and modular forms, initially reliable with low complication rates, and allowing rapid return to full weight bearing with predictable function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Endoprosthetic replacement following tumor resection is a good treatment option for proximal femoral malignant lesions, due to its low complication rate and good postoperative function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>; however, the management of a proximal femoral malignant lesion with intra-articular involvement is challenging, especially in pediatric patients. The resection of a tumor at the level of the proximal femur results in loss of abductors and other musculature necessary for hip stability. This often leads to a higher dislocation rate. Hip dislocation is a recognized problem after the use of megaprostheses, with rates of dislocation varying from 1.7% to around 28% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7, 8\\]</u>. To reduce the risk of dislocation in our case, we decided to use a bipolar hemiarthroplasty as it is inherently more stable than total hip replacement. We reattached the abductors to a surgical mesh and directly to the prosthesis attachment site.\n\n【18】Periacetabular en bloc resection of the pelvis (Enneking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> type II resection) including the anterior and posterior columns is the traditional treatment for malignant bone lesions affecting the hip joint, but this option may result in substantial loss of pelvic bone stock and compromise pelvic stability. Although several other reconstructive procedures have been reported, including pelvic prosthesis arthroplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–14\\]</u>, allograft reconstruction (with or without a total hip prosthesis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u> arthrodesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 17\\]</u>, and pseudarthrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, a gold standard has yet to be established owing to poor postoperative function and major complication rates ranging from 33% to 56%.\n\n【19】Rüdiger et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> described a posterior-column-preserving technique for the treatment of intra-articular malignant lesions, using the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy introduced in the 1980s by Ganz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> for the treatment of hip dysplasia. They reported two cases with intra-articular extension of a proximal femoral malignant lesion treated with extra-articular resection of the hip, reconstructed with a structural acetabular allograft and endoprosthetic replacement maintaining the continuity and stability of the pelvic ring. The use of the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy in our case had the main advantage of preserving the stability of the pelvic ring and also preserving a large bone contact area with intact vascular supply from the superior gluteal artery to the supra-acetabular and posterior column bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. Both facts contributed to early consolidation/integration of the irradiated graft and allowed increased loading of the hip and range-of-motion training 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Extracorporeal irradiation of autogenous timorous bone and its use for reimplantation was first described in 1968, by Spira and Lubin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Since then, extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation (ECI) has been used as a surgical limb salvage technique for musculoskeletal malignant lesions. The major advantages of this surgical technique are biological reconstruction, no risk of disease transmission or immunological reaction, ready availability, and preservation of bone stock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. A recently published case series of 30 malignant tumours treated with extracorporeal irradiation and posterior reimplantation reported 90% excellent and good results, with two cases of surgical failure, and a 10% infection rate as the main complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. In our case, although no evidence of tumor extension into the acetabulum was seen on MRI, there was extension into the capsule joint due to the pathological neck fracture. For this reason we considered the tumor as intra-articular and performed an extra-articular resection of the hip joint, in order to secure wide excision margins. Taking into account that we were treating a skeletally immature patient, we decided to reimplant the resected acetabulum after irradiation, in order to guarantee a perfect geometric match and because we did not have access to an acetabulum allograft of pediatric size.\n\n【21】The irradiation of the autologous acetabular graft in a skeletally immature patient may result in a premature fusion of the triradiate physeal cartilage. Fusion of the triradiate cartilage, as seen in young patients with pelvic or acetabular fractures, produces a disparate growth between the femoral head and the acetabulum, with subsequent incongruence of the hip joint resulting in subluxation of the femoral head, similar to the mechanism in developmental dysplasia of the hip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. In our case, although we reimplanted the autologous acetabular graft after extracorporeal irradiation, we replaced the proximal femur with a megaprosthesis, which should avoid future incongruence or mismatch between the prosthetic bipolar head and the acetabulum.\n\n【22】We conclude that an extra-articular resection of the hip using the Bernese periacetabular technique, followed by reconstruction with an extracorporeally irradiated acetabular autograft and a proximal femur modular megaprosthesis, is a useful combined treatment option for malignant femoral lesions involving the hip joint, especially in pediatric patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Chronic respiratory disease may be associated with severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We review a case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patient who developed acute breathlessness post COVID-19 infection, also focusing on the diagnostic approach. Case. A 69-year-old gentleman with background history of COPD GOLD D and ischemic heart disease was admitted with severe COVID-19 infection. He required high-flow nasal cannula upon presentation. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) thorax at day 10 of illness revealed moderate organizing pneumonia (OP) with emphysematous changes, without pulmonary embolism. He received oral baricitinib and intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days, which was then followed by tapering prednisolone starting dose of 1 mg/kg/day (60 mg/day) with reduction of 10 mg prednisolone every 3 days. COPD pharmacotherapy was optimized with early utilization of dual bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid was withheld. He underwent inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation and was discharged with home oxygen therapy. Unfortunately, he was re-admitted after 2 weeks with shortness of breath and fever for 3 days. Blood results revealed leucocytosis with raised C-reactive protein. A repeat CTPA showed increase reticulations and crazy paving pattern with reduction in lung volume. Multidisciplinary team discussion concluded it as interstitial pneumonia with COVID-19 OP and fibrosis progression. Prednisolone was stopped and he responded well with antibiotics. A follow-up at 3 months post COVID-19 infection showed improvement of clinical symptoms with radiological resolution of ground glass changes. Conclusion. Corticosteroid inhaler should be cautioned in this case, in view of recent pneumonia and non-elevated serum eosinophil count. These groups of patients should be closely followed up to unmask interstitial lung disease that may present prior to COVID-19 and worsen post-infection. Optimizing pre-existing medical conditions should be the paramount intervention.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors return to their baseline state of health after acute COVID-19 infection, but a proportion of patients experience worsening respiratory symptoms. The complex pathophysiology that happens post COVID-19 infection leads to a wide range of differential diagnoses for COVID-19 survival who presented again with breathlessness. This could be related to their own pulmonary commodities, previous undiagnosed interstitial lung disease, or post COVID-19 infection complications such as pulmonary embolism, organizing pneumonia, and secondary bacterial infection. In this literature, we review a case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patient who developed acute breathlessness post COVID-19 infection, also focusing on the diagnostic approach.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】A 69-year-old gentleman with 120-pack-year smoking history was admitted with RT PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. He has background history of diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and COPD GOLD D. He was on tiotropium and olodaterol inhalers, tablet aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and basal bolus insulin injection.\n\n【6】During the 1<sup>st</sup> admission for COVID-19 infection, he presented with 3-day history of cough and shortness of breath. Clinically, he was tachypnoeic with RR 28 bpm. Arterial blood gas showed type 1 respiratory failure and he required high-flow nasal cannula FiO<sub>2</sub> 0.6 60 L/min. A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive with raised CRP 20 mg/L. Otherwise, white blood cells (WBC) were normal (7 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and other blood tests were unremarkable. Chest radiograph showed bilateral lower zone ground glass opacity. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) thorax on day 10 of illness revealed moderate organizing pneumonia with a background of emphysematous changes and no pulmonary embolism 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c))</u>.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The sequences of CT thorax at day 10 of COVID-19 illness (a–c) showed moderate GGO with organizing pneumonia in the background of emphysematous lung (blue arrow). Second CT thorax at day 42 post COVID-19 infection (d–f) showed worsening bilateral ground glass opacity with reticulations and crazy paving pattern (red arrow) most prominent at bilateral lower lobes. There is also reduction in lung volume with displaced fissures (yellow arrow). Third CT thorax at 5 months post COVID-19 infection (g–i) showed significant improvement of GGO with residual reticulations in apical region and lung bases.</u>\n\n【8】He was treated with oral baricitinib and intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days which was then changed to tapering dose of prednisolone with starting dose of 1 mg/kg/day (60 mg/day) and reduction of 10 mg prednisolone every three days. He underwent inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation and was discharged after 22 days of admission with short-term oxygen therapy.\n\n【9】He presented again after two weeks with three-day history of cough and shortness of breath. Clinically, he was febrile with temperature of 38°C. He appeared tachypnoeic with SpO2 92% under room air. Lung examination revealed minimal bi-basal fine crepitations without audible wheeze. There was no pedal oedema and jugular venous pressure was not raised. Blood investigation showed leucocytosis with WBC 16 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and raised CRP 45 mg/L. Other blood investigations including renal profile and liver function test were normal. Sputum and blood culture were negative. A repeated CTPA thorax showed worsening ground glass opacity with reticulations and crazy paving pattern. There was also reduction in lung volume with displaced fissures. Otherwise, there was no organizing pneumonia or pulmonary embolism 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(d), 1(e), and 1(f))</u>.\n\n【10】Multidisciplinary team discussion concluded it as post COVID-19 infection with progressive fibrosis and concomitant secondary bacterial infection. He was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g QID. The prednisolone was stopped due to an active infection. Bronchoscopy was not performed as he responded well with the antibiotic therapy. He was discharged after 1 week with long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>\\-agonist (LABA) plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination inhaler and underwent outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\n【11】A follow-up at 3 months post COVID-19 infection showed improvement of clinical symptoms and radiological resolution of crazy paving pattern 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(g), 1(h), and 1(i))</u>. His full lung function at 3 months post COVID-19 infection revealed restrictive ventilatory defect with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 1.67 L (72% predicted), forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1.74 L (64% predicted), ratio FEV1/FVC<sub>1</sub> 0.96, total lung capacity (TLC) of 69% predicted, and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 59% predicted. In addition, impulse oscillometry (IOS) showed an elevated difference between resistance at 5 Hz and 20 Hz (R5-R20) of 0.13 kPa/L/S. The presence of restrictive ventilatory defect with IOS results supports the diagnosis of post COVID-19 interstitial lung disease with concomitant COPD with emphysema. At this juncture, we have diagnosed him with resolving interstitial lung disease (ILD) and therefore no definitive treatment for ILD was warranted.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】COVID-19 pneumonia-related dyspnoea is likely to improve over time but may have a protracted course, especially in our patient who has severe pulmonary involvement. The general treatment strategy should address the underlying reasons of dyspnoea, which is often multifactorial. In this case, the probable causes of dyspnoea include exacerbation of COPD, secondary bacteria infection, and post COVID-19 pumonary fibrosis. We have optimized COPD pharmacotherapy with early utilization of dual bronchodilators based on the severity of the symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroid inhaler should be cautioned in this case, in view of recent pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u> and non-elevated serum eosinophil count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Furthermore, it should not be used as a part of triple therapy for the initial pharmacotherapy option. Inhaled corticosteroids have been recently investigated for the potential treatment of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 infection; however, current data are insufficient to support the efficacy in treating acute COVID-19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>.\n\n【14】We prescribed home oxygen therapy for this patient in view of severe hypoxaemia. There was doubtful recovery of the lung function as existing lung abnormalities were further impaired by the recent COVID-19 pneumonia. Elderly patients with pre-existing lung abnormality were associated with prolonged hospital admission and difficulty of weaning oxygen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. American Thoracic Society and British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines recommended severe hypoxaemia to be defined as PaO2 60 mmHg or 7.3 kPa, or SpO2 88% on room air in patients with chronic lung disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. However, a recent study suggested 92% on maximum of 3 L/min oxygen flow as the criteria for discharge with home oxygen for COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The study showed low mortality and re-admission rate in their cohort. Low threshold to prescribe home oxygen therapy in post COVID-19 was a reasonable approach to allow early discharge and preserve limited acute care bed.\n\n【15】Unfortunately, the patient was re-admitted to our centre with worsening symptoms despite dual bronchodilators and home oxygen therapy. This raised the question of the possibility of ongoing organizing pneumonia from resolving the COVID-19 infection and re-introduction of steroid treatment. In a retrospective study of 837 survivors of COVID-19, 5% had evidence of organizing pneumonia, and initiation of corticosteroid treatment resulted in improved symptoms, imaging, and function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, adopting a similar approach in this case should be cautioned as the patient presented with fever and repeat CT scan predominantly showed worsening ground glass changes with the absence of organizing pneumonia features. Furthermore, the CT scan findings should be interpreted with accompanying clinical contexts, as in this case, bacterial infection and patient did improve with broad-spectrum antibiotic. Prescribing prolonged steroid treatment without exclusion of infection would be detrimental and associated with unnecessary steroid toxicity.\n\n【16】Post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is defined as the presence of persistent fibrotic changes identified on follow-up CT scans and associated with functional impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The prevalence was between 9% and 85% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>, and these wide variations were mainly attributed to the timing of the assessment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The risk factors for progression of post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis were related to patient factors and COVID-19 severity, namely, in the present case, age >50 years, significant smoking history, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with emphysema, severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and the use of non-invasive ventilation. Furthermore, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the only comorbidity associated with post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Meta-analysis of post COVID-19 infection demonstrated progression of acute viral pneumonitis to parenchyma lung damage and fibrotic changes within three to six months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. However, none of the fibrotic-like changes were described as end-stage lung fibrosis changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Majority of restrictive impairment observed within one and three months among post COVID-19 patients had resolved by 12 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. However, the proportion of patients with abnormal gas transfer remained elevated at the same period. None of these patients were subjected to specific treatments or interventions.\n\n【18】The definite treatment for post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is not completely determined yet. An observational study of early corticosteroid treatment has reported rapid and significant improvement in lung volume and gas transfer in persistent post COVID-19 interstitial lung disease patients (ILD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, there was lack of control group for comparison and the improvements may reflect ongoing natural lung recovery post COVID-19 infection. Anti-fibrotic showed potential inhibition of acute lung injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> and anti-inflammatory properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18–20\\]</u>; however, its safety profile, efficacy, subgroups of patients who would benefit, and the timing for initiation of treatment have not yet been established for COVID-19 patients.\n\n【19】Patients with ILD and a pre-existing risk factor for lung fibrosis as described in our case should be closely followed up after COVID-19 infection for progression of ILD. BTS recommended comprehensive assessments of symptoms, lung physiology, and imaging at 3 months while further serial assessments at 6 months and 12 months were warranted to differentiate those who have resolving and progressive ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. At the present juncture, we have diagnosed him with resolving ILD and therefore no definitive treatment for ILD was warranted. However, we remain cautious of the risk of ILD progression and therefore subsequent follow-up is required as per BTS recommendation.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】The causes of dyspnoea in post COVID-19 patient are often multifactorial. Comprehensive assessments of symptoms, lung physiology, and chest imaging will navigate the differential diagnosis. These groups of patients should be closely followed up to unmask interstitial lung disease that may present prior to COVID-19 and worsen post-infection. Optimizing pre-existing medical conditions should be the paramount intervention while specific treatment for COVID-19 ILD remains experimental at this moment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 76-year-old Caucasian female was referred to our department due to a 6-month history of constant aching pain over her left hip region. Imaging features were very typical of a primary bone tumor and thus, as tentative diagnosis chondrosarcoma was made by the reporting radiologist . Subsequently performed tumor staging revealed the tumor as being a primary with an otherwise clear bone scan, CT chest, and abdomen. There was no evidence of metastatic disease. However, imaging of the kidneys suggested possible renal cell carcinoma involving the right kidney.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Preoperative MRI showing the left femur of a 76-year-old Caucasian female with diagnosis dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (a) anterior-posterior axial view, (b) anterior-posterior front view. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】Biopsy specimen of the proximal left femur revealed a biphasic tumor composed of a cartilaginous component with abrupt transition into a noncartilaginous malignant mesenchymal component . The diagnosis of a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma was made.

Wide surgical margins were achieved. Although the patient was reasonably fit, adjuvant chemotherapy was not given due to the patient’s age.\n\n【11】During the further course of treatment, the suspicious condition in the right kidney, that had already been present during initial tumor staging prior to limb salvage surgery, was diagnosed as clear-cell renal cell carcinoma  and immediately subjected to nephrectomy. There was no evidence of metastatic disease. After more than 5 years of followup the patient is still free of disease.\n\n【12】Besides the current complaints described above, the patient underwent hysterectomy and cholecystectomy years ago. She could not remember the reason and there is no documentation discussing why those operations were performed. However, her medical family history  revealed that her youngest brother started suffering from invasive medium- to-low differentiated urothelial carcinoma  of the bladder when he was 67-year-old. He died at age 69 of a fibroblastic osteosarcoma  located in his left femur. Their mother presented with renal cell carcinoma as well when she was 65-year-old (specimen not available).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Pedigree of the family presented, RCC: renal cell carcinoma, CHS: chondrosarcoma, OS: osteosarcoma, BL: urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | (a) Biopsy specimen of the proximal left femur of a 69-year-old Caucasian male with diagnosis fibroblastic osteosarcoma (200x), H.E.

Moreover, the entire coding (exons 2–11) region and flanking intron regions of TP53 were sequenced. Since both MLPA and sequenciation did not reveal pathologic changes of the TP53 gene, the GAG-banding pattern derived from cell division was analyzed as well. However, chromosomal aberrations were not detected in the cytogenetic analysis neither for structural or numerical reasons. Taking into account all the results obtained, the diagnosis of LFS could not be confirmed, but there is still uncertainty regarding a definitive diagnosis in terms of a possible new genetic syndrome.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Due to a rare combination of urinary tract and bone tumors occurring in the family presented herein, we hypothesized a hereditary predisposition and thus, the tentative diagnosis Li-Fraumeni syndrome was made.\n\n【18】In fact, positive family anamnesis is an important risk factor for cancer. The genetic defect in LFS is a germline mutation at the tumor suppressor gene p53 with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Accordingly, children of affected parents are at 50% risk of being mutation carriers. As the family pedigree shown in Figure 3 points out that there are a lot of children, a diagnosed syndrome could be very helpful to reduce risk for unaffected offspring. However, none of the offspring has yet developed cancer .\n\n【19】Due to a variety of neoplasms and the family history reported herein, LFS was strongly considered nevertheless. In contrast to other syndromes, for instance neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, LFS is characterized by various but characteristic multiple primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Accordingly, significant differences in the distribution of bone tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, leukemia, melanoma, lung cancer, tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas should be expected compared with the general population. Although an early age at onset is frequent, patients are also at increased risk of developing multiple primary late-onset malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The overall lifetime risk of cancer is estimated close to 80% in patients with pathologic changes of the TP53 gene; approximately 40% develops cancer during the first two decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Further explanations like variable expressivity and germline mosaicism or de novo mutation in the patient brother’s TP53 gene were considered but finally denied due to low probability. Nonmedical explanations, including alternate paternity or maternity or undisclosed adoption, were explored and ruled out by means of family examination. Furthermore, a nonsyndromic cause of familial cancer is still being reasonable as pathologic changes of the TP53 gene have not been proven. Based on current data, some minor changes found in the DNA sequence can be classified as polymorphism without pathologic significance; however, current data may be subject to change. A genetic predisposition, perhaps due to other, currently unknown factors may still not be excluded. Besides, MLPA and sequenciation as methods for genetic testing may perhaps be too limited.

He had recently recovered from COVID-19 infection and returned home on room air. Chest imaging showed bilateral hydropneumothoraces that were not present on the imaging performed during his prior admission three weeks ago. The patient was treated with bilateral chest tube drainage and oxygen support and responded well to treatment. This case represents a unique occurrence of spontaneous loculated bilateral hydropneumothoraces in the context of recent clinical recovery from COVID-19 infection requiring inpatient treatment. This case highlights the importance of an awareness of a potential sequela of COVID-19 that may occur even after presumed clinical recovery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Despite being nearly two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to see novel disease presentations and complications. While common symptoms include fatigue and dyspnea, more severe complications may include pulmonary, vascular, and neurological manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Of additional interest are late complications of COVID-19 that present with new symptoms. Currently, there are isolated case reports of sequelae occurring late in the disease state or even after clinical resolution and inpatient discharge.\n\n【4】The incidence of pneumothorax, in particular, has been of interest to researchers, and previous works have estimated that this complication may occur in 1% of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospital admission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is more commonly seen as a manifestation of barotrauma in patients on mechanical ventilation; however, some reports have discussed increased incidence even in nonintubated patients with ARDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Loculated pneumothorax refers to a pneumothorax with localized air trapping within the pleural space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. They occur typically due to pleural pathology, including empyema, parapneumonic effusions, malignancy, or incomplete pleurodesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A hydropneumothorax is defined by the presence of both air and fluid in the pleural space. Bilateral presentation of pneumothorax is less common than unilateral presentation, with a reported incidence of approximately 1.6% of pneumothoraces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Most pneumothoraces are attributable to some known causative factor, with spontaneous pneumothorax being rarer and traditionally associated with tall and thin male patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here, we present a case of delayed presentation of bilateral spontaneous hydropneumothoraces in a patient who had recently recovered from COVID-19 infection. This is the first case of a unique presentation of this complication to the best of our knowledge.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 53-year-old male presented to an outside hospital with worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, and back pain. He had been hospitalized for 6 days at another hospital, three weeks ago, due to COVID-19 infection. At that time, his symptoms included headaches, fever, nausea, and shortness of breath. During this hospital stay, his COVID-19 symptoms ranged from mild to moderate severity. He required neither ICU admission nor mechanical ventilation, and there were no significant complications during the hospital stay. He had received remdesivir and dexamethasone, and as the symptoms improved, he was discharged home on room air. Initially, he continued to improve for a week after discharge. However, he slowly began to experience progressive chest pain, back pain, and productive cough, which prompted him to return to the emergency department.\n\n【8】His past medical history was relatively uneventful. He denied smoking and drug use, although he endorsed occasional alcohol use. He denied any ongoing health issues or previous surgeries. He had infrequently sought medical attention in the past.\n\n【9】Upon arrival at the outside hospital, he was febrile and hypoxic and required supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> >90%. CT scan performed was negative for pulmonary embolism but revealed bilateral ground-glass infiltrates consistent with recent COVID-19 pneumonia. The imaging also showed bilateral posterior lung lesions with air-fluid levels, suspicious for lung abscesses . Compared to his prior imaging from a few weeks ago, these lesions were new . At this point, the patient was transferred to our institution for further pulmonary and infectious disease workup. Upon presentation to our emergency room, the patient continued to endorse pleuritic chest pain and back pain. His vital signs were as follows: a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure of 147/78, heart rate of 92, respiratory rate of 22, and SpO<sub>2</sub> of 93% on room air. He could speak in complete sentences and required 3 L/min supplemental oxygen to maintain normal SpO<sub>2</sub>. His physical exam was significant for decreased lung sounds posteriorly on auscultation bilaterally.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 CTA from the outside hospital imaged prior to transfer demonstrating large cystic lesions in the (a) axial, (b) sagittal, and (c) coronal views.</u>\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Anteroposterior chest radiographs of the patient during COVID-19 infection approximately 1 month prior to the current hospital admission.</u>\n\n【12】The patient was admitted to the medical unit for diagnostic workup and medical management. The complete blood count (CBC) showed a white blood cell count of 10,400/mm<sup>3</sup> with 70% neutrophils, a hemoglobin level of 15.3 g/dL, and platelets of 352 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL. Serum chemistries, liver function tests, and procalcitonin levels were within normal limits.\n\n【13】The initial differentials included infectious etiologies that cause lung abscesses, including bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial infections. An extensive infectious disease workup including respiratory cultures, fungal serologies, and HIV and acid-fast smears was conducted, and results were grossly negative. Bronchoscopy and bronchoscopic alveolar lavage were also negative for identification of infectious etiology. Upon further review of chest films with our radiologist, it was determined that the air and fluid levels were in the pleural space and the patient had bilateral loculated hydropneumothoraces. On further questioning, the patient denied any recent trauma and surgical interventions.\n\n【14】Once the diagnosis of bilateral loculated hydropneumothoraces was made, traumatic and iatrogenic causes were considered. However, the patient denied any history of trauma and recent lung-related procedures. A congenital problem was also unlikely, as chest imaging did not have these lesions a few weeks prior.\n\n【15】Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started initially, but they were discontinued as the infectious workup returned negative. Once the diagnosis of loculated hydropneumothoraces was confirmed, bilateral 8.5-French pigtail catheters were placed into the patient’s posterior left and right hemithoraces under ultrasound guidance . Analysis of the drained pleural fluid was performed. No malignant cells were identified; reactive appearing mesothelial cells and blood were noted. The fluid consisted of fluid protein 4.9 g/dL, albumin 2.9 g/dL, amylase 17 U/L, cholesterol 130 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 285 U/L, and triglycerides 47 mg/dL. A pathogen panel on the pleural fluid was grossly negative, and cultures of the fluid demonstrated no growth.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Anteroposterior chest radiograph confirming chest tube placement.</u>\n\n【17】A continuous air leak was present in both the chest tubes for the first 3-4 days, raising the concern for bronchopleural fistulas. The thoracic surgery team contemplated surgical intervention, but the air leak began to slow down after the fourth day. Despite the improvements in the air leak, however, the chest tube could not be removed because the cavities continued to reappear whenever suction was discontinued. Repeat chest imaging, two weeks later, showed that the pneumothoraces had decreased in size but were not entirely resolved. Eventually, the patient was discharged home on room air with bilateral chest tubes attached to Heimlich valves.\n\n【18】Repeat imaging was performed at regular intervals using either chest X-ray or CT . Repeat CT at 1 month demonstrated interval resolution of the pleural collections with only a minimal amount of the pleural fluid remaining on the left, and the chest tubes were removed at that time. Repeat CT at 6 weeks (2 weeks after tube removal) was similar to that of 4 weeks, and the hydropneumothoraces were considered resolved . Furthermore, routine imaging was discontinued at that time.\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Anteroposterior chest radiograph taken 1 week after chest tube placement.</u>\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 Repeat CT demonstrating resolution of hydropneumothoraces in the (a) axial and (b) coronal views.</u>\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】Pneumothorax is a relatively rare complication of COVID-19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However, many reports found a higher incidence of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 compared to other causes of ARDS and proposed a few possible mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The significant air hunger in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 infection leads to increased tidal volume and respiratory rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Increased respiratory drive with intense patient inspiratory efforts results in large tidal volumes, which can result in major swings in transpulmonary pressures. These transpulmonary pressure changes increase the risk of air leaking outside the alveolar space (pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Large tidal volume swings and changes in transpulmonary pressures also perpetuate a form of lung injury called patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】While the possible mechanisms of pneumothorax in the context of an ongoing COVID-19 infection have been described, there has been substantially less discussion of the mechanisms and risk factors of pneumothorax after clinical recovery from COVID-19. Review of the recent literature demonstrates that there have been only a handful of cases of a spontaneous pneumothorax after clinical recovery from COVID-19. Notably, some of these cases have occurred in a patient without any underlying risk factors for pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11,12\\]</u>. Thus, this complication appears to have the potential to develop in the absence of traditionally implicated risk factors, which include the presence of active pulmonary disease, treatment using mechanical ventilation, or smoking status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Similarly, there are also insufficient data currently to determine whether vaccination status is protective of this particular late complication in patients who do develop COVID-19.\n\n【24】Our case presents a unique variation of this complication that is noteworthy for two reasons. First is the delayed presentation, i.e. the patient presented after clinical resolution of the acute COVID-19 infection. Second is the atypical radiological characteristics, i.e. it is rare for a patient to have bilateral loculated spontaneous hydropneumothoraces in any context, and ours may be the only reported case of such a complication after COVID-19 infection.\n\n【25】We could not confidently ascertain the etiology of delayed pneumothoraces even upon detailed history and exam. The patient’s demographics did not fit those typical of spontaneous pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. He did not have any pleural or pulmonary procedures or any form of trauma that could have led air to enter the pleural space. In addition, the pneumothoraces were not present on chest imaging performed during the previous hospitalization a few weeks prior  and this delayed manifestation makes this pathology even rarer. The initial radiologic read of the bilateral lung lesions was noncommittal and led to the workup of infectious etiologies. However, reviewing the imaging again with the chest radiologist established that the abnormalities were in the pleural space.\n\n【26】While there is no conclusive way to say that bilateral loculated spontaneous hydropneumothoraces were due to the patient’s recent COVID-19 infection, the temporal relationship of the illness and the abnormalities a few weeks later, the absence of any other apparent causes, and other reports of increased risk of pneumothorax in COVID-19 patients justify this attribution as highly likely.\n\n【27】The medical community is still just beginning to understand the possible short- and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infections. As clinicians continue to study the widespread effects of the virus and its lingering impact, it is plausible and unfortunate that such seemingly rare complications may become more commonplace.\n\n【28】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】Documentation in the literature of the spectrum of possible complications of COVID-19 is vital, as we are still learning more about the varied presentations of COVID-19. Researchers have advocated for the importance of both monitoring and counseling in the context of recovery from COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This case, among others reporting on sequelae of known COVID-19 infections, provides evidence to justify resource allocation toward continued outpatient monitoring and primary care visits in the weeks and months following resolution of an inpatient stay for COVID-19.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

So far there are no cases in the literature defining the histological features of this morphologic spectrum in detail. In this study we presented two classical-type cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma cases with histologic findings resembling cavernous hemangioma in company with clinical and histopathological data. Cases. One hundred and eighty-five classical-type cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma lesions in 79 patients were assessed retrospectively in terms of histopathological features. Findings of two cases showing features of cavernous hemangioma-like Kaposi sarcoma whose clinical data could be accessed were presented in accompany with the literature data. Both cases were detected to have bluish-purple, protruded, irregularly bordered cutaneous lesions. Histopathological examination revealed a lesion formed by cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures organized in a lobular pattern that became dilated and filled with blood. Typical histological findings of early-stage KS, consisting of mononuclear inflammation, extravasated erythrocytes, and a few immature vascular structures in superficial dermis, were observed. All cases were serologically HIV-1 negative. A positive reaction with HHV-8, CD31, CD34, and D2-40 monoclonal antibodies was identified at both cavernous hemangioma-like areas and in immature vascular structures. Results. Cavernous hemangioma-like Kaposi sarcoma is a rare Kaposi sarcoma variant presenting with diagnostic challenges, that may be confused with hemangioma. As characteristic morphological features may not be observed in every case, it is important for diagnostic purposes to show immunohistochemical HHV-8 positivity in this variant.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a rare vascular lesion with four different epidemiological forms (classical, African (endemic), iatrogenic, and AIDS related) caused by human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It may have various clinical and histopathological features. More than 10 histological subtypes has been defined so far (e.g. anaplastic, lymphangioma-like, and micronodular KS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. While clinical appearance of lesions is different from usual type KS in some subtypes (e.g. bullous, verrucous, and ecchymotic KS), most histological subtypes do not have a prominent discriminatory clinical feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. Despite being variable by lesion stage, some characteristic findings are important in histopathological diagnosis. Among these are immature vascular formations intersecting collagen to form cleft- or mesh-like patterns and spindle cells that are considered to be the main neoplastic component. Hyaline globules, hemosiderin pigment, and lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells frequently accompany neoplastic vascular structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. In KS spindle cells and neoplastic vascular structures react positively with endothelial markers (e.g. CD31, CD34, and D2-40) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most important point in the diagnosis of KS is to show HHV-8 immunopositivity supporting histological findings in the neoplastic component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Since they are considerably rare, we discussed two cases of classical-type cutaneous KS exhibiting cavernous hemangioma-like features in company with clinical and histopathological findings and stressed the importance of HHV-8 immunoreactivity in differential diagnosis of these lesions.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】This study enrolled 185 cases of classical-type cutaneous KS lesions of 79 patients who were diagnosed at Bülent Ecevit University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Pathology, and Dr. Lütfi Kırdar Kartal Training and Research Hospital between 2001 and 2012 and whose data could be retrieved. Clinical information of the cases was obtained by screening medical files and reassessing materials of pathology archive for histopathological and immunohistochemical data. No patient had a history of immunosuppressive drug use or transplantation. All patients were human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) negative.\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Histopathological and Immunohistochemical Assessment\n\n【8】Diagnosis of KS was confirmed by reviewing of Hematoxyline&Eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Histopathological progression of the lesions were grouped into early (patchy), intermediate (plaque), and late (nodule/tumor)-stage KS according to previously specified criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 8\\]</u>. All lesions were examined immunohistochemically with HHV-8 (LNA-1) and endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, and D2-40).\n\n【9】Among retrospectively examined biopsy samples, lesions, the dominant histopathological component which is composed by cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures and in which typical histological features of KS are observed at focal areas, were classified as cavernous hemangioma-like Kaposi sarcoma (CHLKS) . Vascular structures that were lined by flattened endothelium, dilated, and filled by blood were considered to have cavernous hemangioma-like feature. Characteristic findings of KS (e.g. those of immature vascular proliferations that are infiltrative bordered, contain intracytoplasmic lumen, and form mesh- and cleft-like structures and/or spindle cell proliferation) were assessed in accordance with the previously specified criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【11】Retrospective assessment of archive materials of 185 classical-type cutaneous KS lesions belonging to 79 patients revealed that histopathological features of lesions of 2 cases were consistent with CHLKS. Clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical findings of these cases were summarized below.\n\n【12】##### 3.1. Case 1\n\n【13】###### 3.1.1. Clinical Assessment\n\n【14】A 69-year-old man presented with purple spots at both feet. The lesions had begun at the lateral aspects of the feet and their number and size increased gradually. He had a 10-year hypertension history for which he had been taking medications. Dermatologic examination revealed multiple purple-colored plaques and papules of 0.5–1.5 cm, some of which were covered with crust on the dorsum of feet and around the ankles. He had no pathology in laboratory and serologic examinations. Physical examination revealed no signs suggestive of systemic involvement of KS, including suggestive symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and visceral involvement. He was HIV-1 negative in serological examination. Biopsies were taken from the lesions with an initial diagnosis of KS.\n\n【15】The patient underwent cryotherapy for the Kaposi sarcoma lesions in lower extremity. The patient was followed at 6-month intervals for 22 months, and new cutaneous lesions of Kaposi sarcoma in lower extremities were treated with cryotherapy. No systemic involvement or an aggressive course was present.\n\n【16】###### 3.1.2. Histopathological Findings\n\n【17】H&E sections of the lesion demonstrated a dilated, blood-filled vascular proliferation lined by flattened endothelium stretching from papillary dermis under hyperkeratotic squamous epithelium to reticular dermis, forming lobular patterns. A few thick-walled vascular structures were observed in that lesion that was composed of thin-walled vessels. A hemosiderin accumulation was noted at the vessel wall and surrounding stroma. Chronic inflammatory cells and histological findings of early-stage KS such as vascular structures forming clefts, hemosiderin pigment, and extravasated erythrocytes were observed around the cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures, and these findings were more prominent at papillary dermis. At these areas a prominence of nucleolus and mild atypia was notable in endothelial cells lining vascular structures. The lesion did not show spindle cell proliferation, a finding observed at advanced stages of KS. Cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures formed about 80% of the lesion, and typical histopathological findings of early-stage KS were observable at focal sites inside the lesion.\n\n【18】##### 3.2. Case 2\n\n【19】###### 3.2.1. Clinical Assessment\n\n【20】A 70-year-old female patient presented with the complaint of purple discolorations on the dorsum of the right foot, which had been present for 2 years and growing in number. Her past history was remarkable for an operation against colon carcinoma 10 years ago. She had not taken chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She also had goiter for 5 years. Dermatologic examination revealed multiple purple-colored macular lesions with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 1 cm on the dorsum of the right foot. Her serologic examination was negative for HIV-1. Systemic examination and laboratory tests were negative for a finding suggestive of systemic involvement of KS. Biopsies were taken from the lesions with an initial diagnosis of KS.\n\n【21】The patient was treated with local excision and cryotherapy for cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma lesions. The patient was followed at six month periods for a total of 11 months. During follow-up, local recurrences were detected in lower and upper extremities and treated with cryotherapy. No systemic involvement or an aggressive course was present during follow-up.\n\n【22】###### 3.2.2. Histopathological Findings\n\n【23】H&E sections of the lesion revealed a vascular proliferation forming more than 90% of the lesion at the dermis, which had similar features with the first case. The lesion was composed of vascular structures filled by blood, which were lined by flattened endothelium and organized as lobular patterns, some of which included fibrous septa. Some vascular structures were closely spaced from skin adnexae that were surrounded by hemosiderin pigment. At the papillary dermis adjacent to the lesion were immature vascular structures intersecting collagen and extravasated erythrocytes, findings of the early-stage KS. No spindle cell proliferation was evident in the lesion.\n\n【24】###### 3.2.3. Immunohistochemical Findings\n\n【25】Immunohistochemical examinations of lesions from both cases showed a strong reaction with endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, and D2-40) and HHV-8 (LNA-1) both in endothelia of the cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures and at the areas of early-stage KS. Endothelia of the mature vascular structures adjacent to the lesions had a positive reaction with Factor VIIIra whereas neoplastic vascular structures were negative. A focal positive reaction was present with actin and desmin at the walls of the cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures. In the light of clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical findings, both lesions were interpreted as classical-type early-stage cutaneous KS, that showed features similar to cavernous hemangioma.\n\n【26】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【27】KS is a vascular neoplasm with a low malignancy potential, which is caused by HHV-8, has four different epidemiological forms, and has considerably different clinical and histopathological features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8, 12\\]</u>. Cases in which the typical histological features of KS are dominant are designated as usual type KS, and these lesions are classified into patch, plaque, and nodule phases, depending on the clinical progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common histological subtype in all epidemiological forms of KS is the usual type KS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Other common histological subtypes include lymphangioma-like and lymphangiectatic types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4, 13\\]</u>. While bullous, verrucous, and ecchymotic type KS lesions include clinically distinguishable features, most histological subtypes cannot be distinguished clinically from the usual type KS lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5, 6\\]</u>. Anaplastic KS and lymphangioma-like KS have been reported to have a more aggressive course than usual type KS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【28】A wide spectrum of clinical and histopathological morphologies of KS poses a difficulty in differential diagnosis and a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. In certain areas of our country classical-type KS is a commonly encountered cutaneous vascular neoplasm. Thus, knowledge of the histological subtypes and a search for the presence of the virus HHV-8 in cases suspected for KS are important for differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Studies investigating histological subtypes of KS have been mostly case reports including a low number of cases. There are a few studies studying histological subtypes of KS in large samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–6, 16, 17\\]</u>. In this study 185 classical-type cutaneous KS lesions from 79 patients were retrospectively assessed, and two cases showing cavernous hemangioma-like features were reported with regard to histopathological features and differential diagnosis in company with the literature data.\n\n【30】In our study both cases considered as having CHLKS were elderly patients having multiple cutaneous lesions of blue-purple color located in lower extremity. These lesions include typical clinical findings of early-stage KS and do not contain distinguishing features. No history of drug use with attending immunosuppression, transplantation, or HIV infection was notable after clinical and laboratory examinations in the patients.\n\n【31】The common histopathological features of the lesions considered as CHLKS were formation of nearly all lesions by cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures and the presence of typical histological features of early-stage KS at focal areas. The congested vascular structures forming the main component of the lesions are lined by flattened endothelium, and an intimal thickening is notable at the walls of some vascular structures. Although there are no evident atypia in endothelial layer, some endothelial cells became prominent to form protrusions into the lumen. Hemosiderin pigment accumulation is observed at the vessel walls and the surrounding stroma . In the first case, cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures formed nearly the entire lesion, and typical areas of early-stage KS were hardly distinguished. In the second case, on the other hand, characteristic findings of early-stage KS including chronic-type inflammatory cells at the papillary dermis adjacent to the lesion were more marked. It was noteworthy in one case that cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures were in close proximity with skin adnexae without infiltrating them . Immunohistochemical examination of lesions of both cases revealed a strong positive reaction with endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, and D2-40) and HHV-8 (LNA-1) in both endothelial lining of cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures and at areas of typical early-stage KS. While a positive reaction with Factor VIIIra was observed in endothelia of the mature vascular structures neighboring the lesion, no reaction was observed in neoplastic vascular structures. A focal positive reaction with actin and desmin was detected at the walls of the cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures. In the light of all these clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings, these two cases were interpreted as classical-type cutaneous KS showing features similar to cavernous hemangioma.\n\n【32】Differential diagnosis of CHLKS includes many reactive and benign vascular lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 15, 16\\]</u>. In addition, dilated vascular structures resembling cavernous hemangioma may also be seen around the spindle cell proliferation in some lesions at the nodular stage of the usual type of KS . These vascular formations do not contain a prominent wall, and they consist of either spindle cells giving a positive reaction with HHV-8 or a single-row endothelial layer . In these lesions spindle cell proliferation typical of advanced-stage KS is prominent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 18\\]</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Biopsy samples of both cases reveal lesions composed of dilated vascular structures with blood-filled lumen.

Cavernous hemangioma is a vascular lesion that is seen particularly in childhood period and more commonly involves the upper part of the trunk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 19, 20\\]</u>. These lesions have a less defined border and a deeper location, and they may contain degenerative changes including thrombus and dystrophic calcification. Cavernous hemangiomas have dilated vascular structures lined by flattened endothelium, some of which have thick walls containing intimal fibrosis. Mature endothelial cells in cavernous hemangioma give a positive reaction with Factor VIIIra, and pericytic cells give a positive reaction with actin/desmin. Histological differential diagnosis from KS importantly includes spindle cell proliferation, endothelial atypia, and inability to see neoplastic and abnormal vessels intersecting collagen. Absence of immunohistochemical HHV-8 reaction is a finding in favor of cavernous hemangioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 15, 19, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Another lesion in the differential diagnosis of CHLKS is spindle cell hemangioma. Clinically, they present with purple-red, painless, nodular at the acral regions. Histologically, they are formed by spindle cell proliferation forming clefts intertwined with thin-walled cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures. In some cases, similar to hemangioendotheliomas, an intracytoplasmic lumen or a vacuole may be seen in neoplastic cells. The component consisting of spindle cells does not react with endothelial cell markers and it is positive for vimentin/actin/desmin.

Radiographic evidence of a synostosis of the proximal TFJ was demonstrated in 3 knees (3 patients). The synostosis appeared incidental and was not the cause of symptoms in any of them. These patients were further examined with MRI and/or CT scans. In two cases, which were found to be primary (idiopathic), the synostosis was complete and bony. In a third case the lesion was secondary (acquired) to surgical reconstruction for a depressed fracture of the lateral tibial plateau. This iatrogenic complication followed open reduction, internal fixation, and grafting with synthetic bone. The bridging of the joint on the CT views was partial and compatible with ectopic calcification rather than ossification. The patients were treated conservatively and were followed for an average period of 3 years. No evidence that the synostosis accelerated the onset or progression of the degenerative changes to the ipsilateral knee could be verified.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Synostosis of the proximal tibiofibular joint (TFJ) is extremely rare. It may occur in skeletally immature patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>, adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, or adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–9\\]</u>. It may be caused by the coalescence of “kissing” osteochondromata in patients with multiple hereditary exostoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 10\\]</u>, or may be associated with other generalized syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and knee valgus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Synostosis with no associated syndromes or deformities has been previously reported in only 3 patients. In two adults the synostosis was primary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>, while in a 14-year-old girl the iatrogenic lesion was secondary to tibial nailing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our data referring to 3 patients with a unilateral synostosis of the proximal TFJ, identified among 1029 patients examined for degenerative knee arthritis, are presented and discussed.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】A total of 1029 patients, with an age range from 46 to 96 years (mean 71.34 years), were examined clinically and radiologically, in a 4-year period (from 2005 to 2008), for degenerative knee arthritis. There were 817 women with an age range from 46 to 94 years (mean 70.66 years) and 212 men with an age range from 46 to 96 years (mean 74.28 years).\n\n【6】Synostosis of the proximal TFJ was diagnosed in 3 patients (3 knees). None of them was overweight and none of them complained of pain at rest or during the night. They all reported to have “normal” physical activities of daily living and no functional limitations. No symptoms could be detected around the proximal TFJ in any of our patients nor was there any demonstrable peroneal neuropathy. There was no observed difference in the patients with synostosis and the whole group of patients with degenerative arthritis in terms of pain, range of motion, activity level, and weather influences. According to the radiographic staging system of Kellgren and Lawrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, all our patients were classified as having grade I-II disease of the femorotibial joint. In two cases (1 and 2), the lesion was considered to be primary (idiopathic). The lesion was secondary (acquired) in case 3 following a reconstruction for a depressed lateral fracture of the tibial plateau, augmented with synthetic bone graft. In all cases, the right knee was affected. The two primary cases had an oblique-type proximal TFJ articulation. No abnormal features of the proximal TFJ on the controlateral side were radiologically observed. None of the patients had a history of a neoplasm, metabolic disorder, infection, rheumatoid arthritis, or steroid use. All patients received conservative treatment including viscosupplement intra-articular injections. No specific measures were undertaken for the synostosis of the proximal TFJ. Progression of the degenerative changes was evaluated after a follow-up period that ranged from 2 to 4 years (mean 3 years). Total knee arthroplasty was not undertaken by that time and will be delayed as long as the use of nonoperative methods is considered satisfactory. The 3 cases are reported below in details.\n\n【7】Case 1. A man, aged 55 years, complained of peripatellar aching and pain on the medial aspect of the joint, which increased on walking in both knees.  \nOn palpation, patellar crepitation was noted with flexion and extension. Tenderness was present on the medial side of the joint over the medial collateral ligament and under the patella in both knees.  \nAnteroposterior and lateral standing radiographs of the long axis of both legs showed normal hip-knee-ankle alignment, no patellofemoral involvement, narrowing of the medial compartment space more pronounced on the left knee and synostosis of the proximal TFJ on the right knee 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. The fibula had normal length and shape and the position of the proximal TFJ was normal on both sides. The synostosis was considered to be complete and bony by a CT scan 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u> and an MRI 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. At 4-year follow-up the degenerative changes exhibit similar progression on both knees 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(d))</u>. By that time, a severely reduced internal rotation of the right hip joint was diagnosed on clinical examination. Radiograph of the hips indicated narrowing of the joint space, subchondral sclerosis, cyst formation and osteophytes on the right side. No evidence of ankle arthritis was found.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | AP radiograph of both knees (a), CT (b), and MRI (c) examination, in a 55-year-old man, indicating synostosis of the proximal TFJ of the right knee initially, and 4 years later (d). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】Case 2. A 60-year-old woman was referred for pain on the medial aspect of both knees on walking. She had only slight pain going up and down stairs.  \nOn palpation, tenderness was located on the medial side of the joints and over the insertion of the semimembranosus tendon in both knees.  \nAnteroposterior and lateral standing radiographs of the long axis of both legs showed normal hip-knee-ankle alignment, no patellofemoral involvement, mild narrowing of the medial compartment space more pronounced on the right knee and synostosis of the right proximal TFJ 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. The fibula had normal length and shape and the position of the proximal TFJ was normal on both sides. The synostosis was confirmed to be complete and bony by a CT 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u> and a 3D scan 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c))</u>.  \nTwo years later her x-rays showed symmetrical progression of the degenerative changes. There was no evidence of osteoarthritic changes to the hips or ankles.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | AP radiograph of both knees (a), CT (b) and 3D (c) examination, in a 60-year-old woman, showing synostosis of the proximal TFJ of the right knee. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | AP radiograph of both knees (a), and CT (b,c) examination in a 69-year-old woman, revealing ectopic calcification of the proximal TFJ of the right knee. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【12】Case 3. A 69-year-old woman was presented with an 8-year history of a depressed fracture of the lateral tibial plateau of the right knee that was treated with open reduction, internal fixation, and was grafted with synthetic bone material. She complained of pain on walking in the right knee. She had also pain going up and down stairs.  \nOn palpation severe tenderness was present on the medial side of the right knee, especially at the femoral insertion of the medial collateral ligament.  \nAnteroposterior and lateral standing radiographs of the long axis of both legs showed normal hip-knee-ankle alignment, no patellofemoral involvement, narrowing of the medial compartment space and a calcium deposit of the medial collateral ligament at its femoral insertion of the right knee (Pellegrini-Stieda disease). The fibula had normal length and shape and the position of the proximal TFJ was normal on both sides. A synostosis of the proximal TFJ on the right knee was also evident 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. A CT scan confirmed partial synostosis that was characterized by the appearance of a large radiopaque mass in the area of the previously reduced and grafted fracture of the tibial plateau 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(b) and 3(c))</u>.  \nAt 3-year follow-up there was slight progression of the clinical findings and the radiographic degenerative changes. There was no evidence of hip or ankle osteoarthritis.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Tibiofibular synostosis has occasionally been described in the literature. It may be evident in one of the three joints that the tibia and fibula share.\n\n【15】Synostosis of the distal (inferior) TFJ is usually acquired-secondary to ankle fractures. It usually causes few symptoms and does not require any treatment in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, while in children the fibular growth may be altered leading to valgus alignment of the ankle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Synostosis of the middle TFJ (formed by the interosseous membrane) may be located at the level of the junction of the proximal and middle third of the tibia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> or at the middle and distal third of the tibia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Both cases that have been reported in the literature received surgical treatment.\n\n【16】Synostosis of the proximal TFJ has been reported in both children and adults. Whenever the synostosis is present from birth or occurs before the closure of the proximal tibial growth plate, it is usually symptomatic and may be associated with other growth deformities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Predisposing factors may include the syndrome of multiple hereditary exostoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 10\\]</u>, generalized syndromes, like the 49, XXXXY karotype, while the role of knee valgus is unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The absence of any growth abnormalities indicates that the synostosis occurred after physeal closure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Only 3 such patients have previously been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8, 9\\]</u>. On the other hand, synostosis of the proximal TFJ in adults is rarely associated with complaints and may, therefore, be easily missed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Two cases of symptomatic idiopathic synostosis of the proximal TFJ have been previously reported. One of them was a 24-year-old volley-ball player 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and the other one was a 45-year-old man with intermittent peroneal neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The only known reported case of asymptomatic secondary synostosis was a 14-year-old girl 5 years following tibial nailing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【19】All our patients had normal or near normal function and range of motion of the knees and also had no complaints due to the synostosis. The incidence of primary synostosis of the proximal TFJ in our series was 0.1% that is: 2 knees among 1029 patients (2058 knees). In our idiopathic cases (patients 1 and 2), the fibula had a normal length and shape, and the position of the proximal TFJ was normal. These findings indicated that the synostosis developed after the closure of the growth plates in adult life. The inclination of the TFJ surface in both these cases was of the oblique-type articulation, with an inclination of approximately 45 degrees. It is suggested that in the oblique-type articulation the load per surface area of the joint is increased resulting in higher pressure on cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This type of joint could also be more prone to degenerative changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. However, it is questionable whether the appearance of synostosis may, in any way, be affected by the inclination of the proximal TFJ.\n\n【20】The radiological appearance of the synostosis was complete and bony, and was similar in the idiopathic patients (cases 1 and 2), but was partial and appeared as a large radiopaque mass, compatible with ectopic calcification rather than ossification, in the acquired case (patient 3). The pathogenesis of this iatrogenic synostosis might be due to injury of the soft tissues and hemorrhage during surgery, or to the evacuation of a quantity of the synthetic bone graft.\n\n【21】We found no evidence that the synostosis was in any way associated with the onset or progression of osteoarthritic changes to the ipsilateral knee. Furthermore, the radiological assessment of both knees indicated more severe degenerative changes on the ipsilateral knee on two cases (patients 2 and 3) and on the contralateral healthy side in another one (case 1). No osteoarthritic changes were found radiologically in the hips in two patients (cases 2 and 3), while there were severe changes of the ipsilateral hip in one patient (case 1). There was no evidence of ankle arthritis in our patients.\n\n【22】In conclusion, the onset as well as the clinical and radiological progression of the degenerative changes of the knees, in all our 3 patients, was not, in any way, related to the unilateral proximal TFJ synostosis.\n\n【23】#### Conflict of Interest Statement\n\n【24】The author certifies that he has no commercial associations (such as consultancies, stock ownership, equity interest, patent/licensing arrangements, etc.) that might pose a conflict of interest in connection with the submitted article.

It may occur in isolation or as a part of Ascher's syndrome. The occurrence of double lip may result in facial deformity especially when patient attempts to talk, smile, or even try to show the teeth. It affects esthetics and also interferes with speech and mastication. Although surgery may be undertaken to facilitate speech and mastication, majority of cases are operated for cosmetic reasons. A case of congenital double upper lip which was surgically treated for cosmetic reason is reported.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Double lip is one of the rarest forms of lip abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The term double lip is used to describe deformity of either upper or lower lip in which a fold of labial mucosa is apparent at rest or at smiling. It affects upper lip more commonly than lower lip and rarely both lips are affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Double lip usually manifests as two masses of hyperplastic tissue on either side of midline which can sometimes be asymmetrical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Double lip can either be congenital or acquired. Acquired deformity may be secondary to trauma or habits such as sucking lips between diastema or ill fitting dentures. The congenital double lip is believed to be present at birth and becomes more prominent after eruption of teeth. It may occur in isolation or as part of Ascher’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. There appears to be male gender predilection of 7 : 1 for this anomaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The treatment is surgical and usually indicated for cosmetic reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Recurrence is rare. A case of double lip is reported in a 35-year male which was treated by excision of excess of mucosal and submucosal tissues.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 35-year-old male patient came to our department with chief complain of deposits on his teeth and also complained that his upper lip was large and unusual because of which he felt ashamed and wanted to get it corrected . There was no family history of double lip and no previous history of trauma or surgery.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Pre-operative patient’s photograph. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】Upon examination, a thick upper lip was seen with midline constriction band between two mucosal bulges which was even visible at rest . There was no blepharochalasis and no thyroid gland enlargement. A provisional diagnosis of congenital double lip was made and under differential diagnosis chelitis glandularis, angioedema, vascular tumors, chelitis granulomatosa, mucocele, salivary gland tumor, and inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia were considered. His general blood picture was within normal limits. Under local anesthesia, hyperplastic upper labial tissue was demarcated and excised by a transverse elliptical incision from one commissure to another with central Z plasty using blunt and sharp dissection . The minor salivary glands in the field were also removed. The surgical defect was closed using interrupted vicryl sutures . A light pressure dressing was placed over upper lip for first 24 hours. Histopathological report of the specimen showed normal labial mucosa with mucosal glands and capillaries. Sutures were removed after a week and postoperative healing was uneventful . Patient was satisfied with his appearance and new look. Patient was followed up to 2 years with no recurrence, after which was lost for follow-up.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Frontal view of double lip. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Dissection of hyperplastic upper labial tissues. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Sutures placed. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | Immediate postoperative view. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 | Postoperative view after 1 week. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Double lip is an uncommon congenital or acquired anomaly that can have important consequences for the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is generally reported that double upper lip is not evident when lips is at rest but excess fold of tissue projects beyond the vermilion border when lip is tense as in smiling or laughing position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. However in our case, hyperplastic tissue was visible even at rest and became accentuated when he tried to show his teeth. Double upper lip may be present with central constriction due to attachment of upper labial frenum which was similar to our case but cases without central constriction have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Double lip has generally been associated with Ascher’s syndrome but Parmar and Muranjan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and Costa-Hanemann et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> described its presences with cases having different clinical presentation and suggested that it was a new syndrome.\n\n【15】The treatment of double lip is surgical mostly done for cosmetic reasons. Sometimes surgery may be necessary when hyperplastic tissue interferes with speech and mastication. The surgery involves excision of excess mucosa and submucosal without involving underlying muscular layer. Treatment can either be done under general or local anesthesia. Due to presence of central constriction we used double elliptical incisions combined with central vertical Z plasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However W plasty can also achieve similar results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Surgical experience of the surgeon should dictate this choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Because of progressive nature of disorder or suspected Ascher’s syndrome the patient should be followed up because blepharochalasis and nontoxic enlargement of thyroid gland can develop later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although recurrence is rare, Palma and Taub 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported a case of upper lip with recurrence. The patient in this report was followed up for 2 years before he stopped attending.

Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is a heterogenic and rare syndrome characterized by the detection of a persistent absolute CD4 T cells count <300 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (or <20% of total T cells) in more than one occasion and no evidence of HIV infection in absence of immunodeficiency or therapy associated with depressed levels of CD4 T cells. We report the case of a 50-year-old man with a multiorgan IgG4-related disease presenting in a temporal association with a profound and symptomatic idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia. Both clinical pictures improved after steroid treatment. Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia has been associated with a number of autoimmune conditions but, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which an association with the IgG4-related disease is reported.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The IgG4-related disease is a fibroinflammatory disease characterized by tumefactive lesions, a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and often, but not always, elevated levels of IgG4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The IgG4-related disease has been described in several organs and tissues: pancreas, biliary tract, salivary glands, periorbital tissue, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, meninges, aorta, breast, prostate, thyroid, pericardium, and skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. Histopathological characteristics are similar in the different organs concerned with this disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>. The pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease is not completely understood; evidences point to both autoimmune and allergic disorders. IgG4 are considered to have a role in tolerance to allergens and in responses to various infections, but their physiologic role is still poorly understood. There are emerging data showing that the IgG4 antibodies in this disease represent a downregulatory response to an unknown primary inflammatory stimulus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Immune-mediated mechanisms may contribute to the inflammatory process of IgG4-related disease. Various genetic conditions have been associated with the disease (HLA serotypes DRB10405 and DRB10401 increase the susceptibility in Japanese population, whereas DQB1-57 mutations are associated with disease relapse in Korean population). Bacterial infections with a molecular mimicry mechanism and autoimmunity are all considered potential initiating mechanisms.\n\n【5】Autoimmunity is widely regarded as the initial immunologic stimulus for the type 2 helper T (Th2) cell immune response that is predominant in IgG4-related diseases. Serum IgG4 from patients with IgG4-related disease binds to the normal epithelia of the pancreatic ducts, bile ducts, and salivary ducts. Potential autoantigens at these sites include carbonic anhydrases, lactoferrin, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, and trypsinogens. However, these autoantibodies are neither specific for IgG4-related disease nor known to be of the IgG4 subclass. Thus, their role in IgG4-related disease is unclear. Autoimmunity and infectious agents may act as potential immunological triggers of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The predominant immune response is Th2, followed by activation of regulatory T (Treg) cells. This characteristic is at variance with what is observed in the other autoimmune diseases in which the function of Treg cells is impaired 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The activation of Treg cells in IgG4-related disease is suggested by the high expression of the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) mRNA in tissue by the infiltrates of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells at affected sites and by the increased number of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in the blood. In addition, interleukin-10, which is produced by Treg cells as well as by Th2 lymphocytes and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), appears to be overexpressed in IgG4-related disease. TGFβ may play a central role in the fibrosis process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Various interleukins, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, are overexpressed in target organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 7, 9\\]</u>. IgG4 and IgE production is enhanced by the Th2 cells response. Th2-related cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 enhance the production of both IgG4 and IgE. In contrast, interleukin-10, interleukin-12, and interleukin-21 shift the balance between IgG4 and IgE, favouring IgG4 production. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the production of IgG4 is enhanced preferentially in the setting of a Th2 cell dominant immune reaction. This selective IgG4 induction is referred to as the modified Th2 response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–9\\]</u>. In this paper we reported the association between a rare disease, the IgG4-related disease, and the idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL), a heterogenic and rare syndrome of unknown etiology characterized by the detection of a persistent absolute CD4 T cells count <300 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (or <20% of total T cells) in more than one occasion and no evidence of HIV infection in absence of immunodeficiency or therapy associated with depressed levels of CD4 T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphocytopenia is a disorder of unknown etiology and it is viewed as a syndrome that likely encompasses different disorders that have in common the reduction of CD4 cell number. There is evidence for increased activation and turnover of CD4 T cells in patients with ICL. Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> found increased levels of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and markers of CD4+ lymphocyte activation in patients with ICL. Apoptosis of CD4+ lymphocyte may be associated with enhanced expression of Fas and Fas ligand. Various other immune disorders have been described in ICL patients, including low CD8+ T cells counts and defective expression of CXCR4 on the surface of CD4+ cells. The alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cell repertoires of ICL patients are highly restricted which may suggest a defect in maturation or differentiation during T cell development and altered tyrosine kinase activity of p56. ICL has been associated with increases in immature or transitional B cells and increased serum of IL-7 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【6】ICL has been associated with a number of autoimmune conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> but, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which it is reported in patients with IgG4-related disease.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【8】On August 2007 a 43-year-old patient presented with the sudden onset of cholestatic jaundice and the radiologic detection of two pancreatic masses, diffuse lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly. To exclude the presence of a lymphoma, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. A biopsy of liver and of a lymph node at the level of hepatic hilum and cholecystectomy were performed. Biopsy of pancreatic mass was attended but, for technical reasons, not successful. Histology showed the presence of chronic cholecystitis with hypertrophic reactive lymphadenitis, fibrosis of the cystic duct with strong intramural inflammatory infiltrate, signs of portal fibrosis, and cholestasis in the absence of alterations of the biliary tract. Consequently, a bile duct-duodenal anastomosis was packed in absence of a conclusive diagnosis.\n\n【9】On March 2008, the patient presented a complex clinical picture including an interstitial pneumonitis by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, Epstein Barr and cytomegalovirus infections, tubulointerstitial nephritis, severe lymphopenia, and marked reduction of CD4 通用删除1(英):<u>(214 cells/μL, Tables 1 and 2)</u>. CT scan showed the presence of three pulmonary nodules (<1 cm), diffuse lymph node enlargement, and enlarged kidneys and spleen. Laboratory showed increased levels of ESR and CRP, hypergammaglobulinemia, positive reuma test and Waaler Rose tests, presence of serum and urinary kappa and lambda light chains, increased beta<sub>2</sub> microglobulin, and circulating C1q immunocomplexes. ANA, anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-bile canaliculi, anti-liver kidney mouse, liver western blot, anti-smooth muscle, pANCA, cANCA, anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-peroxidase were negative. Tests for leishmaniasis, toxoplasma, and HIV were also negative. The bone marrow aspirate excluded lymphoproliferative and parasitic disorders. Renal biopsy showed a tubulointerstitial nephritis with diffuse infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Arteries and arterioles were undamaged. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of CD20, CD3, and CD68. Immunostaining for kappa and lambda light chains documented a polytypic plasma cells population. Direct immunofluorescence was negative for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q, fibrinogen, kappa, and lambda light chains. Subject was treated with glucocorticoids with improvement of the symptoms and lymphopenia.\n\n【10】Table 1 Main laboratory data.\n\n【11】Table 2 Lymphocyte typing of March 2008, before steroids administration.\n\n【12】Three years later, a reduction of the number of the CD4 lymphocytes was once again reported (146/μL, CD4/CD8 ratio equal to 0.8) in conjunction with the onset of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, arthralgia, hemorrhagic rhinitis, multiple caries, and consequent extraction of 10 teeth. After the exclusion of HIV and malignancies (biopsy of an inguinal lymph node, bone marrow biopsy, and PET), an idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia was diagnosed. Nevertheless, only a part of the signs was explained by CD4 lymphocytopenia.\n\n【13】On January 2014, there was the first visit to our outpatient clinic for worsening renal function, hypocomplementemia, and polyclonal increase of IgG. CD4 lymphocytes were in the normal range.\n\n【14】The medical history of obstructive jaundice pancreatic mass and interstitial nephritis, together with a marked elevation of IgG4, was suggestive of a IgG4-related disease. At the time of our observation, ultrasound examinations showed hepatomegaly, increased volume of the kidneys with a mild dilatation of chalices and renal pelvis without signs of urinary tract obstructions, and bilateral enlargement of the submandibular glands. IgG4 were mildly elevated (185 mg/dL), ANA were negatives, and CD4 were in the normal range.\n\n【15】After 3 months of prednisone 50 mg/day, we observed an improvement of the renal function paired with a reduction of inflammation, IgG, and kidneys volume and the disappearance of the dilatation of chalices and renal pelvis.\n\n【16】At the time of the submission of the present case report, the patient, treated with prednisone 5 mg/day, is in remission with stable GFR and normalization of IgG4 and CD4 lymphocytes.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】The involvement of liver (cholestatic jaundice), pancreas (pancreatic masses and lymphadenopathy) and, subsequently, the respiratory system (interstitial pneumonia, lung nodules, and hemorrhagic rhinitis), urinary tract (tubulointerstitial nephritis with polyclonal infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, bilateral hydronephrosis), and salivary glands (bilateral enlargement of the submandibular glands, multiple caries, and consequent teeth extraction) as well as the detection of hypocomplementemia, increased polyclonal IgG and IgG4 subclass, and the rapid improvement of symptoms and laboratory data after steroid therapy are indicative of IgG4-related disease. On the other hand, the history of opportunistic infections such as CMV, EBV, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydia, in absence of HIV and malignancies, is the consequence of the idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia. Only when considered together, the IgG4-related disease and the idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia explain the clinical presentation of the subject.\n\n【19】The HISORT criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> reach a high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (97%) to select subjects with IgG4-related disease. These criteria are based on serologic, radiologic, histopathological, and clinical criteria, including the detection of the type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis, the most common sign of the IgG4-related disease, and the responsiveness to the steroids therapy. In the case reported in this paper, all of these criteria were satisfied with the notable exception of the histologic finding of the pancreas which might have confirmed the autoimmune nature of the disease.\n\n【20】The renal involvement reported in IgG4-related disease is a tubulointerstitial nephritis with polyclonal infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, a membranous nephropathy, and a calicopelvic dilatation secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15–19\\]</u>. Raissian et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> diagnostic criteria for a IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis include (a) elevated serum total IgG or IgG4 levels (>135 mg/dL); (b) plasma cell-rich tubulointerstitial nephropathy with an absolute number of IgG4 plasma cells >10/HPF, obliterative phlebitis, and storiform fibrosis; (c) increased kidney volume with wedge-shaped or patchy lesions; and (d) demonstration of a IgG4-related disease in other organs. All of these criteria were satisfied, except for the presence of IgG4 at renal biopsy which was not evaluated at time of renal biopsy. In this case, hypocomplementemia was present and it is reported in 70% of patients with IgG4-related disease. In contrast to the other subclasses, IgG4 has low affinity for Fc receptors and C1q and thus minimal ability to activate cells or initiate complement activation and has been traditionally considered to play only a limited role in immune activation. Nevertheless, in some circumstances, IgG4 can act as a rheumatoid-factor and binds the Fc portion of other IgG antibodies, in particular IgG4. This interaction occurs between Fc constant domains and may contribute to the molecule’s anti-inflammatory function. Complements levels are a helpful indicator of disease activity in patients with a IgG4-RD and renal disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The simultaneous presence of a tubulointerstitial nephritis and hypocomplementemia is a laboratory feature in IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. What is unique in this case is the description of an association of the IgG4-related disease with the idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia.\n\n【22】The ICL is commonly associated with several autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus systemic, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, Sjogren’s syndrome, polyarthritis/vasculitis, psoriasis, lichen planus, autoimmune vitiligo, Behcet syndrome, and Hashimoto thyroiditis as well as the atopic dermatitis, sarcoidosis, and idiopathic obliterative bronchiolitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which an association between the IgG4-related disease and the ICL is reported. However, the pathophysiology of both the IgG4-related disease and idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is not completely clear. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the common pathway between these diseases and, inversely, the casualty cannot be excluded. Consequently, it may be of interest to investigate further the temporal relationship of the IgG4-related disease and idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia and the exact nature of correlation of the two diagnoses.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Methodological Issues\n\n【24】The present case report describes the clinical history and follow-up of a IgG4-related disease presenting in association with an apparently idiopathic profound and recurrent decline in CD4+ cells. The major limitation of this study is that, despite the fact that both the HISORT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> and Raissian criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> required the bioptic demonstration of IgG4, these data were unavailable in our case.\n\n【25】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】In conclusion, we reported a case of a subject with a multiorgan IgG4-related disease presenting in a temporal association with a profound and symptomatic idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia.

The largely nonspecific symptoms and delayed presentation pose a serious diagnostic challenge. Medical management with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is recommended, but there are no reports of successful dual therapy. We report a case of spontaneous bilateral vertebral artery dissections (VADs) treated with both anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy and a literature review on clinical presentation and the current medical and surgical management options. A 37-year-old healthy female presented to the emergency department with worsening neck pain and headache for two weeks despite over-the-counter medication, block therapy, yoga, and deep tissue neck massage. She denied any trauma but admitted to multiple roller coaster rides over the past few months. CT angiography was concerning for VADs, and MRI brain revealed multiple strokes in the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory. Cerebral arteriography confirmed the diagnosis of VADs. The patient was initiated on warfarin, along with atorvastatin and aspirin. She was discharged home with no complications and followed up with neurology as an outpatient. MR angiography after three months revealed complete resolution of the dissection. The patient did not report any bleeding complications from dual therapy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cervical artery dissection presents at any age, with a wide range of symptoms. Although uncommon in the general population, it is a recognized cause of ischemic stroke in younger patients. The internal carotid artery is most commonly affected, but occasionally, other arteries can be involved as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The incidence of vertebral artery dissection is estimated to be 2.6–3/100 000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. According to Schievink, bilateral VAD accounts for 10 to 25% of all causes of ischemic stroke in young patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Bilateral VAD may be fatal due to the potential compromise of the posterior cerebral circulation.\n\n【4】Early diagnosis is crucial to achieve better outcomes, especially when the presentation is vague or asymptomatic. Headaches, neck pain, and dizziness are common complaints seen in young to middle age individuals presenting to outpatient clinics and emergency centers. These symptoms can be attributed to benign conditions such as migraine, tension headaches, and myofascial or musculoskeletal pain; therefore, the diagnosis of VAD is frequently missed or misdiagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A common theme amongst VAD is patients with recent minor neck trauma or maneuvers damaging the underlying cervical vessels, including chiropractic manipulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The VAD diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion combined with various imaging modalities. Therefore, this case would be of high interest to both general practitioners and emergency medicine physicians, who most frequently deal with unspecific head and neck pain. Management of VAD depends on several factors including clinical presentation, time of onset, anatomic findings, number of vessels compromised, and contraindications to specific therapies. Therapeutic options include thrombolysis, conservative management with antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents), endovascular management, and surgery. Timely diagnosis and initiation of treatment can help prevent more serious complications. Prognosis appears promising, as recurrent dissection rate after the first month is approximately 1% per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We report the case of a young female who presented 2 weeks after initiation of neck pain. The diagnosis of VAD and multiple strokes was made. We highlight our management approach and outcome. Additionally, we present a review of literature on the most common clinical presentations and management options available to date.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 37-year-old Caucasian female with a history of dyslipidemia, asthma, and fibroids presented to the emergency room reporting two weeks of bilateral posterior neck pain and headaches. She initially presented with right-sided neck pain, which she attributed to various physical activities and sleeping in uncomfortable hotel beds. Of note, she described multiple recent visits to a theme park and enjoyed numerous roller coaster rides. The pain was achy, constant in nature, extending to the back of the eyes, and rated as 4 on a 10-point scale. Her pain persisted and increased in severity despite acetaminophen use and application of heating pads. She then tried block therapy, yoga, and deep tissue neck massage. The pain then became bilateral, even more severe, followed by an episode of severe dizziness and nausea which prompted the emergency room visit. Her family history was negative for connective tissue diseases. The patient was taking oral contraceptive pills and had discontinued statin therapy a few years ago. She denied using tobacco products, illicit drugs, or excessive alcohol.\n\n【8】Initially, vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam revealed a nontoxic appearing young woman in no visible distress. Neck exam was significant for muscular tenderness but no midline or cervical spinous process tenderness. There was no rigidity, with full active and passive range of motion without pain. Brudzinski and Kernig signs were negative. The ear canals showed no abnormalities; there were no hearing deficits. No carotid bruits were present, and the neck was supple. Neurological exam revealed a normal cranial nerve exam, +5/5 muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities symmetric bilaterally, normal sensory exam, normal finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing, and no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was intact, and she had no dysarthria or nystagmus.\n\n【9】Based on her history of recent roller coaster rides, worsening neck pain after yoga, and deep tissue neck massage, the following differential diagnosis was considered: intracranial bleeding, stroke, cervical artery dissection (CAD), and cervical spondylosis. Complete blood count and urinalysis were unremarkable. Basic metabolic panel showed abnormal cholesterol levels (total cholesterol: 224 mg/dl, triglycerides: 168 mg/dl, and LDL: 131 mg/dl). Beta-HCG was <2, and troponins were negative. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm. Autoimmune and vasculitis workup showed an elevated sedimentation rate of 27 mm/hr \\[0–22 mm/hr\\] but negative antinuclear antibodies, Smith antibody, and RNA antibody. Rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein were within normal limits.\n\n【10】Chest X-ray was unremarkable. CT head/brain without IV contrast showed nonspecific left cerebellar hypodensities that may represent age-indeterminate embolic infarcts/injuries among other possible etiologies, with no acute intracranial hemorrhage 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u>. Head MRI without contrast (DWI sequence) showed large areas of acute ischemia in the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory with additional smaller areas of acute ischemia in the left superior parasagittal cerebellum. CT angiography of the head and neck with and without IV contrast demonstrated a relatively abrupt change in the caliber of the left V3 vertebral artery suggestive of dissection and a short segment high-grade narrowing of the right vertebral artery also highly suggestive of a dissection . Carotid arteries were within normal limits. Twenty-four hours after admission, the patient presented with a second episode of dizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and tingling sensation in both hands, which prompted further evaluation with the cerebral angiogram. The exam confirmed the bilateral VAD and revealed the presence of a subintimal clot on the left VA at V4 with loss of 50% of lumen , not previously observed in previous images. MR angiogram was not performed in the initial evaluation.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Noncontrast CT of the head (a) and brain MRI-DWI sequence (b) showing several well-circumscribed near fluid attenuation regions in the left cerebellum, the largest of which measures 3.5 cm transverse diameter. This is suggestive of left cerebellar ischemic stroke. There is no acute hemorrhage, midline shift, or hydrocephalus.</u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CTA shows a short segment of high-grade narrowing of the cervical right vertebral artery at the C2-3 level.</u>\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Cerebral angiography showing a dissection flap extending across the C1 loop and to the foramen magnum. Subintimal clot is seen medially in the vessel wall with 50% loss of lumen in the V4 segment. This abrupt change in the caliber of the left vertebral artery shows dissection.</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Cerebral angiography shows right vertebral artery dissection right past the C3 level at which a small pseudoaneurysm is noted in the artery anterior wall. This pseudoaneurysm tapers into the dissection which extends just beyond the C2 loop. There is marked reduction in luminal diameter and noticeable delay in antegrade flow distal to the dissection.</u>\n\n【15】The patient was evaluated conjointly with neurology, neurosurgery, and interventional neuroradiology. Upon diagnosis of bilateral VADs, all consultants unanimously recommended systemic anticoagulation for 3–6 months and repeat imaging in 3 months to evaluate for healing. The patient was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy given the time of presentation and NIHSS of 0. Intravenous heparin at 1,000 units/hr without initial bolus and close monitoring was preferred over standard therapy due to the high risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Additionally, aspirin and atorvastatin were also started. The patient developed mild vaginal bleeding upon discontinuation of birth control pills. The episode stopped shortly after and no interventions were needed. Mirena intrauterine device was recommended should the bleeding worsen while on anticoagulation but was never placed as the bleeding stopped shortly after.\n\n【16】A second neurology opinion, obtained per patient request, recommended to continue systemic anticoagulation for 3–6 months along with aspirin and atorvastatin. The patient was continued on IV heparin and titrated carefully for activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) goal of 50–55 seconds. She was given aspirin 325 mg daily initially and then decreased to aspirin 81 mg when aPTT became therapeutic. Atorvastatin 10 mg was continued throughout the hospital stay, without complication. The patient was eventually bridged to warfarin with an international normalized ratio (INR) goal of 2–3 with intention to continue for 3–6 months. At discharge, the patient continued with both low dose aspirin and warfarin without complications or neurological deficits. She follows up with neurology as outpatient. INR was monitored biweekly and remained within therapeutic range throughout the 3 months. MR angiography after three months showed complete resolution of the dissection . The patient did not report any bleeding complications from dual therapy.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 MR angiogram at 3-month follow-up showed complete resolution of bilateral dissection.</u>\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Literature Review\n\n【19】A systematic review through PubMed was conducted without any restrictions. We used the keywords: “bilateral,” “vertebral artery,” and “dissection.” The reference sections of the eligible results were screened for any potential missed cases of relevance to ensure the inclusion of all reported cases of bilateral vertebral artery dissection. Our search yielded one hundred and one manuscripts. Exclusion criteria included artery transections, unilateral dissections, dissection secondary to known aneurysms, congenital or acquired vasculopathies, dissection in arteries with anomalous origin, patients with connective tissue disorders, cases presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage, pediatric patients, patients with chromosopathies, articles other than case reports or case series, and articles not available in English. Thirty-two manuscripts describing cases of bilateral vertebral artery dissection in patients were included in our review and are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【20】Table 1 Reported cases of bilateral vertebral artery dissection.\n\n【21】In our review, the age of presentation ranged between 23 and 52 years old. Of the thirty-two cases, eighteen (56.2%) were female patients. These baseline characteristics were consistent with previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 14\\]</u>. Among the identifiable risk factors for vertebral dissection, we found five patients presenting with associated comorbidities: one patient with chronic hypertension, three with a history of migraines, and one with acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 17\\]</u>. The remaining cases were otherwise healthy young adults. Thirteen cases of bilateral VA dissection (40.6%) presented spontaneously and without an identifiable trigger. Among those with a potential source of trauma, 6 patients were associated with chiropractic manipulation (Cases 1a, 4, 13, 17, 21, and 28), 6 to motor vehicle accident (Cases 3, 5, 6a, 11, and 12), 4 to sports with or without direct trauma (Cases 10, 14, 22, and 26), and one case followed 2 weeks postpartum (Case 25). Similar to our case, there were 2 cases associated with recent use of roller coasters (Cases 16 and 19).\n\n【22】The most common clinical presentations were occipital headache, unilateral or bilateral neck pain, and vertebrobasilar symptoms (dizziness, nausea, and vertigo). Two patients with multivessel compromise that included bilateral internal carotid artery dissection also presented with monocular vision loss or gaze deviation (Cases 19 and 25). The least common presentations were three cases of locked-in syndrome, one case of Horner syndrome, and one case of Brown-Sequard syndrome (Cases 3, 5, 6, and 9). In these cases, there was an extended compromise of the basilar artery, bilateral internal carotid arteries, or thoracic vertebral artery. Of all reported cases, one patient died 2 weeks after the development of symptoms (Case 1b).\n\n【23】Anticoagulation therapy with heparin was started in all nonsurgical patients once any contraindications were ruled out. One patient with extensive compromise of the posterior circulation required immediate thrombolytic therapy (Case 22). In this case, clinical deterioration followed, and the patient underwent suction thrombectomy 24 hours later. Follow-up 12 months after surgery showed clinical improvement with residual right incomplete hemianopsia. In another patient, stent placement was indicated given multiple vessel involvement, severe compromise of posterior circulation, and high risk of distal embolization (Case 25).\n\n【24】At discharge, most patients continued anticoagulation with warfarin for at least 3 months. The addition of other drugs and duration of treatment were variable. Chakrapi et al. reported use of prolonged anticoagulation with warfarin for six months, clopidogrel for eighteen months, and aspirin indefinitely. For most cases, follow-ups 3 to 6 months after the initial episode showed clinical improvement and partial to complete resolution of the arterial dissections.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【26】We report a case of bilateral VAD with embolic strokes in a young woman presenting with worsening posterior neck pain, headaches, and vertigo. We suspect that exposure to constant repetitive microtrauma during roller coaster rides may have caused the dissections, with subsequent deep tissue massage and block yoga mobilizing intramural thrombus causing the subclinical strokes.\n\n【27】Neck pain remains a very common complaint among patients. Approximately 10% of adults experience neck pain at any time, but only about 1% will develop further neurologic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Common causes of neck pain include cervical strain, internal disc disruption, cervical facet-mediated pain, “whiplash” syndrome, and myofascial pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Clinical symptoms that are persistent, worsening, or are associated with neurological deficits may suggest more serious causes.\n\n【28】An arterial dissection can occur at any age, and it is a recognized cause of stroke, especially in younger patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. The false lumen produced by the dissection can cause luminal stenosis or thrombosis, compromising the blood flow. A retrospective study of patients with cervical artery dissections found that, in patients with acute stroke, 85% was attributed to the thromboembolic mechanism, while only 12% was attributed to hypoperfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. In young adults, the cases of nontraumatic bilateral cervicocephalic artery dissections are less common but not rare. About 5–10% of carotid and 38% of VAD are bilateral. In a case series, bilateral spontaneous dissection was found in 8.1% of all patients with VAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.\n\n【29】In a review of 83 patients with unilateral vertebral artery dissection, without consciousness disturbance at admission, unilateral or bilateral headache was the most common complaint (60 cases), followed by neck pain (41 cases), and vertigo (20 cases). Statistically, unilateral headache and/or neck pain was more common in cases with definite vertebral artery dissection compared with other classifications per the Spontaneous Cervicocephalic Arterial Dissections Study () 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. In the thirty-two cases of bilateral VAD we reviewed, 62.5% (20 patients) presented with either head or neck pain as the chief complaint. Ten cases reported involvement of other vessels: bilateral internal carotid in Cases 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 15; basilar artery in Cases 15 and 18; and multiple vessels in Cases 9 and 22. Therefore, medullary and pontine symptoms such as vertigo, dysphagia, and Horner syndrome predominated in these cases.\n\n【30】An analysis of a national trauma database showed that VADs only comprised 0.01% of all patients admitted with head and neck trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. Observational studies have produced a list of mild mechanical triggering events. Relevant to our case, amusement park rides have been implicated in VADs. Schneck et al. reported a case of a 34-year-old female who was misdiagnosed with labyrinthitis after presenting to her primary care physician complaining of vertigo. She had recently been to a national amusement park where she went on all but one ride. Similar to our case, the patient developed neck pain uncontrolled with analgesics and subsequently developed neurologic symptoms of blurry vision. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed bilateral VAD without infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Our patient’s dissection was complicated by multiple strokes, most notably in the left PICA territory but fortunately without any evidence of Wallenberg syndrome, Horner syndrome, or gait disturbances.\n\n【31】Multiple dissections are more frequently found in women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Arnold et al. used prospective hospital-based registries to identify risk factors and outcomes in patients with spontaneous cervical artery dissections. They found that 1.5% of patients had multiple dissections, and the majority was women. Additionally, these patients did not have any family history of such dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, or connective tissue disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. This is similar to our patient who had two dissections on imaging and no identifiable risk factors.\n\n【32】Traditionally, VADs are classified as extracranial and intracranial. Extracranial dissections in the hyperacute period can be treated with thrombolytic therapy. Outside said period, antithrombotic therapy with either single or dual antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents is the treatment of choice. VAD management remains challenging as there are no conclusive treatment guidelines. Anticoagulation therapy is controversial in intracranial dissections given the theoretical higher risk of bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Per the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, antithrombotic treatment with an anticoagulant or platelet inhibitor for at least 3–6 months is reasonable for patients with extracranial carotid or vertebral artery dissection associated with ischemic stroke or TIA (level of evidence: B) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>. However, there is no clear consensus regarding management for the use of anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy, or both, in patients without atherosclerotic disease in vertebral artery dissection.\n\n【33】Most recently, the CADISS trial compared antiplatelet treatment with anticoagulant treatment for extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection. It showed that recurrent stroke at 3 months is rare, with no significant difference between the two treatment groups. Although more strokes occurred in the antiplatelet group, this difference was counterbalanced by one major subarachnoid hemorrhage in the anticoagulant group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. Based on these results and several retrospective studies, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends either antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy for 3 to 6 months in patients with CAD-associated ischemic stroke (class of recommendation IIa, level of evidence B-NR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>. Some authors may favor antiplatelet treatment given its safer profile and the risk of warfarin inducing expansion of the intramural hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50\\]</u>. However, this and other complications such as hemorrhagic transformation are rare events. Our literature review indicates that most physicians gravitate towards early anticoagulation with heparin and then transitioning to oral warfarin. This action may be supported by the theoretical benefit of anticoagulation in the prevention of occlusion of a stenotic vessel and minimization of distal embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46, 51, 52\\]</u>.\n\n【34】The combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy is controversial, as it increases the hemorrhagic risk. However, even in the setting of hemorrhagic transformation, antithrombotic therapy could be continued based on the individual risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>. In this patient, we took into consideration her past medical history (dyslipidemia and recent OCP use), low risk of bleeding (Has-bled score of 2), the high grade, bilateral compromise of the vertebral arteries, presence of a subintimal clot in close proximity to the basilar artery, and acute embolic strokes. Our approach allowed for management of her risk factors, prevention of recurrent strokes, and potential lethal compromise of the basilar artery by distal embolization. In this particular case, the authors concluded that the benefits of such therapy outweighed the risks. To our knowledge, this is the first report of dual antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy in bilateral VAD. The patient was closely monitored in a neurologic progressive unit with serial neurovascular assessment without any eventualities. Upon discharge, she continued with the same regiment, and no adverse events were reported.\n\n【35】There are no concrete data on the ideal duration of antithrombotic therapy. Current recommendation is to continue antithrombotic therapy for 3 to 6 months, as the vessel heals. Further treatment should be tailored based on imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Chakrapi et al. reported one case of bilateral ICA and VA dissection that was managed with prolonged anticoagulation therapy plus dual antiplatelet therapy. At 6 months follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, and warfarin was discontinued. The 1-year CT scan results showed residual dissection of 30% in the right ICA and persistent 30 to 50% dissection in both VA. For these reasons, the patient continued clopidogrel for 12 months (18 months in total since the episode) and aspirin indefinitely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Some studies are proposing the use of new oral anticoagulant agents (NOAC) as an attractive therapeutic alternative. A recent retrospective observational study compared the use of NOAC to conventional anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in patients with CAD. The results show that NOAC have similar rate of recurrence of stroke, lower risk of major bleeding, but higher risk for radiologic worsening than conventional anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies. Additionally, two case reports showed complete resolution of the lesion at 3 and 6 months follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53, 54\\]</u>. In one of the reports, there were two cases of minor bleeding (hemorrhoidal and metrorrhagia), none of which required discontinuation of therapy.\n\n【37】NOAC have been found safer than warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[55\\]</u>. In addition to their safety profile, NOAC may be a more attractive choice for younger patients who are socially active, as there is no need for continuous monitoring of medication or interference with diet and lifestyle. On the contrary, titration is required in older patients with renal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. However, randomized clinical trials should be conducted to determine if NOAC are effective and safe in this population.\n\n【38】Endovascular management (EM) is considered in patients with progression of disease despite antithrombotic treatment, those presenting with pseudoaneurysm or in those not amenable for anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50\\]</u>. The safety and efficacy of EM have been explored in several retrospective studies, with overall good outcome profiles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57, 58\\]</u>. In a retrospective study, 140 patients with CAD were treated with stent placement. In the follow-up period, imaging showed improvement of the vascular stenosis. Additionally, only 1.4% of the patients presented with stroke events after the intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>. A meta-analysis of 39 retrospective studies involving different treatment modalities for VADs in adults was done to determine clinical outcomes of patients who were treated endovascularly. Overall, 75.11% had excellent outcomes, 10.10% had good outcomes, and 13.70% had poor outcomes. Of significance, postoperative complications occurred in 10.52%, with 2.73% exhibiting vasospasm, 3.03% experiencing postoperative rebleeding, and 6.31% developing ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. While most studies showed clinical and radiologic improvement of the vascular lesion and an acceptable rate of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>, conservative medical management remains the treatment of choice. Current indications for EM in CAD include recurrent ischemic events, high-grade arterial stenosis dissection with significantly limited flow, expanding pseudoaneurysm associated with dissection and occlusion, and failed medical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>. Surgical treatment may be indicated when the patient presents with recurrent strokes despite medical treatment and failed or not a candidate for endovascular therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.\n\n【39】In our review, two patients required surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31, 60\\]</u>. The first patient presented with worsening symptoms 24 hr after thrombolytic therapy, requiring suction thrombectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>. The second patient had dissection of multiple cervical vessels and severe compromise of the posterior circulation. For these reasons, three overlapping stents were placed in each vertebral artery. Both patients recovered successfully with minimal sequelae. When choosing a treatment modality, whether it is operative versus nonoperative, complications for each should be taken into careful consideration.\n\n【40】Per AHA guidelines, the management of additional risk factors should take place as soon as possible. Dyslipidemia is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor, and its management with statins has become a staple in ischemic strokes secondary to atherosclerotic disease. The role of dyslipidemia in the pathophysiology of artery dissection is less clear. Gupta et al. reported that traumatic dissections of the cervical arteries are more likely to occur in a vessel exposed to vascular risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>, and Yamada et al. reported correlation between dyslipidemia and vascular repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u>. However, most patients with VAD are young and present without classic cardiovascular risk factors. We considered statin therapy appropriate in this patient given her particular risk factors (history of dyslipidemia and traumatic VAD).\n\n【41】There are not any evidence-based recommendations on the restrictions or continuation of physical activity after an episode of CAD. Although participation in sports has been reported in many cases, causation has not been demonstrated. The recurrence of CAD is uncommon, with a reported incidence of 2% within the first month of the event and a year incidence of 1% after that 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63\\]</u>. This information is insufficient to draw any conclusions regarding the role of physical activity in the recurrence of CAD. Some experts recommend patients with dissection to avoid contact sports, chiropractic manipulation, and activities that involve abrupt mobilization of the neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Prospective studies to determine the effect of different levels of physical activity on the recurrence of CAD may be unfeasible, given the low rate of recurrence. In this case, the patient was advised to avoid any contact sports, manipulation of the neck, yoga, and roller coasters.\n\n【42】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【43】This case was written to raise awareness for health care providers, especially general practitioners and emergency department physicians, regarding injuries in the adult population after amusement park rides and/or other physical activities which involve excessive, forceful, or repetitive movements of the neck. We report a case of bilateral VAD complicated by embolic strokes in a young patient presenting with worsening posterior neck pain and headaches. These general complaints are unspecific and common in previously healthy patients. This diagnostic challenge requires an astute clinician to combine symptoms with key historical elements. Since patients can present immediately after the event or several days later when conservative management has been unsuccessful, it is imperative to keep a broad differential diagnosis in patients with neck pain that is nonresponsive to initial conservative management. We insist on the importance of high clinical suspicion to facilitate an early diagnosis.\n\n【44】Management-wise, most cases treated with anticoagulation therapy resolve in the following six to twelve months period without major neurologic deficits, especially in absence of intracranial vessel compromise. There is no consensus on whether antiplatelet therapy is superior to anticoagulation therapy, but current evidence favors the use of antiplatelets in the cases of intracranial dissection and extracranial dissection without ischemic symptoms. If there is evidence of thrombus or severe vessel occlusion, anticoagulation therapy may be preferred in order to prevent distal embolization. Our review showed that most physicians opt for anticoagulation with heparin during the intrahospital stay and bridge to warfarin at discharge. Antithrombotic therapy duration has not been defined yet, but it is usually carried for 3 to 6 months or until evidence of a well-established healing or resolution of the dissection. Reports on the use of NOAC show initial positive outcomes, but larger prospective studies are required before reaching definitive conclusions. The addition of other drugs such as atorvastatin, aspirin, or clopidogrel is left to the physician’s discretion and the patient's individual risk factors. Successful management with endovascular and surgical procedures has been reported in several cases, but their safety and efficacy are yet to be proven in randomized clinical trials. There are not any evidence-based recommendations on the restrictions or continuation of physical activity after an episode of CAD. Experts’ advice is to avoid contact sports, high-risk activities, and neck manipulation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Although pregnancy-associated pyogenic sacroiliitis rarely occurs, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A timely diagnosis of the disease is challenging due to its nonspecific clinical symptoms. We reviewed a case that experienced an acute illness during pregnancy. The illness was manifested by localized pain in the hips or buttocks, sacroiliac joint tenderness, and debilitating hip pain during ambulation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed little joint involvement, and the patient was treated with antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and glucocorticoids. The patient responded well to the therapy with marked improvement in her ambulation. Septic sacroiliitis should be considered in peripartum patients presenting with increased inflammatory markers and severe localized pain. Medical management is usually curative and without an adverse effect on pregnancy. Although we could not perform a biopsy to verify the cause of the disease, the patient’s excellent response to the treatment confirmed our diagnosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hip and low back pain (LBP) frequently occur during pregnancy with a prevalence ranging from 30% to 78% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Pain may originate from the lumbar region, hip, or sacroiliac joint (SIJ). LBP or buttocks usually has a nonspecific etiology and a self-limited course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The risk factors for LBP include pelvic trauma, low age, multiparous, chronic LBP, and history of LBP in the previous pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】However, certain conditions complicate the diagnosis, such as transient hip osteoporosis, hip avascular necrosis, sacral stress fracture, and sacroiliitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The sacroiliac joint disease usually presents with LBP that increases with ambulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although most cases represent nonspecific arthritis, the sacroiliac joint can be seeded after bacteremia, resulting in a pyogenic course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】This complication is prevalent in injection drug users, although it may develop after any bacteremia. If the disease develops during pregnancy, it may pose a diagnostic challenge, as pain in the low back and buttocks is common and often nonspecific during pregnancy and the postpartum period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The incidence of pregnancy-associated sacroiliitis is low, with less than 20 cases reported in the literature occurring during pregnancy, during the puerperium, or after an abortion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The pathophysiology of pregnancy-associated sacroiliitis may involve relaxation of pelvic ligaments during pregnancy, resulting in increases in pelvic movements and thus microtrauma to the joint surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Therefore, the physician may be susceptible to any transient bacteremia occurring in the context of pregnancy-induced immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Here, we reported a case of pregnancy-associated inflammatory sacroiliitis, which is rare and often underrecognized in daily clinical practice.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 24-year-old pregnant woman with a gestational age of about 35 weeks herself referred to an orthopedic emergency department. The patient suffered from sharp severe hip joint pain for a week. She was referred to a maternity hospital with a diagnosis of septic arthritis. After admission, the pain developed suddenly and radiated down to her right thigh. The pain was worsening over time. She regularly used local dairy products and did not take any specific medications. She had a successful vaginal delivery previously. A day after hospitalization, the labor pain began, and the vaginal delivery was conducted in the first hours of admission in the labor ward due to spontaneous labor pain. She suffered from pelvic pain and motion limitation of the hip, especially during the second stage of the delivery. The vaginal delivery had no dystocia regardless of the mother’s pelvic pain. The newborn had a normal Apgar score (9/10). She was unable to ambulate postpartum due to excruciating hip pain. She had anorexia, chill and malaise, low-grade fever, and mild respiratory issues. She was hemodynamically stable in a normal range.\n\n【10】Urine and blood were collected and revealed an infective bladder, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), negative rheumatoid factor (RF), negative 2-mercaptoethanol test (2 ME), negative blood culture (B/C), negative HIV, negative viral hepatitis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 通用删除7(英):<u>(135)</u>. A chest X-ray was performed, and it was normal. A hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperlaxity of muscles around the right hip joint without evidence of bone damage. Mild collection of hematoma was noted, and the right sacroiliac joint showed fluid collection measuring 14 × 14 mm. The hips, femoral heads, and acetabulums were intact and showed normal congruency.\n\n【11】Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast revealed normal lumbar spines. A pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and demonstrated an abnormal right sacroiliac joint signal sacroiliac joint (SIJ). SIG enhancement was revealed, which is in favor of arthritis. Empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy was administered to cover urinary tract infection (UTI), which was presumed to be the infection source. She was transferred to the rheumatology department for further treatment. The follow-up with her treating specialist revealed that she had improved significantly and regained her ability to function normally. She was discharged for a further follow-up of 10–20 days. An examination under anesthesia revealed no evidence of a perinatal abscess. On day 6 postpartum, blood cultures and a perinatal wound swab had grown group A Streptococcus (pyogenic); thus, her antibiotic regimen was rationalized to intravenous benzylpenicillin. However, she continued to have a fever and debilitating hip pain during ambulation.\n\n【12】Furthermore, cultures of urine, blood, and perinatal swabs were negative, and a color Doppler ultrasound excluded pelvic deep venous thrombosis. On day 12 postpartum, she underwent a pelvic MRI scan, which revealed bilateral sacroiliitis with a right-sided sacroiliac joint collection . It was subsequently drained under computed tomography (CT) guidance, yielding 1 mL of purulent fluid and dramatically improving the patient’s symptoms. She was discharged home on day 15 on a four-week intravenous benzylpenicillin course, followed by a six-week oral amoxicillin course.\n\n【13】After discharge, she was followed up and her gait and pain reduced day by day, and by the fourth week, her pain completely faded away.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a)-(b) Bilateral sacroiliitis with the right sacroiliac joint collection.</u>\n\n【15】An internal medicine physician observed her for two months after discharge from the hospital and prescribed her nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) (ibuprofen 200 mg three times a day) and pregabalin (75 mg twice a day) for 4 weeks after discharging from the hospital. She showed full recovery and was found to ambulate freely with no sign of discomfort in her sacroiliac joint. The laboratory findings during admission and cure are given in Table 1.\n\n【16】Table 1 The diagnosis test and inflammatory markers.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】The sacroiliac joint is a nonweight-bearing joint with a small range of motion that has to endure extra burden during pregnancy due to biomechanical changes, leading to pubic instability, inflammation, bone edema, and stress fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The latter can quickly occur if there is insufficient bone mass due to osteopenia or vitaminD deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】This case had severe pain, and her CRP was very high, leading us to include pyogenic sacroiliitis in the entry diagnosis. Pyogenic sacroiliitis may be accompanied by a history of intravenous drug abuse, infective endocarditis, urinary tract infection, abortion, or delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 11\\]</u>. However, infections play an important role in this disease. The primary causative organisms are groups A and B Streptococci and Staphylococcus species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is particularly important due to its mortality rate of 20–25%, a consequence of the toxic shock-like syndrome triggered by its exotoxin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. GAS can also cause rapid bone and joint destruction, resulting in chronic disability for survivors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Although the timely diagnosis of pyogenic sacroiliitis is critical, it presents a diagnostic challenge. Moreover, one-third of patients with pyogenic sacroiliitis have a normal white cell count and are afebrile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The most valuable investigations to establish this diagnosis are inflammatory markers, including almost universally elevated ESR and CRP levels, occasionally positive blood and urine cultures, and pelvic MRI. Bone edema, sclerosis, and erosions in SIJ are typical radiological changes similar to those in postpartum sacroiliitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Moreover, our case had a sign of upper tract infection. There were high ESR and CRP in her laboratory findings, which are in line with our diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Empiric antibiotic regimens include vancomycin in combination with a third or fourth-generation cephalosporin (such as ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or cefepime) and metronidazole. An alternative regimen consisting of vancomycin in combination with a 6 carbapenem is useful for coverage of staphylococci, Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. Most patients remit completely in five months, but about 10% of them may experience more chronic persistent arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】Hip and LBP are frequent during pregnancy or the postpartum period. A careful analysis of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings may help clinicians detect their underlying cause and tailor appropriate treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We present the case of a 16-year-old male who presented with low back pain in 2015. He was a high school soccer player with a previous history of a bilateral L5 lumbar spondylolysis in 2014. The patient refrained from soccer and wore a brace for six months. Two months after restarting soccer, he again complained of low back pain. After 1 year, a lumbar spine computed tomography revealed the bone union of the spondylolysis. At his first visit to our hospital, his general and neurological conditions were normal and laboratory data were within the normal range. Sacral coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left sacral ala revealed an oblique lineal signal void surrounding bone marrow edema. Based on his symptoms, sports history, and MRI, he was diagnosed with a sacral stress fracture. He again refrained from soccer; his low back pain soon improved, and, after 1 year, the abnormal signal change had disappeared on sacral MRI. Recurrent low back pain case caused by a sacral stress fracture occurring after the bone union of lumbar spondylolysis is uncommon.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Lumbar spondylolysis is the most significant cause of low back pain in high school and college football players 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Lumbar spondylolysis is considered to be a form of stress fracture, the development of which is frequently associated with vigorous sports activities during the growth period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In an early stage of lumbar spondylolysis, an orthosis leads to bone union 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Matheson et al. reported that, among 320 athletes with a bone scan-positive stress fracture, a pelvic fracture was reported in only five cases (1.6%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

We present the case of a patient with a sacral stress fracture following the bone union of lumbar spondylolysis and report on the radiological findings and treatment course. We considered the two stress fractures (lumbar spondylolysis and sacral stress fracture) causing low back pain that happened in one patient to be a very rare condition. The patient and his family gave consent to submit these data for publication.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 16-year-old male presented to our hospital with low back pain. He was a soccer player and had a history of lumbar spondylolysis that had been conservatively treated by a previous doctor. A period of rest and wearing a brace were advised in 2014. A lumbar computed tomography (CT) scan at his first visit to a previous doctor’s clinic indicated that there were bilateral fracture lines in the L5 isthmus 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a)–1(c))</u>. His low back pain soon improved, and, after 10 months, he started playing soccer again in 2015. However, 2 months later, his low back pain recurred, and a 1-year follow-up lumbar CT indicated that his spondylolysis had united without displacement 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a)–2(c))</u>.

There was no inflammatory reaction and infectious diseases were excluded.\n\n【13】Table 1 Laboratory data.\n\n【14】##### 2.3. Radiological Findings\n\n【15】Sacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained by the previous doctor showed a low-intensity T1-weighted image of the left second sacral ala and a high-intensity T2-weighted image and a short TI inversion recovery (STIR) image (bone marrow edema) compared with the right side. An oblique low lineal appearance could be seen in the bone marrow edema 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a)–3(d))</u>.

Discussion\n\n【21】Kaneko et al. identified seven (2.3%) fractures in 311 sports-related low back pain cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. We reviewed 46 detailed case reports of sacral stress fractures of which 15 cases were male and 31 cases were female . The average age was 21.9 years (range 9–46 years). The right side was affected in 23 cases and the left side in 22 cases and one case was bilateral. Reported sports were long-distance running, cross-country running, basketball, and soccer. Our case can be included here as a proper sacral stress fracture.\n\n【22】Table 2 Review of reports.\n\n【23】In previous reports, the diagnosis of a sacral stress fracture was made based on a sports history and radiological findings. The reported main radiological methods were a bone scintigram and MRI. According to Grier et al. suggestive MRI findings of a fatigue fracture were a central lineal signal void on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences surrounded by diffuse low marrow signals on T1 images and increased signals on T2 images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Previous studies that documented a sacral stress fracture reported MRI findings with a lineal low-intensity appearance in the high signal intensity area on T2-weighted sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 10, 11, 14, 17–20, 22–26\\]</u>. The MRI findings of this case were compatible based on the radiological findings of previous reports.\n\n【24】While 22 articles have reported on sacral stress fractures, some authors reported a sacral stress fracture as an uncommon injury, although it is not rare based on the number of previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–26\\]</u>. The common criteria regarding a sacral stress fracture were young healthy athletes, MRI and/or bone scintigraphy as a diagnostic tool, and pain relief upon cessation of sports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–26\\]</u>. Based on the previous reports, we considered that complicated diagnosis and easy improvement by rest left sacral stress fracture not diagnosed and made it a not well-known disease for orthopedic doctors.\n\n【25】In our review of 37 cases of sacral stress fracture including descriptions of a past stress fracture , five cases had a previous history of a stress fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 12, 14, 17, 18\\]</u>.

Myiasis is rarely manifested in the urogenital system. Herein, we report a case of urogenital myiasis in a 49-year-old rural woman complaining of maggots in the urine and severe genital itching.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The term myiasis is derived from the Greek root mya meaning flight and was coined by Hope FW in 1840 when describing the infestation of living vertebrae with dipterous larvae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This condition involves the infestation of living vertebrae with dipterous maggot larvae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Human myiasis (HM) is globally reported and is mostly prevalent among families with a poor socioeconomic status residing in tropical regions. It is, however, not limited to these regions and manifests as a global agricultural concern when occurring in domestic animals. In humans, this condition is usually induced by parasites related to an animal host. Cutaneous myiasis is the most prevalent clinical form of the condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Nasopharyngeal myiasis involves the infection of the nose, mouth, sinuses, and ears. Other forms include ocular myiasis (ophthalmomyiasis) and intestinal myiasis due to the ingestion of the organism. Vaginal and urogenital myiasis is rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Herein, we present a case of urogenital myiasis in a 49-year-old woman.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 49-year-old rural woman presented three days ago to our Charity Clinic, complaining of maggots in the urine and severe genital itching. Her family occupation was farming and animal (sheep, goats, and cows) husbandry, and they had a relatively low economic status.\n\n【6】She reported foul-smelling vaginal discharge for the past six months but had not visited the clinic due to fear of social stigma. She reported no history of underlying diseases, trauma, or insect bite to the vaginal area. She did not smoke cigarettes but used hookah. In the past six months, the patient did not have sexual intercourse and had regular menstruation.\n\n【7】She reported wearing underpants and skirts. The physical exam revealed erythema in the labia major and around the groins due to severe itching. In the vaginal exam, inflammation and a large number of maggots were observed in the urethral meatus, labia minora, and vaginal canal, progressing to near the cervix. Still, the cervix seemed intact on colposcopy. Infection and necrosis were observed in the labia minora due to the existence of larvae that ate away at the tissues. No significant lymphadenopathy was observed. Many maggots were sampled for microscopical examination. About 50-60 maggots were separated from the labia minora and about 10 from the vaginal canal. Blood (WBC: 9.2/mm<sup>3</sup>, Hgb: 14gr/dl) and stool test results were normal, but urine analysis reported a large number of larvae (a maximum size of 4 mm) without RBC or WBC. The morphology of the larvae was compatible with flies (family Insect) . The patient could not afford an entomological examination of the parasite. Cystoscopy was requested to examine bladder and urinary tract infection. Cystoscopy revealed gross erosion and burrowing of the left lateral urethral wall, and large clots embedded with maggots were identified within the bladder lumen.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Urine analysis reported a large number of larvae (a maximum size of 4 mm) without RBC or WBC. The morphology of the larvae was compatible with flies.</u>\n\n【9】The bladder was quickly rinsed, and a Foley catheter was placed for one week. About 30 maggots were removed after rinsing the urinary tract. To remove the maggots possibly existing deep into the vaginal tissue, 15% chloroform in paraffin oil was used to rinse the patient’s vagina for 48 hours. The infected and necrotic parts of the labia minor were debrided. To prevent reinfection and secondary bacteremia, the patient was treated with amoxicillin, clavulanic acid (1.2 g twice a day), and metronidazole (500 mg three times a day) for one week. She was admitted to the gynecology ward for one week. Upon discharge, she was recommended to keep her vagina and living environment clean and not to wear skirts when working at the farm or with animals. Two weeks later, cystoscopy results were normal, the infected parts of the labia minora were improved, and no maggots were found in the vaginal exam.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Myiasis is an ectoparasitic infection of humans and vertebrae, the most prevalent form of which is cutaneous myiasis. Nasopharyngeal myiasis involves the infection of the nose, mouth, sinuses, and ears. Other forms of this condition include ophthalmomyiasis, intestinal myiasis, and urogenital myiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Infestation with larvae can be caused by obligate or facultative parasites. When dipterous larvae enter the human tissue, they follow three stages of growth and feeding, after which they transform into pupa and then to mature flies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. Cochliomyia hominivorax, Chrysomya bezziana, and W. magnifica are the most prevalent flies causing obligatory human wounds worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Urogenital myiasis constitutes only 0.7% of human infestations, with very few cases reported so far 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 8\\]</u>. A recent systematic review found the vagina as the most prevalent site of female urogenital myiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our case, myiasis involved the labia minora, urinary bladder, urethral meatus, and vaginal canal. Therefore, the flies may lay their eggs near the urethra, and then, the larvae hatch and migrate to the bladder.\n\n【13】The risk factors of external urogenital myiasis include a low socioeconomic status, inappropriate health conditions, poor mental and physical health, a lack of personal hygiene, cervical cancer, urinary tract stents, and sexually transmitted infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Treatment aims to clean the tissue from larvae. Sometimes, manual pressure is enough for cutaneous myiasis, which is usually performed before visiting the doctor. Surgery is almost always indicated for the migratory form of the disease. The general myiasis management protocol includes the mechanical removal of all the visible larvae, followed by debridement and, occasionally, rinsing with disinfectant solutions and bandaging, until all the maggots are removed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The use of 15% chloroform in olive or other oils, or even ether, demobilizes the larvae. In our patient, the vagina was rinsed with 15% chloroform in liquid paraffin for 2 days.\n\n【15】Myiasis can be prevented by using DEET (chemical name, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) containing pesticides and mosquito nets. Ironing is an effective method for killing the eggs. Other preventive measures include wearing long-sleeved clothes to cover the wounds and not sleeping outdoors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

A nonfunctional AH was incidentally discovered in a 59-year-old morbidly obese female patient with a 10-year history of hypertension and thyroidectomy. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a left suprarenal mass of ∼16 cm in diameter. While the patient had no clinical manifestations from the hemangioma, all laboratory tests were within the normal values with no indication of a functional adrenal tumor. The mass was removed by open left adrenalectomy. The microscopic histological examination revealed a laminated structure with wide blood-filled spaces with a central core of necrotic and hemorrhagic changes, characteristic of a cavernous AH with the presence of a rare Liesegang ring. Conclusion. Although rare, AH should be considered as a differential diagnosis for adrenal masses. This is the first reported case of a cavernous AH with rare microscopic findings of the Liesegang ring.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Benign vascular tumor-like growths are commonly seen in the liver and skin tissues. However, the presence of a vascular tumor, cavernous hemangioma, in the adrenal glands is a rare incidental finding often discovered on radiologic imaging (abdominal CT, MRI, or ultrasonography) or autopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Adrenal hemangioma (AH) is a rare benign nonfunctioning tumor developing from the vascular endothelium of the adrenal gland. The first clinical case of the adrenal cavernous hemangioma was published by Johnson and Jeppesen in 1955 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This was a patient presenting with a complaint of sudden-onset hypertension and no symptoms of endocrinal origin. Despite being a rare occurrence, the potential accompanying endocrinal manifestations make it imperative to study the tumor and identify its characteristic features that may help in making a diagnosis.\n\n【4】Usually unilateral, AH is observed later in life (after the fifth decade) with female preponderance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. We report a case of an incidental adrenal hemangioma with a rare microscopic finding of the Liesegang ring found on the abdominal computed tomography (CT) of a 59-year-old female patient.\n\n【5】There are about 73 case reports of AH available from the year 1955 to date. Evidence of Liesegang ring has been reported with fibrotic, cystic, necrosed, or inflamed tissue of the skin, conjunctiva, female genital tract, or kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Liesegang rings are formed as a result of precipitation occurring over time in highly saturated solutions. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of AH with histological evidence of a Liesegang ring. Following the case report, the authors also present a brief and comprehensive review of the reported cases of AH so far.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 59-year-old morbidly obese lady with a history of essential hypertension for ten years and hypothyroidism was referred to the urology department because of an incidental finding of a huge left suprarenal mass on the abdominal CT scan. The patient had no other complaints or clinical signs that may be attributed to adrenal (medullary or cortical) overactivity, and the physical examination had no abnormality. Laboratory tests, including urine tests for 24-hour fractionated metanephrine, were within normal limits.\n\n【8】Pre- and postcontrast abdominal CT scans  revealed a large heterogeneous solid left adrenal gland mass with internal calcifications and central necrosis. Postcontrast showed peripheral nodular discontinuous enhancement . The mass caused a significant mass effect on the left kidney, which is pushed inferiorly.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Pre- and postcontrast CT scan of the abdomen: large heterogeneous solid left adrenal mass (M) with internal calcifications and peripheral discontinuous enhancement after contrast (arrows in B and D). Note. Significant mass effect of the left kidney which is pushed inferiorly.</u>\n\n【10】The mass was removed through an open approach via a supraumbilical midline incision. It was well-circumscribed and has no signs of local invasion to the adjacent structures. The gross pathological examination showed an intact mass covered by a smooth and glistening capsule, measuring 16 × 15 × 10 cm and weighing 1.73 kg. On cut-section, the mass showed cystic areas with extensive hemorrhage and yellow areas, suggestive of necrosis. The residual adrenal gland could be identified .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 The gross examination of adrenal hemangioma (a) before and (b) after slicing, on the cut section, shows a cystic area with extensive hemorrhage.</u>\n\n【12】On histological examination, the specimen consisted mainly of infarcted, necrotic tissue with cyst-like vascular spaces that were expanded due to collection of blood and were lined by a single layer of mature endothelial cells, without atypia or mitosis. The stroma showed extensive fibrinous material in which many Liesegangs rings were observed. The rings were assembled in a lamellar fashion similar to psammoma bodies or a parasite egg (commonly, kidney worm). With an amorphous material in the middle, the central core was surrounded by a two-layered wall that stained negative with PAS and von Kossa (for calcium). The annular structure was nonbirefringent when viewed under polarized-light microscopy, and on immunohistochemistry, the cystic lining tested positive for CD34 and CD31 .\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Microscopic examination of the adrenal cavernous hemangioma showing cystic dilated vascular spaces filled with blood and lined with a single layer of mature endothelium, with adjacent compressed adrenal gland (hematoxylin-eosin staining ×40).</u>\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 Microscopic examination showing fibrinous matrix with many basophilic, lamellar structures (the rare: Liesegang ring) (hematoxylin-eosin staining ×100).</u>\n\n【15】The excision surgery was uneventful with no postoperative complications. The patient stayed in the hospital for three days postoperatively without any untoward incident. The six-month follow-up CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no signs of any distant metastasis or recurrence.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Due to the rarity of adrenal hemangioma, this benign form of a vascular tumor requires a definitive preoperative protocol for diagnosis since the tumor is nonfunctional and has no clinical manifestations of its own. The differential diagnoses for AH include benign adrenal, adenomas, myelolipomas, angiomyolipomas, or rare teratomas. Also, malignant adrenal neoplasms such as pheochromocytoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma may be considered while diagnosing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. AHs are mainly unilateral and more than 10 cm in diameter, predominantly affecting females in their fifth to a seventh decade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Biochemical tests, like the 24-hour catecholamine secretion in urine, are essential to rule out any endocrine neoplasms, especially pheochromocytoma. All laboratory test results of the patient reported in this study were unremarkable.\n\n【18】Based on the provisional diagnosis of a malignant adrenal cortical carcinoma, surgical resection of the tumor was done as per the mandatory protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. As reported above, the microscopic examination of the specimen revealed typical blood-filled dilated spaces of vascular origin with a monolayer endothelium. AH is usually a cavernous type (big vessels with wide blood-filled spaces within) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and rarely capillary in type (small well-defined tightly packed capillaries). Also, the presence of the endothelial markers CD34 (a marker of hematopoietic progenitor cells) and CD31 (a marker that stains small and large vessels in the cystic lining) confirms the vascular origin of tumors. These findings also corroborate the proposed congenital nature of AH, i.e. the influence of hereditary factors leading to vascular ectasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Another interesting finding in our study was the evidence of rare microscopic Liesegang rings seen in the AH specimen. Liesegang rings are concentric acellular structures common in chemical reactions where precipitation occurs as a consequence of the accumulation of sub- and supersaturation of insoluble components of a colloidal matrix. Not commonly seen in vivo, these rings are indicative of continuous deposition of organic components in tissues that have undergone degeneration either due to inflammation, fibrosis, necrosis, or cystic degeneration, i.e. the pathogenesis of the Liesegang ring remains unclear. Hitherto, the reported cases of Liesegang rings reveal the commonest site to be in the renal tissue, while other clinical accounts have documented these rings in the paranasal sinuses, eyelid, conjunctivae, and intraperitoneum endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 8\\]</u>. Also, isolated cases of Liesegang rings have been published in association with mammary duct ectasia and breast cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Often varying in shape, the diameter of these rings ranges from 5 to 820 nm depending on the size and location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Morphologically, these structures bear a resemblance to psammoma bodies. Also, they typically test positive for PAS, highlighting the double-layered wall. However, the case presented in the current study tested negative for PAS, similar to another previously published case report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The nonbirefringent nature of these rings under polarized-light microscopy was also seen in our patient’s specimen.\n\n【21】Furthermore, the Liesegang rings seen in our study were accompanied by both necrotic and hemorrhagic changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 12–16\\]</u>. The reason for these changes within the hemangioma and the specific components of the Liesegang ring is yet to be determined. However, the immunohistochemical and histochemical staining for iron (Prussian blue), calcium (von Kossa), amyloid, mucopolysaccharide, keratin, glycogen, and hemangioma’s epithelial antigen is negative. Additionally, using special stains, radiographic imaging, and scanning-electron microscopy, it has been demonstrated that, at times, these rings contain iron, silicon, and sulfur. Also, Tuur et al. have reported the presence of Ca++ ions, organic polycations and polyanions, and other inorganic anions in these rings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Because of this chemical composition, these rings have often been misidentified for parasites’ ova, green growth, calcific deposits, corpora amylacea, psammoma bodies, and the spheroid kind of amyloid. Therefore, even though these rings are a rare finding, it is imperative to characteristically study them to avoid misidentification with parasital ova. The typical presentation of a lamellar structure with a double-layered wall, cross-striations flowing radially, may be used for precise diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13, 15, 17–19\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Besides, the characteristic presence of peripheral discontinuous nodular enhancement with a centripetal pattern on the contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is highly suggestive of AH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u>. Following diagnosis, the standardized treatment for an enlarging symptomatic adrenal tumor or suspected carcinoma is surgical resection, irrespective of its endocrine activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【23】This review aimed to identify and systematically present the typical clinical features of the cavernous adrenal hemangioma to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning. Approximately 73 cases of cavernous AH have been published from 1955 through 2020 which were reviewed in the present study . The average age at which the patients were diagnosed was 55 years (range: 19–84 years old), and the prevalence of female gender in these patients was approximately 1.7 times more than the male gender 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Generally unilateral with no side preference in most cases, only one case of bilateral involvement has been reported so far 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The usual size has been reported to be above 10 cm in diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> ranging up to 35 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Endocrinology examinations of the adrenal tumor were normal for 67 out of 73 cases. Of the six clinically functional adrenal hemangiomas identified, three cases were of hyperaldosteronism, while the other three had subclinical Cushing’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The mean diameter of all these reported cases of adrenal hemangiomas with documented specific tumor characteristics was 11 cm and weighed an average of 752 gm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Table 1 Summary of the adrenal cavernous hemangiomas reported between 1955 and 2020.\n\n【25】Of the 73 cases reviewed, 42 (57.5%) were discovered incidentally with no clinical symptoms, while the other 31 (42.5%) had clinical manifestations, including abdominal symptoms of epigastric pain and heaviness (n = 10) and pain or discomfort in the flank (n = 8), and 3 patients presented with rupture of the adrenal mass leading to retroperitoneal hemorrhage and hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25–27\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Surgical mass excision was done in 69 cases, of which 16 patients (22.5%) had laparoscopic surgery. Of the two nonoperated patients, one patient died from an unrelated cause, while the other opted for monitoring and observation since the tumor size was small and no clinical manifestations were seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 24\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Lastly, mitotane, an established adrenolytic drug, was used in these patients that did not affect the viability of primary culture cells. However, cytotoxic drugs like doxorubicin decreased the viability of these cells. Furthermore, there is evidence that sunitinib, a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor, drastically reduced the viability of the primary culture cells, indicating that the drug and its analogs may be useful in medically treating adrenal hemangiomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【28】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】Adrenal hemangioma should be considered as an important differential diagnosis of adrenal neoplasms despite being a rare finding.

We followed up the relief of symptoms and long-term, over-a-year microbiota stabilization in a 46-year-old man, who underwent FMT for antibiotic-induced, non-CDI colitis nine months after being treated for CDI by FMT. Fecal and mucosal microbiota was analyzed before the second FMT and during 14 months after FMT by using a high-throughput phylogenetic microarray. FMT resolved the symptoms and restored normal GI-function. Microbiota analysis revealed increased bacterial diversity in the rectal mucosa and a stable fecal microbiota up to three months after FMT. A number of mucosa-associated bacteria increased after FMT and some of these bacteria remained increased in feces up to 14 months. Notably, the increased bacteria included Bifidobacterium spp. and various representatives of Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, such as Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, and C. colinum, which are presumed to be anti-inflammatory. The presented case suggests a possible role of microbiota in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality and improves our knowledge on the etiology of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The intestinal tract harbors an extremely diverse microbiota, which is crucial in maintaining immunological and physiological homeostasis of the mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Dysbiosis of microbiota (aberrant composition) can lead to loss of normal, regulatory immune effects in the gut mucosa, and dysbiotic microbiota has been associated with a number of inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. A recent hypothesis presents that, after epithelial insult by a pathogen or an injury, specific symbiotic bacteria are needed to restore mucosal homeostasis back to a basal level by ceasing the acute inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In support of the hypothesis, a community of 17 intestinal strains attenuated intestinal inflammation by stimulating regulatory T cells in a mouse colitis model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>, and it is increasingly considered also for the treatment of noninfectious colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This report describes treatment of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis by FMT nine months after the first FMT treatment for CDI and the stabilization of intestinal microbiota in a 46-year-old man during 14 months after the second FMT.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】##### 2.1. The Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient was a 46-year-old man with history of hypertension and ventricular extrasystolia, which were being controlled by medication. He had no known allergies, and he had travelled only in Western Europe. He smoked. He had had several sinusitis episodes. Two years before the onset of refractory Clostridium difficile infection, he had septic infection due to the axillar bursitis. His uncle has Crohn’s disease.\n\n【7】The patient had Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), after amoxicillin clavulanate treatment for otitis media. CDI was verified by cultivation of C. difficile and positive toxin test of feces (VIDAS C. difficile Toxin A & B CDAB, BioMerieux, France). No resolution of symptoms was achieved with oral metronidazole (400 mg thrice a day) or vancomycin (first 120 mg four times a day and later 250 mg four times a day). Because of refractory situation, patient was hospitalized and the treatment was switched to meropenem (1 g thrice a day intravenously) and rifaximin (400 mg twice a day). In addition, he got one dose of immunoglobulin 27.5 g intravenously. After six days of treatment, the patient was discharged with ten days of rifaximin (400 mg twice a day) treatment. Three days after stopping the rifaximin treatment, the symptoms reappeared including 10 diarrhea episodes per day. The patient restarted rifaximin treatment and continued it until colonoscopy and FMT were done three weeks later. Mild nonspecific proctitis was found in colonoscopy. The histology showed postinfectious inflammation and no typical signs of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. FMT was performed by infusing fecal suspension into the caecum. The diarrhea disappeared within two days after FMT.\n\n【8】Seven months after FMT, the patient got clarithromycin for sinusitis and diarrhea reappeared. Symptoms were not as severe as earlier; that is, he had 5-6 diarrhea episodes per day and urgency of defecation. No C. difficile or toxins were found in feces by cultivation or toxin tests, respectively. The symptoms did not resolve spontaneously during 8 weeks after the cessation of clarithromycin. Colonoscopy was reassessed to exclude chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The macroscopic and microscopic findings were similar as seen previously, that is, mild inflammation. Fecal calprotectin was also tested and was 12 μg/g. The patient received the second FMT and thereafter he has had no GI-symptoms (two and a half years by the time of submitting this report). The patient had three antibiotic courses during the follow-up period between 10 and 12 months after the second FMT.\n\n【9】##### 2.2. The Donor and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT)\n\n【10】The donor of fecal material in both transplantations was the patient’s 35-year-old wife, who was pregnant at the time of the second FMT. She had not received antimicrobial therapy for the past 6 months and did not have any intestinal symptoms. She was tested by the protocol for fecal donors as described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Thirty grams of the donor’s feces were suspended into 150 mL of tap water and the suspension was infused into the caecum through colonoscopy as described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【11】##### 2.3. Samples and Microbiota Analysis\n\n【12】Rectal biopsies were taken from the patient at the time of the second FMT and one month later in proctoscopy and stored in −80°C until further processing. The patient and donor collected fecal samples after the second FMT according to the sampling scheme presented in Figure 1. The fecal samples were placed in a home freezer at −20°C immediately after defecation and stored in the home freezer for maximally 4 months until transfer to laboratory for further analysis. Six healthy adult volunteers (3 males and 3 females, mean age 67 years), who underwent diagnostic colonoscopy and were found to have a healthy intestine, were included as a comparison group for mucosa-associated microbiota. DNA extraction was done as described previously by using mechanical disruption of bacterial cells by bead-beating followed by DNA purification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Microbiota analysis was done by using the HITChip high-throughput bacterial phylogenetic microarray as described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–11\\]</u>.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Microbiota composition at the phylum level and bacterial genus level enterotype (ET) status before FMT and during the 14-month follow-up period.</u>\n\n【14】##### 2.4. Ethical Considerations\n\n【15】The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS), Finland (Dnro HUS 124/13/03/01/11). The patient was informed about the experimental nature and possible risks of FMT. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and donor for publication of this case report. The healthy volunteers who donated biopsies signed informed consent.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【17】##### 3.1. Resolution of GI-Symptoms by FMT\n\n【18】The patient’s recurrent Clostridium difficile infection was successfully treated by FMT. Seven months later, he got antibiotic-induced diarrhea, which was not as severe as earlier. Also, no C. difficile or toxins were found in feces. The symptoms did not resolve spontaneously within eight weeks after stopping the antibiotic. Colonoscopy excluded inflammatory bowel disease, but mild inflammation was observed. The patient received FMT again and the GI-symptoms were resolved within few days. The patient had three antibiotic courses during the follow-up period between 10 and 12 months after the second FMT, but these antibiotic treatments did not induce diarrhea.\n\n【19】##### 3.2. Fecal Microbiota of the Donor\n\n【20】In general, fecal microbiota of the donor was found to be stable during the 14-month follow-up period, but a decrease in stability was observed between 2-day and 2-week and 4- and 7-month samples, that is, approximately one month before and three months after the delivery, respectively . The most predominating phylum was Firmicutes, where Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa and uncultured Clostridiales were the largest groups . Phylum Bacteroidetes constituted 2–13% and Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria less than 4% of the total microbiota in the donor . In the enterotype (ET) profiling, the donor’s fecal microbiota represented ET3, that is, the Ruminococcus enterotype . The diversity and richness of fecal microbiota were higher in the donor than in the patient throughout the follow-up period .\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Stability of the fecal microbiota determined as Pearson correlation of the microbiota profiles between the subsequent sampling points.</u>\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Diversity and richness of microbiota in the fecal samples (a and c) and in mucosal biopsies from the patient and six healthy controls (b and d). 0 d: pre-FMT sample; 2 wk to 14 mo: post-FMT samples.

Mucosal and Fecal Microbiota of the Patient during 14 Months after the FMT\n\n【24】Intestinal microbiota composition was followed up with frequent sampling during 14 months after the FMT. In the patient, a shift from a Bacteroidetes-rich fecal microbiota to a microbiota, where Firmicutes constitute over 87% of the bacterial community, was observed from two weeks after FMT onwards . Particularly, the relative proportion of Clostridium cluster XIVa increased by 20% in feces after FMT. However, in mucosa, the relative abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes increased and Firmicutes decreased after FMT. Fecal microbiota two days after FMT resembled the pre-FMT microbiota and may reflect an adaptation stage. Also, fecal microbiota enterotype (ET) profiling analysis showed a shift at 2 days after FMT. Fecal microbiota represented enterotype 3 (ET3), that is, the Ruminococcus enterotype at all other sampling points except at 2 days after FMT. In contrast, mucosal microbiota represented enterotype 2 (ET2), that is, the Prevotella enterotype . Consistently, both the phylum level and enterotype profiling, that is, genus level analysis, showed that the composition of mucosa-associated microbiota is different from that of the fecal microbiota. The patient’s fecal microbiota was stable from 2 weeks to 3 months after FMT, but then stability decreased slightly between 3 and 7 months and more notably between 7 and 14 months . From 7- to 14-month fecal samples, a shift back to a Bacteroidetes-rich fecal microbiota was seen . The shift cooccurred with the administration of three antibiotic courses between these sampling points.\n\n【25】Further, the analysis of mucosa-associated microbiota revealed a marked increase in the diversity and richness of bacterial species in post-FMT rectal biopsy as compared to the pre-FMT biopsy . The increase in diversity and richness in the patient’s rectal mucosa exceeded the interindividual variability of rectal biopsies from six healthy controls . The increase in diversity also exceeded intraindividual variability between ileal and rectal biopsies from the same individual . The results indicate that the increase in diversity and richness of the patient’s mucosal microbiota is beyond the natural variability. Thus, the mucosal microbiota of the patient seemed to be strongly affected by FMT. However, in the luminal contents (feces), the increase in bacterial diversity and richness was modest . Interestingly, the post-FMT biopsy of the patient clustered with fecal samples of the donor in hierarchical clustering of the microbiota profiles 通用删除1(英):<u>(Supplementary Figure  1 available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/913867)</u>. A number of bacterial groups in the mucosa showed either a decrease or an increase in their relative abundance after FMT . Most of these bacterial groups (46 out of 49) showed a similar difference between the donor and the pre-FMT patient fecal samples. Further, specific bacterial groups in post-FMT mucosal sample showed the same direction of change in their relative abundance in the fecal sample at 14 months after FMT and during the follow-up period from 2 weeks to 7 months (in average) as compared to the pre-FMT feces . The increased bacterial groups include Bifidobacterium spp. (Actinobacteria), Clostridium leptum et rel. Oscillospira guillermondii et rel. Sporobacter termitidis et rel. Anaerotruncus colihominis et rel. Ruminococcus callidus et rel. R. bromii et rel. (Clostridium cluster IV), Dialister spp. (Clostridium cluster IX), Lachnospira pectinoschiza et rel. C. colinum et rel. (Clostridium cluster XIVa), uncultured Clostridiales I, and Oxalobacter formigenes et rel. (Proteobacteria) . We assume that these bacterial groups have established themselves stably from the donor’s microbiota or have successfully and stably recovered from the patient’s own microbiota after FMT. On the other hand, four groups belonging to Bacteroidetes and Clostridium ramosum et rel. (Clostridium cluster XVIII) decreased after FMT both in mucosa and in feces.\n\n【26】Table 1 Mucosal bacteria with >2-fold change in relative abundance after FMT and constituting >0.01% of the microbiota.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【28】The case described herein presents an expansion of the use of FMT to treat antibiotic-induced, non-CDI colitis. FMT restored normal GI-function and the patient has not had GI-symptoms thereafter, that is, two and a half years at the time of writing this report.\n\n【29】Interestingly, the patient did not seem to have perturbed fecal microbiota prior to FMT. The relative proportion of Bacteroidetes was rather high, but within the normal variation in healthy Europeans adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Also, the microbiota composition of the donor was typical to healthy adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and showed high stability during the last month of pregnancy and three months postpartum, which is in line with the results from a recent study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In the patient, the proportion of Bacteroidetes still increased two days after the FMT, but later a clear shift to a Firmicutes-dominating microbiota was observed. It seems that a period ranging from few days to two weeks is needed before the establishment of post-FMT microbiota. The temporary shift of the microbiota enterotype at 2d after FMT also indicates a transition period. At the phylum level, fecal microbiota was relatively stable from two weeks up to three months after FMT. Recently, a stable phylum level microbiota composition was reported in three patients, who were followed up for 3-4 months after FMT for recurrent C. difficile infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In our patient, the diversity of microbiota decreased and the total microbiota was less stable after three months after FMT. The result indicates that microbiota evolution may continue for a considerable period of time after FMT and underlines the need for long-term post-FMT follow-up studies of microbiota stabilization.\n\n【30】In the patient, fecal and mucosal microbiota showed different compositions at both bacterial phylum and genus levels. In the enterotype profiling, fecal microbiota was found to be enterotype 3 (ET3) and mucosal microbiota enterotype 2 (ET2). The three enterotypes are each characterized by a discriminating genus, Bacteroides (ET1), Prevotella (ET2), or Ruminococcus (ET3), whose abundance correlates with the abundance of other genera 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Thus, the enterotypes are driven by groups of bacteria that together contribute to the preferred microbiota composition, which is a result of adaption to the particular environment. Interestingly, the bacterial diversity and richness were higher in the mucosal biopsies as compared to feces. Similarly, higher bacterial richness was observed in the mucosa as compared to matched fecal samples in a recent study comprising four individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Clearly, intestinal lumen and mucosa represent different environments and, consequently, harbor different microbiota.\n\n【31】We observed a shift back to a Bacteroidetes-rich fecal microbiota in the patient at 14 months after FMT. The shift was associated with the administration of three antibiotic courses, which, however, did not induce diarrhea this time. Thus, at the phylum level composition, the patient’s microbiota at 14 months resembled microbiota before FMT, but apparently he maintained some key bacterial species that could support gut functionality even when challenged by antibiotics. Indeed, we observed a drastic increase in the diversity and richness of mucosal microbiota after FMT indicating either the strong engraftment of donor’s microbiota or the recovery of patient’s own microbiota particularly in the mucosal lining. Specific mucosa-associated bacteria, which increased in abundance, showed an increase also in feces up to 14 months after FMT. The increased bacterial groups include Bifidobacterium and Dialister spp. bacteria related to Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, C. colinum, and Oxalobacter formigenes, as well as uncultured Clostridiales I. We assume that these bacterial groups have established themselves stably after FMT and may have a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis. Previously, Bifidobacterium, C. leptum, Sporobacter, Oscillospira, Anaerotruncus, R. bromii, Dialister, and uncultured Clostridiales have been found to be increased in healthy individuals as compared to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 15\\]</u>. Further, a combination of 17 strains of intestinal bacteria, belonging to the genera Ruminococcus, Anaerotruncus, Lachnospiraceae, Clostridium, Eubacterium, and Blautia, has been shown to attenuate inflammation in a mouse colitis model by stimulating regulatory T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As an exception, O. formigenes has no reported anti-inflammatory effects but is associated with a reduced risk of calcium oxalate stone disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Collectively, our patient showed constantly increased levels of intestinal bacteria, which seem to have anti-inflammatory effects and possibly ceased the mild, on-going inflammation.\n\n【32】In the presented case, FMT resolved the symptoms in an antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis. The post-FMT bacterial community restored normal GI-function possibly by ceasing the mild, on-going inflammation. The microbiota analysis suggests that specific members of microbiota may have a role in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality. Interestingly, the 17 strains in the study by Atarashi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> exerted an anti-inflammatory effect as a community, but not as individual strains. Thus, it seems that an assembly of bacterial species, rather than a specific single species, is essential in preventing or treating intestinal diseases. Today, FMT is the most straightforward way of introducing the necessary combination of bacteria to a patient, but there is an increasing need to identify the crucial bacterial species that are able to control infection or inflammation in the intestine. The first two cases on the use of an “artificial stool” consisting of pure cultures of intestinal bacterial have shown promising results in the treatment of recurrent CDI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Clinical FMT-studies linked with microbiota analysis can greatly advance these efforts and improve our understanding of the etiology of diseases, where dysbiosis of the microbiota is considered to play a role.\n\n【33】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【34】The antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis of a 46-year-old man was successfully treated with FMT. The results suggest a possible role of intestinal microbiota and its specific members in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Bone metastasis to Th1 of unknown origin was confirmed by CT scan, MRI, and bone scintigraphy. As his prostate specific antigen level was very high (387 ng/ml), he was referred to the urologic department. Digital rectal examination showed locally advanced prostate cancer. Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy and bilateral orchiectomy were performed on the same day in February, 2010. A smooth stone of 11 mm in diameter was incidentally found moving freely in the right hydrocele space . Bilateral testes (right 24 g, left 24 g) and epididymis were anatomically unremarkable, not indicating previous infection or trauma, but a little amount of serous liquid was drained from the space between the tunicae lining the scrotum and the testicles tunica vaginalis.

Janus kinase inhibitors, namely, tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib, are the latest drug class for the treatment of RA with a good safety profile. We present the case of a patient with RA-ILD successfully treated with tofacitinib. A 52-year-old man was referred to our multidisciplinary clinic for rheumatic and pulmonary diseases for an active erosive seropositive RA and progressive ILD. Previous treatments were GC, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, etanercept, withdrawn after ILD detection, and tocilizumab, discontinued due to relapsing infections. After our evaluation, we proposed rituximab in addition to low-dose GC and hydroxychloroquine, ineffective on joint involvement. Therefore, we proposed tofacitinib which allowed us to control joint involvement, stabilize ILD improving respiratory symptoms, and manage the frequent infectious episodes that occurred initially. The short half-life and rapid-acting of tofacitinib are two helpful characteristics regarding this aspect. Despite limited data from randomized trials and real-life, tofacitinib could represent a safe therapeutic option for RA-ILD patients. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm this encouraging report.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease affecting 0.5–1% of the population worldwide. It is characterized by chronic symmetrical erosive synovitis and sometimes by extra-articular manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, including interstitial lung disease (ILD), which represents the most common lung involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. ILD significantly affects therapeutic approach, quality of life, morbidity, and mortality of RA patients, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 4 to 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Among the main risk factors for the development of AR-ILD, we consider high titles of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), male sex, and cigarette smoking history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Sometimes lung interstitial involvement is early and represents the only sign of disease. In these cases, a clinical and serological follow-up may lead to evidence of autoimmune disease later in time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】In AR patients with lung involvement, the radiological UIP pattern is not only the most frequent one (about 60–70%) but also the most associated with poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The treatment of patients with RA and concomitant ILD is nowadays challenging and mainly based on glucocorticoids (GC) and immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Therapeutic options in these patients are complicated by the possible pulmonary toxicity of many disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and by their unclear efficacy on pulmonary involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The scientific community is constantly looking for therapeutic alternatives to control RA activity avoiding lung toxicity and, possibly, influencing the natural history of RA-ILD. Furthermore, RA-ILD treatment should be safe and easy to manage in case of infectious adverse events, giving the higher infectious risk in ILD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK-i), namely, tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib, are the latest drug class of DMARDs commercialized for the treatment of RA with a good safety profile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–13\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Here, we present the case of a patient affected with progressive RA-ILD successfully treated with tofacitinib.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【10】A 52-year-old man, former smoker (45 pack years), was referred to our multidisciplinary outpatient clinic for rheumatic and rare lung diseases for an active RA associated with progressive ILD. His past clinical history revealed systemic arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and class II obesity (BMI: 37).\n\n【11】Diagnosis of RA was performed in April 2012. RF and ACPA were positive (42 and 300 U/mL, respectively), while antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigens (ENA), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were negative.\n\n【12】Arthritis was aggressive and rapidly erosive at hands and wrists. The patient had been initially treated with methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg weekly, effective but replaced with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg daily for the desire of paternity in December 2012. Since HCQ became ineffective, etanercept (ETA) 50 mg weekly was added in April 2014.\n\n【13】Fourteen months later, ILD was casually detected , and ETA was replaced with subcutaneous tocilizumab (TCZ) 162 mg weekly. This latter drug was stopped after few months for relapsing infections, mainly involving the urinary and lower respiratory tract .\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Clinical course and therapeutic strategy.

At that time, he presented severe restrictive ventilatory impairment, with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 52% of the predicted value and a severe reduction in gas exchange with a diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 33% of the predicted value. Moreover, he desaturated at 6-minute walking test (nadir reached after two minutes with an oxygen saturation of 87%). As far as RA activity, he showed arthritis of wrists and II-III right metacarpophalangeal; C-reactive protein (CPR; 50 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 50 mm/h) were both increased, with a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS-28 CRP) of 5.27.\n\n【16】At chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia was described, characterized by reticular abnormalities and honeycombing aspects, particularly at the right lower lobe .\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Chest high-resolution computed tomography: November 2017 compared to last follow-up, September 2020.

Two months later, arthritis was still active, involving bilateral MCF and proximal interphalangeal joints of hands, wrists, and ankles associated with ESR and CRP elevation (45 mm and 60 mg/L, respectively).\n\n【20】After multidisciplinary discussion with a pulmonologist, in March 2018, we prescribed tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. Vaccination for varicella zoster virus (VZV) was not performed because of the immunosuppressive condition of the patient.\n\n【21】One month later, the patient presented an infection of the upper respiratory tract, successfully treated with antibiotic therapy; tofacitinib was discontinued for ten days. Despite other few respiratory and urinary infectious episodes, RA remission was obtained after 3 months. Disease flares appeared when tofacitinib was discontinued, but every time, a rapid arthritis control was obtained with the reintroduction of tofacitinib.\n\n【22】From August 2018 to March 2020, we observed a stable RA remission, and no other infections were reported by the patient.\n\n【23】Despite an initial radiological progression detected at HRCT in November 2018, respiratory symptoms improved and lung function (FVC and DLCO) remained stable over the time .\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】ILD is a serious pulmonary complication of RA characterized by a significant impact on morbidity and mortality, representing a current therapeutic challenge because of the possible pulmonary toxicity of many traditional and biological DMARDs, their unclear efficacy on pulmonary disease, and the higher infectious risk in comparison to non-ILD RA patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【26】JAK-is have recently emerged in clinical practice for the treatment of RA, and they are recommended by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) in patients failing an initial treatment with MTX or other conventional DMARDs with poor prognostic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Despite limited data, no relevant safety concerns in relation to both ILD onset and progression are emerged for tofacitinib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11, 15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【28】A post hoc analysis on 7061 RA patients receiving tofacitinib from clinical trials and long-term extension studies reported an incidence rate for ILD with both tofacitinib doses of 0.18 per 100 patient-years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Few real-life data are up to now available. Among 15 RA-ILD patients treated with tofacitinib, none showed worsening of dyspnoea, while improvement was reported in some cases; moreover, respiratory function and DLCO remained stable in the majority of subjects evaluated, while 4 patients improved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【30】In another study, 3 RA-ILD patients were successfully treated with tofacitinib without pulmonary adverse events in an 8–12-month period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【31】About the possible effect on ILD, some case reports have recently been published in which tofacitinib appears to be effective on ILD related to antimelanoma differentiation-associated 5 gene antibody-positive dermatomyositis and antisynthetase syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–23\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Tofacitinib has been demonstrated to be able to reduce the progression of zymosan-induced ILD in SKG mice, a murine model of RA. Tofacitinib significantly suppressed the progression of ILD compared to control by expanding myeloid-derived suppressor cells and suppressing Th17 cells’ proliferation and differentiation, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect of tofacitinib for RA-ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【33】However, other in vitro studies reported that the inhibition of JAK2, but not the selective JAK1/JAK3 pathway, significantly reduced IL-17A-induced fibrogenic response in fibroblast from IPF and RA-ILD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Rituximab was proposed as a therapeutic option for RA-ILD, even if it has been associated with an increased risk of infections in patients with RA-ILD.\n\n【35】Unfortunately, in our patient, rituximab was ineffective on arthritis and ILD, and it could have contributed to the infectious adverse events showed by the patient in the next six months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【36】The short half-life and rapid-acting of tofacitinib are two characteristics that we have considered for the treatment of our patient. Moreover, we took advantage by an intermittent therapy when the infectious events appeared obtaining a rapid clearance of the drug. On the other side, the patient also showed a rapid flare of disease after tofacitinib discontinuation, requiring a temporary increase of prednisone dose.\n\n【37】#### 4\\.

We report identical twins with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection complicated by pulmonary emboli in association with anti-phospholipid antibodies.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Patient 1\n\n【6】A 13-year-old Caucasian female presented with cough and fever of 1-week duration. Chest X-ray revealed left lower lobe segmental pneumonia. The patient was admitted to the hospital after she failed to improve. Intravenous ceftriaxone was added to azithromycin. Blood culture was negative, and sputum culture grew normal flora. Initial laboratory tests showed the following: hemoglobin of 12.2 (12–15 g/dl), white blood cell count of 4.5 (4.3–13.5 thous/μl), and platelet count of 236 (150–500 thous/μl). Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR was positive followed by elevated specific Ig M being 4.10 (<0.9) and IgG being 0.88 (<0.9). On day 3 of hospital admission, she developed increasing respiratory distress. Antibiotics coverage was broadened. Chest CT with contrast showed multifocal pneumonia with bilateral parapneumonic effusions. The patient ultimately required BiPAP for respiratory support and was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).\n\n【7】On day 2 of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, she complained of left calf pain with mild swelling. US doppler revealed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in left gastrocnemius, posterior tibial (left), and popliteal and peroneal veins, and chest CT was reread as showing filling defects involving segmental branches to the right middle lobe pulmonary artery and right lower lobe segmental pulmonary arteries. She was started on enoxaparin at a dose of subcutaneous 60 mg (1 mg/kg/dose) twice daily. Echocardiogram was significant for elevated right ventricle (RV) systolic pressure. Anti-phospholipid antibody studies demonstrated an elevated anticardiolipin IgG of 86 (0–14.9 GPL), IgM of 120.7 (0–12.4 MPL), normal IgA of <9.5 (0–11.9 APL), and anti-beta-2-glycoprotein IgG/IgM of <9.5/21.9 (<9.5/21.9 GGU/SMU). DRVVT was elevated to 54 with a normalized ratio of 1.3. On PICU day 4, antifactor Xa level was subtherapeutic and enoxaparin dose was adjusted to 70 mg after which the therapeutic level of antifactor Xa of 0.7 U/ml (0.6–1 U/ml) was achieved. On PICU day 5, based on her clinical improvement, antibiotics were weaned. She continued to improve and was discharged after 9 days.\n\n【8】At follow-up, her enoxaparin was switched to single daily dose (120 mg) to achieve a therapeutic level of 1.3 U/ml (1-2 U/ml) for a duration of 3 months. Symptoms completely resolved, and she returned to normal and full activities.\n\n【9】##### 2.2. Patient 2\n\n【10】The 13-year-old Caucasian identical twin of the patient cited above presented to the emergency department with cough of 9-day duration and left leg pain of 2-day duration. She was seen a week prior by her primary care doctor who started azithromycin. Two days later, she was noted to be hypoxic (89% on room air), tachycardiac (131 bpm), and febrile (38.4°C) in the emergency department. Lung exam showed diminished breath sound on the left, and left calf tenderness was noted. Initial laboratory tests showed the following: hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dl (12–15 g/dl), white blood cell count of 9.6 thous/μl (4.3–13.5 thous/μl), platelet count of 259 thous/μl (150–500 thous/μl), lactate of 1.2 mmol/l (0.5–2.2 mmol/l), and BNP of <10 pg/ml (0–100 pg/ml). Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR was negative followed by elevated specific IgM and IgG levels of 4.39 (<0.9) and 2.74 (<0.9), respectively. Echocardiography was unremarkable. Anti-nuclear antibodies were normal. Anti-phospholipid antibody studies demonstrated anticardiolipin IgG of 13.7 (0–14.9 GPL), IgM of 28.8 (0–12.4 MPL), normal IgA of <9.5 (0–11.9 APL), and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein IgG/IgM <9.5/<9.5 (<9.5/21.9 GGU/SMU). DRVVT was elevated to 54 sec (0–41 sec) with a normalized ratio of 1.3. A chest X-ray revealed right perihilar interstitial infiltrates. Antibiotic coverage was broadened. Doppler ultrasound for deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity showed normal venous flow dynamics. CT angiography demonstrated multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli in segmental distribution of bilateral upper lobes, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe, along with dense consolidation of the right lower lobe. She was admitted to the PICU where she was started on an intravenous heparin drip.\n\n【11】On day 2 of hospital admission, she was switched to enoxaparin 60 mg twice daily (1 mg/kg/dose). Initial antifactor Xa level was subtherapeutic. Dose was adjusted to 80 mg twice daily, and a therapeutic level of antifactor Xa of 0.7 U/ml (0.6–1 U/ml) was achieved. She demonstrated gradual improvement and was discharged home on day 6.\n\n【12】At follow-up, she was switched to single daily dose of enoxaparin (120 mg) with a therapeutic antifactor Xa level of 1.5 U/ml (1-2 U/ml) for a duration of 3 months. She had complete resolution of symptoms and returned to normal and full activities.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】There are acquired and inherited factors leading to a hypercoagulable state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Acquired factors that promote coagulation pathways include surgery, pregnancy, hormonal replacement therapy, estrogen containing oral contraceptive, malignancy, inflammation, infection, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Genetic factors such as factor V Leiden and prothrombin G2021 A mutation are identified in a variable percentage of patients depending on demographics.\n\n【15】Mycoplasma pneumoniae\\-associated hypercoagulable state has been described to be secondary to endothelial damage leading to release of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of procoagulant pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Pulmonary emboli are the third leading cause of mortality associated with mycoplasma infection if not diagnosed and treated promptly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Anti-phospholipid antibodies are found to be elevated in 1–5% of the healthy population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. They can also be elevated in bacterial infection, viral infections, and autoimmune diseases (i.e. lupus) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Elevated anti-phospholipid antibodies have also been reported after immunization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. The mechanism by which thrombosis is precipitated in patients with anti-phospholipid antibodies remains unclear.\n\n【17】Most patients with infectious causes of elevated aPL antibody return to normal levels within 2 or 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Thromboembolic events in association with elevated aPL in the setting of infection are difficult to differentiate from other causes. For both patients, prothrombotic and genetic laboratory evaluations were initiated after enoxaparin was discontinued to identify potential genetic prothrombotic variables in these identical twins. Laboratory studies revealed resolution of elevated anti-phospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin IgA, IgG, IgM, beta-2-glycoprotein 1 IgG and IgM, and DRVVT). The genetic evaluation was normal for factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, fibrinogen, thrombin time, factor VIII, protein C activity, protein S activity, plasminogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, homocysteine level, ANA screen, dsDNA, and lipoprotein A. Although heterozygosity for MTHFR C677 T was found in both patients, it was not thought clinically relevant in the context of normal homocysteine level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】Our report documents the unique occurrence of transient para-infectious anti-phospholipid antibodies provoked by Mycoplasma infection leading to venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in identical female twins.

GCTs-present most frequently in the head and neck region, with over 50% of lesions occurring in this region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>; the commonest site of presentation in this region is the tongue.\n\n【5】GCTs in the oral cavity usually present clinically as pink or yellow sessile lesions which are small, solitary, painless, and covered by intact mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. GCT are usually benign in nature; however they can present in a malignant form in fewer than 2% of cases. In benign cases treatment is surgical and usually curative with extremely low recurrence rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【6】This paper describes unusual presentation of two cases of oral GCT.\n\n【7】Case 1. A 63-year-old white Caucasian female with a three-month history of a painful, rapidly growing swelling on her tongue was referred to Department of Oral Maxillofacial Surgery in Kent, UK. She had a 40-year smoking history and was taking nicorandil. There was no evidence of extraoral pathology; intraorally the lesion presented as a firm, pedunculated, polypoid lesion with a flat surface on the dorsal surface of the tongue to the left of the midline, measuring 5 mm in diameter. The lump was tender to palpation and had an unusual hyperkeratotic surface .  \nAn excisional biopsy was performed under local anaesthesia and the specimen submitted for histological analysis . The histopathology report revealed a polypoid area in the centre of the biopsy composed of closely packed rounded cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. The surface epithelium showed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. On immunostaining the epithelial cells were positive for CK5/6 and the stromal cells positive for S-100. The final diagnosis was a benign granular cell tumour. The patient now attends six monthly reviews and has had no recurrence.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Intraoral photo of the granular cell tumour affecting the dorsum of the tongue. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Low power view of oral granular cell tumour stained with hematoxylin and eosin. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | High power view of oral granular cell tumour stained with hematoxylin and eosin. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】Case 2. A 45-year-old Caucasian female was referred to the department regarding an asymptomatic, raised white patch in her left buccal mucosa. Medically the patient was fit and well, however was a smoker. Extraorally no pathology was detected intraorally the lesion presented as a thick, raised, white plaque, fixed to underlying tissues and measuring 6 mm in diameter .  \nAn incisional biopsy was performed under local anaesthetic and the specimen sent for histological analysis. This showed markedly hyperkeratotic, acanthotic squamous epithelium with intraepithelial cells containing granular cytoplasm.  \nImmunocytochemistry showed a strong positive reaction for S-100. The initial report was suggestive of a granular cell tumour; however the biopsy was superficial, and a repeat excisional biopsy was performed. The results of this confirmed the diagnosis of a granular cell tumour; the immunohistochemistry showed that the cells were positive for S-100, but negative for Melan A, MNF-116, and CD68, consistent with a granular cell tumour .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Intraoral photo of the granular cell tumour affecting the buccal mucosa. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | Immunoreactivity of the lesion for S-100 protein. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【14】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Granular cell tumor is an uncommon soft tissue neoplasm. Generally it is seen as a solitary asymptomatic nodule less than 3 cms in size involving the subcutaneous or submucosal tissues. The nodular mass is hard in consistency and generally reveals an intact overlying epithelium. This paper presents two cases of atypical presentation of such tumors. The first case showed an intraoral lesion that presented as a firm, pedunculated, polypoid lesion with a flat surface on the dorsal surface of the tongue. It was tender and had an unusual hyperkeratotic surface. Excisional biopsy was performed, and it confirmed the diagnosis. The second case showed an intraoral lesion that was thick, raised with a white plaque, and fixed to the underlying tissue. Incisional biopsy was performed and confirmed the diagnosis.\n\n【16】Clinical diagnosis of GCT is difficult due to the similarity in presentation with many other epithelial lesions; differential diagnosis may include fibromas, lipomas, neurofibromas, dermoid cyst, pleomorphic adenoma of minor salivary glands, and neuromas. In order to obtain a definitive diagnosis of these lesions, histological examination is necessary including monoclonal antibody S-100 staining.\n\n【17】The optimal treatment is by local conservative surgical excision with a margin of soft tissue; when this is performed satisfactorily, recurrence rates are low. This treatment has been carried out in both of the previous cases, and recurrence has not occurred.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The congenital form, according to the main theory, originates from embryonic cells of the 1st and 2nd branchial arch. The acquired form may be due to traumatic or iatrogenic causes and as a result of the occlusion of a sebaceous gland duct. Its occurrence is less and is estimated to be from 1.6 to 6.4% of the dermoid cysts of the body in adults and 0.29% of the head and neck tumors occurring in children. They may also be classified as anatomical and histological. Anatomically, they are divided into median genioglossal, median geniohyoid, and lateral cysts, while histologically they are divided into epidermoid, dermoid cysts and teratomas. Clinically, a distinction between supra and inferior type as well as between central and lateral type is proposed in relation to themylohyoidmuscle and themidline, respectively. Histologically, an estimation of dermoid, epidermoid, and teratoid cysts is reported. Enucleation via intraoral and/or extraoral approach is the method of treatment. Two case reports of dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth are presented in this paper, and an evaluation with regard to pathology, clinical findings, differential diagnosis, and treatment is discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The term “dermoid cyst” in the floor of the mouth is used to describe three types of histologically related cysts: dermoid, epidermoid, and teratomata/teratoid cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth have been the subject of a good many researches. Jourdain 通用删除7(英):<u>(1778)</u> called them sublingual dermoid cysts. Roser 通用删除7(英):<u>(1859)</u> maintained that many cases of ranula and sebaceous cysts on the base of the tongue were dermoid cysts. Bytlin 通用删除7(英):<u>(1885)</u> was preoccupied with their description but also not only with their differentiation from other similar lesions of this area, while Chairi 通用删除7(英):<u>(1891)</u> proposed that the tumors in the floor of the mouth originated from the entrapment of epidermoid cells at the embryonic age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Dermoid cysts occur primarily in sites where embryonic parts fuse together. The majority of reported cases are in the midline of the body and especially in testis and ovaries. In the head and neck region, they occur most frequently in the periorbital area, while 6.5% of dermoid cysts in this region present in the oral cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The incidence of floor of the mouth cysts is quite less 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In a study carried out by Mayo Clinic 通用删除7(英):<u>(1937)</u>, in a total of 1495 dermoid cysts of the body, 103 (6.9%) concerned the head and neck and only 24 (1.6%) the floor of the mouth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>, even though these findings have been challenged on account of the high (44%) rate of hair follicle cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. In another study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, of a total of 541 evident dermoid cysts of the body, 184 (34%) occurred in the head and neck and 35 (6.5%) of these in the floor of the mouth. Lastly, in yet another study, out of 1007 tumors of the head and neck area in children, 95 (9.4%) were dermoid cysts and only 3 (0.3%) occurred in the floor of the mouth.\n\n【5】The present paper deals with two cases of dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth and at the same time discusses the pathology, clinical picture, and treatment as well as the differentiation of these cysts within a broad spectrum of oncomorphous lesions in this area.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Case Report 1\n\n【8】A 21-year-old female patient came to the consultation unit of the maxillafacial surgery department to be examined for a semihard, painless, slowly evolving submental augmentation which had appeared 5 years before . The intraoral examination showed a nodular mass in the floor of the mouth with some floating in palpation. Extraorally, there was a small swelling in the submental region with the skin intact. The young girl complained of a progressive dysphagia and dysarthria during the last 6 months, regardless of the previous small mass in the area.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | The semihard, painless, slowly evolving augmentation in the submental area. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【10】The (ECHO) ultrasonic scan showed an infrasonic formation with distinct boundaries .

Macroscopically, the cyst (6,5 cm long) was found to contain smegma and hairs,  indicative of a dermoid cyst, confirmed by a pathoanatomical examination which showed a cystic capsule lined by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and skin glands attached .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | The macroscopic image of the surgical l extract with clear evidence of cystic formation (6,5 cm) containing smegma and hairs, indicative of a dermoid cyst. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 | Cyst with keratinized squamous epithelium and adnexal structures in wall. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【17】##### 2.2. Case Report 2\n\n【18】A 17-year-old male patient came to the consultation unit of the maxillofacial surgery department to be examined for an inflamed, painful, and considerably large augmentation of the submaxillary area which had created a swelling in the floor of the mouth  and had appeared 2 years before.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 | The augmentation in the floor of the mouth due to the intraoral projection of the augmentation. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【20】The intraoral examination showed a round mass which slightly elevated the tongue. Extraorally there was a painful swelling in the submaxillary area which did not disappear when he opened his mouth.\n\n【21】The histopathological examination showed a cyst with keratinization in the overlying epithelium, with the presence of a sebaceous gland in the wall .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8 | Keratinizing squamous epithelium with distinct granular layer with a sebaceous gland in the cyst wall. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【23】The (ECHO) ultrasonic scan of the area  showed a sizeable infrasonic formation with distinct boundaries.

By virtue of the infection of the cyst and the surrounding anatomical elements, ampicillin antibiotic was administered per os at a dosage of 500 mg × 4 for 7 days.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 12 | The macroscopic image of the surgical extract showing the cystic formation (5,4 cm) of our second case. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【29】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【30】The term “dermoid cyst” in the floor of the mouth is used to describe three types of histologically related cysts in this area: dermoid, epidermoid, and teratomata/teratoid cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth have been the subject of a considerable number of researches. Dermoid cysts may be classified into 2 major categories: congenital and acquired forms.\n\n【31】In international bibliography, reference is made to 3 theories with regard to the origin of cysts in the floor of the mouth. According to the 1st and most prevalent theory, these cysts originate from embryonic cells of the 1st and 2nd branchial arch entrapped in the mesenchyme of the area during the 3rd/4th week of embryonic life. With regard to the 2nd theory, it explains the pathogenic mechanism of the acquired form. The acquired cysts may be due to the implantation of epithelial cells subsequent to accidental or surgical injury (traumatic causes, iatrogenic antecedents, or an occlusion of a sebaceous gland duct).\n\n【32】Lastly, the 3rd theory maintains that these cysts are considered a variation of the cyst of the thyroglossal pore 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–13\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Anatomically, it is possible to distinguish 3 different types of dermoid cysts: median genioglossal, median geniohyoid, and lateral cysts, according to the anatomic relationship between the cyst and the muscles of the floor of the mouth. So with regard to the midline, these cysts are differentially diagnosed as central and lateral cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, while with relation to the mylohyoid muscle they are differentially diagnosed as supra and inferior cysts of the mylohyoid muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 14\\]</u>. According to one point of view, lateral cysts are, in effect, central cysts which have undergone displacement due to the development of strong fibrous symphyses with the tissues of the midline. As far as another opinion is concerned, the lateral cysts constitute a separate entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【34】In histological terms, dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth are categorized according to Meyer’s classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, separating them into dermoid, epidermoid, and teratoid/teratomata cysts. Dermoid cysts have a wall of stratified squamous cornified epithelium and contain smegma and keratic scales as well as cutaneous appendages such as hair follicles, hairs, and sebaceous and sudoriparous glands. Epidermoid cysts have a wall of stratified squamous usually cornified epithelium and contain smegma and keratic scales without cutaneous appendages. Lastly, teratoid/teratomata cysts have a wall of stratified squamous epithelium with or without cornification and contain smegma and keratic scales as well as elements of the middle blastoderm such as vascular formations, elements of muscle and bone, dental tissues, or even whole teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. The latter type is the only variety that may have a malignant transformation. The clinical findings of these cysts cannot be differentially diagnosed.\n\n【35】Epidermoid cysts are less common than dermoid cysts in the head and neck region.\n\n【36】Most patients with these lesions ranged between the 2nd and 3rd decades of life. There is no predominant sex in the recent literature, regardless of some evidence which showed a male prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These cysts generally appear in the floor of the mouth, where there is a firm, usually painless, swelling, which sometimes raises the tongue. There are also symptoms of dysphagia and dysarthria and, when the lesions are quite large, dyspnea. A double-chin appearance is also common if the cyst develops below the mylohyoid muscle.\n\n【37】Depending on the position of its development and the size of the cyst, it either manifests itself as an augmentation in the submental area or as an augmentation in the floor of the mouth of a usually dough-like constitution and a double chin. In the case of a sizeable cyst, there is discomfort in chewing and in speech (croaking) or even in breathing, while in the event of infection there is rubor and pain in the area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9, 11, 14\\]</u>. The appearance of these cysts is most frequently reported in adults in their 20’ s and 30’ s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Of considerable assistance in the diagnosis of cysts in the floor of the mouth are the (ECHO) ultrasonic scan, the computed tomography (CT), the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the scintiscan of the area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 7\\]</u>. In the ultrasonic scan (ECHO), these cysts appear as infrasonic areas with ultrasonic elements; the computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging specify their size and anatomical relationship, while the scintiscan helps in their differential diagnosis from the ectopic thyroid tissue. The injection of endographine or lipiodol could assist in defining the boundaries and the size of the cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Nowadays, however, paracentesis of these cysts is usually avoided owing to their viscous content as well as the risk of their infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【39】The cysts in the floor of the mouth are differentially diagnosed with relation to a large number of diseases which occur in this area with similar symptomatology. Differential diagnosis should include developmental lesions, congenital, inflammatory, and salivary gland lesions, lymphomas, and benign tumors.\n\n【40】Developmental lesions are branchial cleft cyst, heterotopic gastrointestinal cysts, thyroglossal duct cysts, and ectopic thyroid tissue. Congenital masses include vascular malformations and lymphangiomas. Inflammatory accumulations are the Ludwig angina, cellulitis, and submandibular and sublingual space infections. Salivary gland deformities are ranula and the obstruction and dilation of the Wharton pore, cysts of the thyroid pore, pleomorphic adenoma, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Lymphomas are considerable in the area and coexist with lymphadenopathy. They are usually MALT lymphomas of low-grade extranodal B cells and often associated with autoimmune disease. Benign tumors are also rare and are of mesenchmal origin such as lipoma, schwannoma, and leiomyoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 13, 16\\]</u>. Needless to say, in all cases the conclusive confirmation of their diagnosis is effected via histopathological examination, as mentioned above 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Finally, the chosen treatment for cysts in the floor of the mouth is their total extraction (enucleation) via intraoral or extraoral approach or a combination of both, determined on each occasion by the location and size of the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6, 9, 14\\]</u>. There are no specific rules for treating these lesions because they are mainly congenital. When the symptoms include dysphagia and dyspnea, the doctor should guide the patient to undergo an operation. In most cases, the enucleation can be carried out intraorally, as clearly evident in a review of international bibliography, whereby in 194 cases of cysts of which 120 were surgically treated, 70 (58%) were done intraorally, 37 (31%) extraorally, and 13 (11%) via a combination of intra- and extraoral approaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 10\\]</u>. As regards location, out of 58 cases of sublingual approaches there are 5 reported cases of extraoral approach and 6 cases of combined approach; of 58 cases of submental approach, there are reports of 20 cases treated extraorally, 7 cases treated intraorally, and 2 treated with the combination of the intra- and extraoral approaches, while of 4 cases of submental approach, 3 cases were done via intraoral approach and 1 via extraoral approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【42】In our 2 case reports, Case  1 was treated via submental approach while Case  2 was done via intraoral approach. In Case  1, the surgical intervention yielded a dermoid cyst 6.5 cm long while in Case  2 it yielded a 5.4 cm long cyst. In both cases, the patients were observed for 2 years (at 6-month intervals) during which time there were no pathological findings. Prognosis is very good, and recurrence rate is very low and is usually related to bone remnant of the genial tubercles or of the hyoid bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【43】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【44】In conclusion, dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth are quite rare and need to be differentially diagnosed from several other diseases and conditions of the area. For their diagnosis, their clinical picture is essential involving a detailed examination of their size and anatomical location. Furthermore, invaluable assistance is provided by the ultrasonic scan, computed tomography, and scintiscan of the area. Their treatment calls for careful planning and execution of the surgical operation. The ultimate confirmation and definite diagnosis of the disease is always effected via histopathological examination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Imaging studies led to a diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome combined with internal jugular vein thrombus. We investigated the cause of thrombosis and found that the anticoagulant activity of protein C was decreased. Genetic analysis showed the presence of a c.125C>A (Arg42Ser) substitution in the protein C gene (PROC) of the proband, which generates an Arg42Ser mutation that replaces the scissile bond Arg42-Ala43 normally cleaved by a furin-like processing protease. Her father and younger brother also carried this mutation, although they had no evidence of thrombosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Budd-Chiari syndrome is defined as any pathophysiologic process, such as thrombosis, that results in an interruption or diminution of the normal flow of blood from the liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. One cause of this syndrome is a deficiency in protein C 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>, a precursor of a vitamin K-dependent serine protease that plays an important role in the regulation of blood coagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>. Heterozygous protein C deficiency is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and hereditary deficiency in this protein is associated with a high risk of thrombotic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A c.125C>A change in the protein C gene (PROC) is designated protein C Osaka 10. This mutation had been reported in only one case so far 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Although some cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome have been reported to be caused by hereditary protein C deficiency, genetic analysis of family members was not investigated.\n\n【4】To our knowledge, the present study represents the first case report describing Budd-Chiari syndrome combined with multiple thrombotic lesions and genetic analysis of family members.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 34-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of a weight gain of up to 15 kg and increased bilateral pedal edema over the preceding 3 weeks. She did not have a history of these symptoms and was not taking any medications. On admission, her pulse rate was 84 beats/min, her blood pressure was 130/84 mmHg, and her body temperature, 36.7°C. Her consciousness was alert, her bulbar conjunctiva were not icteric, and the palpebral conjunctiva were not pale. No respiratory rales or heart murmurs were noted on auscultation. Palpation revealed hepatosplenomegaly and ascites with no enlargement of the thyroid gland. Neurological abnormalities, jaundice, or palmar erythema was not evident. However, bilateral pedal edema was observed.\n\n【7】Laboratory data acquired upon admission are shown in Table 1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (46 IU/L) and D-dimer (1.40 μg/mL) were slightly elevated. Her chest X-ray and echocardiogram were normal, but carotid ultrasonography showed a thrombus of the right internal jugular vein 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. Blood flow in the right internal jugular vein was maintained and did not require immediate treatment. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly, ascites, gallbladder wall thickening, and a thrombus within the intrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a region of high-intensity, which suggested the presence of a thrombus within the inferior vena cava 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. Abdominal-pelvic CT and MRI analyses did not detect tumors. The presence of right pleural effusion and dilatation of an azygos vein were evident in CT images acquired following the injection of contrast medium 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(c))</u>. Venous angiography revealed a thrombus within the inferior vena cava at its outlet that extended to the right atrium and was accompanied by intrahepatic collaterals 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>. This patient was therefore diagnosed with Budd-Chiari syndrome.\n\n【8】Table 1 Laboratory test values of the proband upon admission.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Imaging studies.

We performed PTA with stent implantation (LUMINEXX 14 × 80 mm) and successful balloon dilatation (OPTA Pro 10 × 40 mm) from the outlet of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(c) and 2(d))</u>. The pressure of the inferior vena cava decreased after PTA from 25 mmHg to 16 mmHg. Although we prepared the operation for a case of pulmonary embolism, PTA was completed without any complications. We started treatment by administering intravenous heparin sodium (10,000 units/day). Heparin sodium infusion was discontinued 2 days after PTA, and the patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. Abdominal CT during injection of contrast medium was performed on postoperative day 10 and showed the patency of the inferior vena cava. Abdominal ultrasonography showed that hepatomegaly, ascites, and gallbladder wall thickening were diminished. Bilateral pedal edema was dramatically alleviated after 14 days.\n\n【12】We examined protein C anticoagulant activity and it was decreased to 44% (normal: 64%–146%), contributing to thrombogenesis. Protein C anticoagulant activity was decreased in her father (61%) and younger brother (62%) . While the medical histories of her younger brother and father were not informative, her younger brother had been suffering for several years from idiopathic recurrent chest pain.\n\n【13】Table 2 Analysis of clotting factors.\n\n【14】To determine whether or not the patient and her family members harbored PROC mutations, we performed genetic analyses after we obtained informed written consent. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples using a QIAamp DNA Blood MiniKit kit (Qiagen). All exons and flanking intronic regions of PROC were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then sequenced in both sense and antisense strands using an ABI Prism BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Primer sequences are available on request. A c.125C>A change that encodes an Arg42Ser mutation was identified in the patient. Arg42 is located at the cleavage site recognized by the furin-like protease that normally processes preproprotein C to its mature form.\n\n【15】This mutation was also identified in the patient’s father and younger brother, whereas the sequence of her mother’s DNA in this region was found to be wild-type . Although her younger brother did not have evidence of thrombosis, his idiopathic recurrent chest pain may be shown by pulmonary embolism due to microscopic thrombosis. And he desired administration of warfarin. Warfarin (3–6 mg/day orally) was given to the patient and younger brother according to the levels of prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (maintaining between 2.0 and 2.5). Abdominal Doppler ultrasonography, which was performed during a follow-up visit to the outpatient clinic 16 months after the procedure, showed complete patency and no ectopia of the stent 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(d))</u>. Carotid ultrasonography showed that blood flow in the right internal jugular vein was maintained.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | DNA sequence analysis.

Discussion\n\n【18】We describe here a patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome with multiple venous thrombi caused by an Arg42Ser mutation in PROC. Her father and younger brother also carried this mutation; however, they were free of detectable thrombosis. Her mother was genetically unaffected.\n\n【19】Budd-Chiari syndrome is defined as any pathophysiologic process that results in an interruption or diminution of the normal flow of blood out of the liver. This presentation is uncommon, often dramatic illness characterized by abdominal pain, ascites, hepatomegaly and a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The diagnosis can be established noninvasively by ultrasonography with Doppler studies, CT scan, or magnetic resonance angiography (MRI angiography) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. Treatment depends upon the cause, the anatomic location, and extent of the thrombotic process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The etiology of Budd-Chiari syndrome, a rare disorder, is varied, and its cause remains unknown in most patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Analysis of 157 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome in Japan revealed that 141 were idiopathic, 2 were deficient in protein C, 2 were deficient in protein S, and 1 was deficient in antithrombin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Protein C deficiency is one of the causes of Budd-Chiari syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Protein C is the precursor of a vitamin K-dependent serine protease that plays an important role in the regulation of blood coagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>. The observed molecular mass of protein C is approximately 62 kDa, accounted for by one light chain (21 kDa) and one heavy chain (41 kDa), which are connected by a disulfide bridge. The primary effect of activated protein C is to inactivate coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, which are necessary for the efficient generation of thrombin and the activation of factor X. Congenital protein C deficiency is most often transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with varying degrees of penetrance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Heterozygous protein C deficiency is an important independent risk factor for the development of deep vein thrombosis, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> characterized by recurrent venous thrombosis. In this case, c.125C>A PROC mutation was identified in the proband, where CGT encoding Arg42 at the furin-like processing enzyme cleavage site was changed to AGT encoding Ser. This mutation abolishes the cleavage site required for production of mature protein C molecule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In this mutation, the specificity of the processing protease would be shifted to a Lys-Ser bond to produce mutant protein C with loss of anticoagulant activity. Protein C Osaka 10 showed normal amidolytic activity and a normal protein C antigen level; however, it had an anticoagulant activity of only about 50% compared to that of the wild-type protein. This mutation is characterized as type 2 protein C deficiency. In this case, protein C antigen of the patient and her younger brother was decreased by administration of warfarin .\n\n【21】In a study of 173 patients with deep vein thrombosis, 55 (32%) were found to carry mutations in genes encoding protein S, protein C, and antithrombin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, deficiency of protein C occurs in a variety of other conditions, such as severe liver disorders, the nephrotic syndrome, acute respiratory distress, and postoperative states 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>, suggesting the importance of extending investigations of PROC particularly to patients suffering from multiple thrombi. The frequency of heterozygous protein C deficiency may be as high as 1/200 to 1/500 in healthy adults; however, those affected do not exhibit thrombotic manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>. This study also indicates that other unidentified factors may play an important role in the clinical signs of thrombosis formation.\n\n【22】The patient, her father, and younger brother described here express Protein C Osaka 10. However, her father and younger brother showed no detectable thrombi. The implementation of primary prophylaxis with aspirin, heparin, or warfarin is often considered in known familial cases. Anticoagulant prophylaxis is given to all patients who develop a venous clot regardless of the underlying cause. Patients with protein C deficiency are at increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolic events. Long term anticoagulation therapy using warfarin may be considered in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Therefore, we believe that familial screening for PROC mutations could avoid new thrombotic complications as well as improving the long term prognosis of the patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome caused by protein C deficiency.\n\n【23】We suggest a hypothesis to account for the absence of detectable thrombosis in our patient’s family members, these individuals harbored the same mutation as our patient with a concomitant decrease in protein C activity. The hypothesis maintains that elevated levels of total cholesterol may be a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Studies on the association between lipid profile and VTE are inconsistent, with some reporting that total cholesterol is the risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>, while others report that lipid levels do not influence the risk of VTE; however, the levels of LDL are significantly associated with unprovoked VTE as revealed by univariate analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Further, statins can prevent VTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. The levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in our patient (total cholesterol, 299 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol, 195 mg/dL) were higher than those of her younger brother (total cholesterol, 234 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol; 161 mg/dL) and father (total cholesterol, 200 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol, 99 mg/dL). Moreover, we noted no recurrence of thrombosis after statins were administered to our patient.\n\n【24】In summary, we describe here a case of Budd-Chiari syndrome with multiple venous thrombi caused by an Arg42Ser mutation in PROC and in two of three of her family members without detectable thrombosis. Thus, the patient’s brother and father did not experience thrombotic events, even though they harbored the same mutation with a concomitant decrease in protein C activity. Further, the difference between the patient’s complicated thrombosis and family members with no thrombosis, even though they all harbor the same PROC mutation, may be associated with lipid levels. Therefore, the contribution of this mutation to thrombogenicity remains to be determined.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Therapy was indicated due to persistent and progressive symptoms of encephalopathy. Although an open surgical approach was considered, the multidisciplinary liver tumor group elected an initial percutaneous interventional approach. The procedure was performed with intravenous moderate sedation and local anesthesia. The left branch of the portal vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle from an anterior abdominal approach, under real time US guidance. After placement of a 10 cm 5 Fr vascular sheath, a 4 Fr Bernstein catheter (Cook, Inc. Bloomington, IL) was directed into the main portal vein over a 0.035-inch angled glide-wire (Terumo Medical Corp. Somerset, NJ). Portal venography demonstrated two large right portal anterior and posterior venous branches communicating with the right hepatic veins through aneurysmal connections 删除1:<u>(Figures 5(a) and 5(b))</u>. There was a 28 mm aneurysm associated with the anterior portohepatic venous shunt 删除1:<u>(Figure 5(a))</u> and a 37 mm aneurysm associated with posterior portohepatic shunt 删除1:<u>(Figure 5(b))</u>. Over a 0.035-inch Rosen wire, the 10 cm sheath was exchanged for a 25 cm 5 Fr sheath. The 4 Fr Bernstein catheter was advanced over the 0.035-inch angled glide-wire into the anterior right portal vein branch to its communication with the right hepatic vein. A 6 mm Amplatzer II vascular plug (St Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) was used to occlude the right anterior portal vein proximal to the communication with the right hepatic vein. The 4 Fr Bernstein catheter was then directed to the posterior right portal vein branch that supplied the second shunt. A 12 mm Amplatzer vascular plug was placed to occlude the posterior right portal vein branch. After occlusion of anterior and posterior right portal vein branches, a portal venogram was obtained with catheter tip in the main portal vein, which confirmed an absence of flow in the occluded branches with no opacification of the aneurysms 删除1:<u>(Figure 5(c))</u>.

Her moderate postprocedure RUQ pain was managed with intravenous hydromorphone. There was improvement of her RUQ pain and swelling at one-week postprocedure follow-up. US and Doppler assessment of the liver performed one month after embolization demonstrated thrombosis of the portohepatic communications and associated aneurysms. The patient had complete resolution of the presenting symptoms and was asymptomatic at 6-month follow-up.\n\n【14】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Stringer described four major different varieties of congenital portosystemic venous shunts in six children seen during a 10-year period, with reference to anatomy of the shunt which was determined by imaging studies and surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. He divided extrahepatic portocaval shunts into two types: first, end-to-side shunts, where the portal vein (PV) terminates in the inferior vena cava (IVC), and the second, side-to-side shunts in which there is venous communication between a patent PV and the IVC. The third and fourth types of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts were abnormal intrahepatic connections between branches of the PV and the hepatic veins or IVC and persistent patent ductus venosus.\n\n【16】An intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt (IPSVS) is a communication between an intrahepatic portal vein and a systemic vein via an anomalous intrahepatic venous channel. The etiology of IPSVS may be congenital or acquired (secondary to cirrhosis, trauma, or biopsy procedure). The intrahepatic portal venous shunt in adults is most commonly due to portal venous communication to a systemic vein secondary to portal hypertension. While portosystemic shunts less than 2 mm in diameter are relatively common in patients with cirrhosis, the larger shunts are thought to be congenital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Popper et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> described many minute communications between the portal and hepatic veins in cirrhotic livers. These anastomoses were considered to be remnants of previous sinusoids that had dilated and whose walls had become thickened in areas of liver cell loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our case is likely to be congenital as these were relatively large communications and there was no associated evidence of chronic liver disease or prior history of trauma to the liver.\n\n【17】In the embryonic period, there are three pairs of veins that participate in the formation of venous structures within and around the liver: right and left vitelline veins, umbilical veins, and cardinal veins. The portal vein is formed from several segments of the vitelline veins while some segments of the right and left vitelline veins collapse and disappear during the process of development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. According to Raskin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> “a persistence of portions of the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) venous system from the second month of fetal life is the most likely explanation for the portohepatic venous malformation.”\n\n【18】Some small intrahepatic portosystemic shunts  located between the portal branches and hepatic veins disappear spontaneously by age 1 to 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. If larger shunts or the ductus venosus persists, they pose a risk of late development of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, pulmonary hypertension, or hyperammonemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6, 7\\]</u>. The clinical significance of IPSVS depends upon the shunt ratio and on the patient’s age. Decreasing tolerance of the brain to toxic metabolites with increasing age may explain the delayed clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Table 1 Summary of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts.\n\n【20】Two shunts in one patient are also relatively rare. Remer et al. found three out of twenty-two (13.6%) had two intrahepatic portal venous shunts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The incidence of portal vein aneurysm in association with portosystemic shunts is not uniform in the literature. Tanoue et al. found that portal vein aneurysms were reported in 5 (50%) of 10 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Color Doppler ultrasonography (US) is the key imaging modality for the diagnosis of congenital portosystemic shunt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Doppler US is also useful for follow-up after therapy. In addition to demonstrating flow signals between the involved vessels, and evaluating flow direction, it may also determine the shunt ratio by estimating flow volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. The shunt ratio is calculated by dividing the blood flow volume through the shunt by the total portal blood flow volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 14\\]</u>. When the shunt ratio increases, the amount of nitrogen-containing substances in the portal blood that bypass the hepatic metabolism rises in the systemic circulation and can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. When the shunt ratio exceeds 30%, hepatic encephalopathy may develop at any time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. When the shunt ratio exceeds 60%, the risk of hepatic encephalopathy is increased, such that, in noncirrhotic patients even without encephalopathy, therapeutic intervention is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Multidetector computed tomography (CT) with contrast is useful for pretreatment planning, to document the anatomy and location of the shunt. With use of maximum intensity projection and multiplanar reconstruction, it provides all the necessary information about the course of the shunt, its size, and orientation; it helps to define the best access route for intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. MRI with contrast of the abdomen can also well visualize the shunt anatomy without radiation risk. Confirmation with CT or MRI is valuable when there is suboptimal sonographic visualization of the liver and can exclude associated abnormalities such as liver tumors.\n\n【23】Recently, Lautz et al. classified shunts based on portal anatomy and expected physiologic consequences of the shunt , regardless of whether they were intrahepatic or extrahepatic; type I shunts were those with no intrahepatic portal flow and type II shunts were partial shunts with some preserved intrahepatic flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Type II shunt was further classified based on portal anatomy; type IIa arises from a portal branch, type IIb is from the main portal vein, its bifurcation, or the splenomesenteric confluence, and type IIc includes shunts from mesenteric veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Table 2 Classification of congenital PSVS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. CAPV indicates congenital absence of the portal vein.\n\n【25】Other vascular abnormalities of the liver such as cavernous transformation of the portal vein, arterioportal shunts, and aneurysm of the portal vein are in the differential diagnosis. These can be differentiated from IPSVS by imaging findings. Cavernous transformation of the portal vein is due to the formation of venous channels within and around a previously stenosed or occluded portal vein that act as portoportal collateral channels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. A characteristic beaded appearance (mass of veins) at the porta hepatis is usually seen on contrast enhanced CT scans due to dilated biliary and gastric veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18–20\\]</u>. Arterioportal shunts are due to communication between the hepatic artery and the portal venous system. This condition is diagnosed in helical CT performed during the hepatic arterial phase showing early and marked enhancement of the main portal vein or major tributaries with attenuation similar to that of the aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Aneurysms of the portal venous system may be present in patients with liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. On contrast enhanced CT or MRI, an aneurysm appears as an enhancing cystic mass that arises from the portal venous system and demonstrates simultaneous enhancement with portal vein.\n\n【26】Invasive studies such as arterial portography or direct percutaneous transhepatic portography can confirm the presence of portosystemic shunts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Symptomatic portosystemic shunts warrant therapeutic intervention. Treatment options include percutaneous embolization or surgical shunt ligation and/or hepatic resection. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment of congenital absence of the portal vein (type I Abernethy malformation) and is reserved for patients with refractory symptoms despite medical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 18\\]</u>. Type II PSVS has variable anatomy, clinical features, and treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Lautz et al. reported 10 symptomatic children with type II PSVS who were successfully managed with operative ligation (), endovascular occlusion (), and a combined approach (). Endovascular occlusion (using coils, plugs, and/or stents) has proven successful for patent ductus venosus (PDV) and other isolated type IIa shunts whereas type IIb shunt usually requires staged operative closure because of short and wide diameter of the shunt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Type IIc can be managed either with surgical ligation or endovascular occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Percutaneous closure of the shunts can be performed when an occlusive device can be fixed in position in the shunt, without compromising the flow in the inferior vena cava and the normal hepatic veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. This endovascular therapeutic option applies to shunts between portal branches and hepatic veins that can be closed by means of Amplatzer occlusive devices or embolic metallic coils, which depends on the size, position, and number of communications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Advantages of percutaneous embolization are the less invasive procedure and preservation of hepatic parenchyma. This is particularly important when faced with a lesion in the setting of cirrhosis and portal hypertension where preservation of hepatic parenchyma is desired 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【27】After closure of the shunt, liver tests and coagulation studies should return to normal. Hyperammonemia usually normalizes within a day and serum bile acids should be normal after a few days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 22\\]</u>. Sustained clinical follow-up is necessary to exclude return of symptoms that are secondary to recanalization of an occluded shunt or enlargement of other anomalous portosystemic communications.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】Congenital intrahepatic shunts between the portal and hepatic veins are rare vascular abnormalities that may cause hepatic encephalopathy. Abdominal sonography with color Doppler is an excellent method to identify these lesions. Confirmation with CT or MRI is valuable when there is suboptimal sonographic visualization of the liver, to identify associated abnormalities, and for treatment planning. This pathologic condition can be successfully treated with percutaneous interventional occlusive techniques or surgical closure.\n\n【30】#### Abbreviations\n\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| --- | --- |\n| CAPV: | Congenital absence of the portal vein |\n| Fr: | French scale commonly used to measure the size of a catheter |\n| IPSVS: | Intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt |\n| IVC: | Inferior vena cava |\n| PDV: | Patent ductus venosus |\n| PSVS: | Portosystemic venous shunt |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| RUQ: | Right upper quadrant. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Systemic examinations revealed no evidence of malignant or occult primary lesion in the bilateral mammary glands or in other organs. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed for the locally advanced axillary tumor and reduced the tumor to 55 mm in size, and, then, he could undergo complete resection with a negative surgical margin in combination with reconstructive surgery to fill the resulting skin defect with a local flap of the latissimus dorsi muscle.

Immunohistochemically, both of the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) were positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) was negative. And, the immunoexpression of proliferation factor Ki67 was high (about 24%). These findings were strongly suggestive of mammary carcinoma originating in an accessory mammary gland in the axilla. We regarded the axillary tumor as locally advanced accessory breast cancer that was difficult to resect completely and, therefore, planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | The histological examination of the incisional biopsy specimen revealed proliferation of atypical cells of variable size in the subcutis.

The tumor was finally reduced to 55 mm in diameter, and the partial response to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy was also confirmed by CT 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Wide radical excision was then performed with preservation of the axillary vein and brachial plexus, despite suspicious involvement of the tumor. Radical axillary lymph node dissection was also performed, as well as subsequent reconstructive surgery to fill the resulting skin defect with a local flap of the latissimus dorsi muscle to preserve shoulder joint movement.\n\n【11】The final pathological examination of the surgical specimen showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma compatible with invasive ductal breast carcinoma, which was the same as the result obtained with the earlier excisional biopsy. And, the decrease of immunoexpression of Ki67 due to the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was confirmed. There was no evidence of intraductal components or lymph node structures in the specimen. The surgical margin was negative. Accordingly, a course of hormone therapy (tamoxifen at 20 mg/day) was started after surgery. The patient has not presented with any metastatic lesions in the four years since the operation and has been receiving hormone therapy.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Accessory mammary carcinoma is very rare, occurring in only 0.3%–0.6% of all cases of breast cancer and usually appears as an axillary tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Accessory mammary tissue develops due to incomplete embryologic regression of the mammary ridge, which is composed of a portion of the galactic band that runs from the axilla to the groin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Generally, accessory breast cancer must be pathologically demonstrated to be located adjacent to normal breast ducts or lobules that are not connected with the proper mammary gland, and it is also necessary to exclude the possibility of a metastatic lesion from another primary cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【14】In our case, systemic examinations including CT, MRI, US, and PET/CT revealed no primary malignant or occult lesions, only the axillary tumor. Although pathological examination did not show such findings as isolated normal breast tissue or intraductal spread adjacent to the main lesion in the specimen, the tumor was morphologically compatible with mammary carcinoma, and immunohistochemical study revealed ER- and PgR-positive cells. Thus, we diagnosed the axillary tumor as primary breast cancer arising in an accessory mammary gland. In any case, it is most important to plan proper therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.\n\n【15】In the previous literature, it has been reported that in males the incidence of accessory breast cancer is higher than that of the usual form of breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In addition, at the time of diagnosis the majority of accessory breast cancer patients were in an advanced clinical stage, with nodal metastasis or unresectable tumor size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. Thus, the prognosis of accessory breast cancer may be worse than that of breast cancer arising in proper mammary gland, although no long-term follow-up data regarding the prognosis of accessory breast cancer is available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In our case, the patient presented with a locally advanced axillary tumor, which could not be removed completely, and the patient, therefore, underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As a result, the lesion was reduced in size after 6 courses of FEC chemotherapy, and it was clinically considered as a partial response. There have been few reports on neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a treatment for locally advanced accessory breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. Chemotherapy with anthracycline and taxane is generally recommended for the treatment of locally advanced accessory breast cancer, as for the usual form of breast cancer. One report on a locally advanced case indicated radical resection with reconstructive surgery for complete excision with a negative surgical margin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Our patient underwent reconstructive surgery to fill the resulting skin defect with a local flap of the latissimus dorsi muscle to preserve shoulder joint movement. Reconstructive surgery must be recommended to relieve the negative effects of radical resection, including a large skin defect.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】In this paper, we have described a very rare case of a male breast carcinoma arising in an accessory mammary gland. This case shows that neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an effective and tolerated therapy for advanced accessory breast cancer in the axilla, leading to curative resection combined with subsequent reconstructive surgery. We should take into account the possibility of accessory mammary carcinoma even in a male patient with adenocarcinoma in the axilla.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Here, we report a case of primary bone marrow DLBCL successfully treated with high-dose chemotherapy and rescued by in vivo rituximab-purged autologous stem cells. A 39-year-old woman visited our hospital because of anemia. Bone marrow examination revealed a large B-cell lymphoma invasion. An通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18</sup></u>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan revealed disseminated bone marrow uptake without evidence of dissemination at other sites. These findings led to a diagnosis of primary bone marrow DLBCL. Our patient underwent R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. Subsequently, she received high-dose chemotherapy with an in vivo rituximab-purged autologous stem cell transplant. Seven years have passed since the transplantation, and she remains in remission. This suggests that transplantation of an in vivo rituximab-purged autograft is a promising strategy for primary bone marrow DLBCL.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The involvement of bone marrow in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) usually represents the systemic dissemination of lymphoma. However, a rare type of DLBCL involving the bone marrow alone, known as primary bone marrow DLBCL, has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. The prognosis of primary bone marrow DLBCL is poor with a median survival of 14.9 months, and approximately 70% of patients die within 2 years despite receiving chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue is an effective treatment strategy for high-risk non-Hodgkin lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Furthermore, treatment with rituximab in addition to stem cell mobilization or a conditioning regimen has been reported to improve the outcome in patients with high-risk B-cell lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. High-dose chemotherapy rescued by in vivo rituximab-purged autologous stem cells is a reasonable approach for primary bone marrow DLBCL because the risk of lymphoma cells being contaminated in the autograft is high. Here, we present a case of a patient with primary bone marrow DLBCL who achieved long-term remission (at least 7 years) after high-dose chemotherapy rescued by in vivo rituximab-purged autologous stem cells.\n\n【5】The present case suggests that this strategy may enable the cure of patients with primary bone marrow DLBCL.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 39-year-old woman suffering from dyspnea on exertion was admitted to our hospital. On physical examination, her body temperature was 37.0°C, the conjunctiva was anemic, but neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly was observed.\n\n【8】Laboratory findings showed a decreased white blood cell count of 2,950 × 10<sup>6</sup>/L, a low hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL, an increased soluble interleukin-2 receptor level of 3,350 U/mL, and a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase level of 154 U/L.

Our patient received an additional 2 courses of R-CHOP, followed by stem cell mobilization chemotherapy consisting of 24 mg/day dexamethasone (days 1 to 10), 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> carmustine (day 2), 75 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> etoposide (days 4 to 7), 200 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> cytarabine (days 4 to 7), 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> melphalan (day 3), and 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> rituximab (day 1), which was started 40 days after the completion of the last course of R-CHOP. Filgrastim at a dose of 600 μg was administered on day 11 and continued until the completion of leukapheresis. Leukapheresis was performed using a continuous-flow blood cell separator (Cobe Spectra, Lakewood, CO, USA), and a total of 7.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/kg body weight were obtained.\n\n【13】Two weeks after stem cell collection, our patient received a conditioning regimen of 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> carmustine (day −6), 100 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> etoposide (days −5 to −2), 200 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> cytarabine (days −5 to −2), 140 mg/m<sup>2</sup> melphalan (day −1), and 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> rituximab (day −9), followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).

Engraftment of neutrophils (ANC > 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>/L) was performed on day +11. Seven years have passed since the transplantation and the patient remains in remission 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Primary bone marrow DLBCL is a rare but distinctive entity of extranodal lymphoma with a poor prognosis.\n\n【16】Because primary bone marrow DLBCL is rare, no standard therapy has been established. Chang et al. reported 8 cases of primary bone marrow DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Four patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, of which 3 died at 8, 10, and 22 months after the initial diagnosis. In contrast, of the 4 patients treated with chemotherapy combined with rituximab (R-CHOP, 3 patients; R-COP, 1 patient), 3 have remained in remission for 3, 10, and 14 months. These results suggest that similar to other types of DLBCL, chemotherapy combined with rituximab would be a standard strategy for primary bone marrow DLBCL too. However, the long-term outcome is unknown because the followup period is too short.\n\n【17】Although high-dose chemotherapy rescued by autograft is known to improve the outcome of relapsed lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, the role of upfront ASCT for the patients with DLBCL is controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Presently upfront ASCT is recommended only in selected high-risk circumstances or in the context of clinical trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Although primary bone marrow DLBCL is thought to be a type of high-risk lymphoma, the role of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is unclear because of its extremely rare incidence. To date, 3 cases of primary bone marrow DLBCL (including the present one) treated by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been reported, all of which have remained in remission for 14 months, 12 months, and 7 years (our patient) after transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】In patients with primary bone marrow DLBCL, the high risk of lymphoma cells in the autograft being contaminated is a major problem because it may cause relapse. Therefore, an in vivo rituximab-purged autograft was used for transplantation in our patient. She has been alive without evidence of relapse for the past 7 years. This suggests that ASCT using an in vivo rituximab-purged autograft might be a promising strategy for the treatment of primary bone marrow DLBCL.\n\n【19】However, because this is only a case report, the role of ASCT in curing primary bone marrow DLBCL remains unclear. An accumulation of cases is required to clarify the role of ASCT with an in vivo rituximab-purged autograft for primary bone marrow DLBCL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It may occur due to many causes, such as the presence of other disorders such as HIV infection, congenital anomalies like oculocutaneous albinism, or Oliver–McFarlane syndrome. It may be linked to the use of certain drugs and can also be present as an isolated trait by birth. Here, we report a rare case of eyelash trichomegaly in a 19-year-old female having diffused alopecia, diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Eyelash trichomegaly is defined as a condition in which eyelashes exceed their normal length (12 mm or more), curling, pigmentation, or thickness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Gray, in 1944, for the first time, used the term “trichomegaly” while observing a lymphoma patient with abnormally long eyelashes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This disease may occur as a clinical feature associated with other acquired or congenital diseases. The common congenital anomalies associated with this condition include oculocutaneous albinism or Oliver–McFarlane syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome, while the most common acquired conditions to which it is linked include HIV infection, alopecia areata, diseases affecting connective tissues like dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Certain medications such as cyclosporines and topical latanoprost can also trigger eyelash trichomegaly. The exact mechanism by which it develops has not been extensively studied. A summary of the conditions which may trigger trichomegaly is given in Table 1.\n\n【5】Table 1 Eyelash trichomegaly: causes and occurrence.\n\n【6】Here, we present a case of eyelash trichomegaly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Hair loss in a diffused pattern is also present in the patient. All information presented here were obtained with the permission of the patient’s parents.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【8】For nine months, a Jordanian girl, 19 years old , had typical symptoms such as weakness, malaise, joint discomfort, no or diminished appetite, sensitivity to sunlight, and low-grade fever. Since last year, she has seen hair loss as well as an increase in the length and curl of her eyelashes.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Eyelash trichomegaly in SLE patient.</u>\n\n【10】Her medical record for the last six months showed that she had taken no medicine except prednisolone orally (20 mg/day). Her family history shows no cases of hypertrichosis. Mild signs and symptoms such as erythema in the paranasal region and diffused hair loss in the scalp were discovered during the examination (classified as type-1 according to Ebling and Rook’s five-stage classification of hair loss pattern for females). Trichomegaly was observed as her eyelashes measured 17 mm long .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Eyelash trichomegaly in SLE patient.</u>\n\n【12】Hb 9.8 g/dL, TLC 2800/mm<sup>3</sup>, ESR 72 mm/h, and the number of platelets present were 105,000/mm<sup>3</sup> indicative of thrombocytopenia, which were all found on her hematological reports. No proteins or casts were seen in the urine examination. Antinuclear antibodies (1 : 320, homogeneous pattern) and anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected. The patient was diagnosed with SLE and was directed to consult a rheumatologist for treatment.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】During development at embryonic stages, eyelashes are the first hair to grow. They appear roughly around the 12<sup>th</sup> week of gestation. Their growth completes in a cycle of three stages in six months: anagen phase (30 days), catagen phase (15 days), and telogen phase (over 100 days).\n\n【15】The normal length of eyelashes of the eyelid is 8–12 mm. An increase of this length or thickening, curling, and pigmentation is known to be eyelash trichomegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. It may be present at birth in association with other congenital syndromes, which include Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Oliver–McFarlane syndrome (most common), Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome, and congenital heart disease (uncommon) and Aghaei–Dastgheib syndrome, cone-rod syndrome, Goldstein–Hutt syndrome, and phylloid hypomelanosis (rare).\n\n【16】It may also show up as an isolated benign family feature in rare cases. These changes also develop as a characteristic feature of other syndromes developed later in life, such as atopic dermatitis, uveitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and HIV infection. In rare cases, it may also be associated with other acquired syndromes such as alopecia areata, metastatic renal adenocarcinoma, dermatomyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【17】Certain drugs are also key players in the development of these changes. The drugs to which this condition is linked most commonly include cyclosporine, inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cetuximab, and frequent use of prostaglandin analogs such as latanoprost and travoprost 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u> .\n\n【18】SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease involving multiple systems. The autoantibodies which are produced cause a wide spectrum of medical complications. Hair growth patterns change as a result of SLE. In the classification criteria, nonscarring alopecia has also been included 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Diffuse alopecia affects up to 50% of patients, and uncontrolled, short, broken-off “lupus hair,” which affects 30% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The pathophysiology of eyelash trichomegaly has been inadequately explored because of a lack of histology and organ culture data for eyelash hair. A molecular mechanism for trichomegaly development has been proposed. According to this theory, stem cell inactivation in different regions of the hair follicle by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) may lead to eyelash trichomegaly. EGFR regulates the growth cycle of eyelash hairs, and its inhibition may lead to trichomegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【20】In this report, we document a case of trichomegaly associated with SLE along with diffused hair loss.

During the course of the disease, her respiratory symptoms remained mild; however, she developed acute pancreatitis leading to severe hypertension and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Herein, we report a case of acute pancreatitis, leading to severe hypertension and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 65-year-old Hispanic woman with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, end-stage renal disease, hypothyroidism, and morbid obesity was diagnosed with COVID-19 based on a routine PCR test at her hemodialysis facility. About two weeks later, she presented to our hospital with confusion, intractable nausea, vomiting, increased cough, and shortness of breath for 2 days. While the patient has been on atorvastatin, carvedilol, bumetanide, hydralazine, clonidine, detemir insulin, glipizide, glyburide, and levothyroxine, she has not been able to take her medications in the last 2 days due to severity of nausea and vomiting and missed her dialysis sessions. Her social history was negative for smoking or intake of alcoholic beverages. On arrival, her vital signs indicated blood pressure of 222/94 mmHg, pulse rate of 67/min, respiratory rate of 15/min, and temperature of 36.6°C with SpO2 of 96% on 2 L/min nasal cannula. Initial lab work indicated blood glucose of 1661 mg/dL with bicarbonate of 30.6 mmol/L, normal anion gap, and BNP of 1,810.0 pg/mL . The patient was started on insulin and nicardipine drips which improved her blood pressure and blood glucose level. Chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates with pulmonary congestion, and the patient was treated with azithromycin and ceftriaxone for COVID-19 pneumonia. Due to hyperglycemia, steroids were not started at the presentation. For treatment of severe hypertension and pulmonary edema, hemodialysis was performed. After improvement in her mental state, she reported severe epigastric abdominal with radiation to back, escalating since one day prior to hospitalization. Serum lipase was elevated (1,142 U/L; reference range: 11–82) and CT scan demonstrated diffuse edematous enlargement of the pancreas with moderate pancreatic infiltrative stranding and fluid. No gallstones, biliary dilatation, or biliary filling defects were observed. Further etiologic assessment of pancreatitis was negative for alcohol intake, hypercalcemia, severe hypertriglyceridemia, or offending medications. With continuing supportive management, patient tolerated oral intake. Five days later, she was discharged upon decrease in lipase to 261 U/L, improved blood pressure, improved glycemic control, and return to normal oxygenation.\n\n【6】Table 1 Laboratory findings.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【8】Considering the presenting symptoms, signs, and the lab work, it seems that the patient has been experiencing acute pancreatitis, which due to intractable nausea and vomiting led to medication non-adherence and subsequently severe hypertension and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.\n\n【9】In individuals with COVID-19, elevated pancreatic enzymes were reported in about 12.1–17% of cases in different reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5, 7\\]</u>. Further, increased serum amylase and lipase to more than three times of upper normal limit has been reported in cases without diagnosis of acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Although obstructing common bile duct stones, alcohol consumption, hypertriglyceridemia, medications, traumas, and severe medical conditions comprise the majority of the underlying causes of acute pancreatitis, infectious etiologies may account for about 10% of encounters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In such cases, paramyxoviruses such as mumps and measles viruses, enteroviruses, namely, Coxsackie B viruses and hepatitis A virus, and Epstein–Barr virus from Herpesviridae are the most well-known etiologies of acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Currently, about fifty cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported in the literature in individuals with COVID-19. Nevertheless, there are several shortcomings in many of these reports which makes it difficult to assume causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and acute pancreatitis. In brief, in some of the reports, cases do not meet the diagnostic criteria of acute pancreatitis based on Atlanta classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> . In many reports, common causes of acute pancreatitis have not been clearly ruled out . Further, in some of the cases, diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and hospitalization preceded diagnosis of COVID-19 or positive SARS-CoV-2 test, which may suggest that COVID-19 has occurred as a nosocomial infection rather than serving as the etiology of the acute pancreatitis, as reported in 5 individuals with acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, in our case, 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> COVID-19 was diagnosed about two weeks prior to hospitalization and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the major etiologies of acute pancreatitis including common bile duct stone, alcohol consumption, hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, trauma, and offensive mediations were clearly ruled out.\n\n【11】Similar to other viral etiologies underlying acute pancreatitis, it is not clear if involvement of the pancreas is directly related to invasion of the virus to the pancreatic tissue and subsequent direct cytopathic effect of local SARS-CoV-2 replication or it is a consequence of immune reaction to the virus, leading to destruction of the pancreatic tissue as a naïve bystander. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Single-cell RNA analysis as well as protein expression on autopsies has shown that pancreatic ductal and acinar cells co-express these molecules, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can enter pancreatic ductal cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. Notably, messenger RNA level of ACE2 might be higher in the pancreas than in the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Also, expression of ACE2 is increased in diabetic murine models and diabetic donors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. Coronaviruses were reported to cause acute pancreatitis in ferrets and pigeons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. In cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, autopsies revealed pancreatitis without clinical suspicion of pancreatitis in 25–45.5% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 PCR was found positive in pancreas pseudocyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> suggesting that the virus may be directly present in the pancreatic tissue during the course of acute pancreatitis.

She presented with recurrent hospitalizations for frequent exacerbations. After lung reduction, the patient displayed improvement in functional status without hospitalizations at the 15-month follow-up. Careful history taking is essential for any patients diagnosed with lower lobe emphysema to elucidate the underlying etiology. This case challenges the notion that basilar emphysema is sensitive or specific for AATD and emphasizes that this pattern of emphysema has a broad differential diagnosis and alternative etiologies should be considered. Our patient was ultimately diagnosed with smoking-related emphysema, with atypical bibasilar involvement. Furthermore, basilar predominant emphysema should be considered a separate entity from its apical predominant counterpart.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and severe disease involving airflow obstruction, of which one manifestation is emphysema. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an underrecognized genetic disorder involving the SERPINA1 gene, which causes Z-type alpha-1 antitrypsin molecules to form polymers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Polymerization prevents secretion of the alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) molecules into the bloodstream, leading to the destruction of the lung parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. This destruction predominantly affects the lower lobes, causing a bibasilar pattern of emphysema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However, not all lower lobe emphysematous disease is due to AATD, and it is important to recognize that this pattern of emphysema can be seen in other etiologies including Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome, occupational exposures, intravenous injection of crushed methylphenidate tablets, and tobacco use.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 59-year-old female with a history of cigarette smoking, obstructive sleep apnea, and Stage IV COPD on supplemental oxygen presented for evaluation of surgical management of her lung disease. Within the past year, she had five hospitalizations or emergency room visits for COPD exacerbations. She experienced increasing difficulty with physical activities despite using portable oxygen. She endorsed compliance with her medications, which include an albuterol inhaler and nebulized solution, fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanter, omeprazole, and roflumilast. She previously worked at a chocolate factory but denied known exposure to fumes or chemicals. She was born and raised in the United States and denied any recent travel. Additionally, she denied any history of childhood pneumonia or respiratory problems. Family history was unremarkable. She quit smoking 15 months prior to the presentation but had a total 41 pack-year history. She denied using vaporized tobacco. She endorsed occasional drinking and denied any illicit drug use, including injection drug use. AAT level was 169 mg/dL and genotype PI  MM, which were inconsistent with a diagnosis of AATD. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) demonstrated an obstructive pattern with FEV1 0.71L (28%), FVC 1.36L (38%), FEV1/FVC ratio 0.56, TLC 7.9L (150% of predicted), and DLCO 26%. Right heart catheterization showed mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 25 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance 3.76 Woods units. Chest X-rays showed bilateral lung hyperinflation, diaphragm flattening, and hyperlucency , and CT chest showed panlobular emphysema with predominantly lower lobe involvement . A 3D reconstruction of the CT showed decreased lung fields on bilaterally lower lobes and the left upper lobe . Due to her progressive symptoms, she underwent bronchoscopic lung volume reduction of the lower lobes. The left lower lobe was intervened first, with the placement of 8 Zephyr valves, followed by her right lower lobe two months later with 6 Zephyr valves placed. She tolerated both procedures well, without complication, and was promptly discharged home. In the 15 months following her BLVR, she has not had any urgent care visits or hospitalizations, requires no supplemental oxygen, and reports increased exercise tolerance. Repeat PFT showed improvements including FEV1 1.07L (40%), FVC 1.77L (60%), FEV1/FVC ratio 0.56, TLC 6.1L (115% of predicted), and DLCO 30%.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Chest X-rays of posterioanterior and lateral view showing bilateral lung hyperinflation, diaphragm flattening, and hyperlucency.</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 CT chest of upper and lower lobes showing panlobular emphysema with predominantly lower lobe involvement.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 CT chest 3D reconstruction showing decreased lung field on bilaterally lower lobes and the left upper lobe.</u>\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】The distribution of emphysema in a patient can be helpful in determining the underlying cause of the emphysema and has their own distinct differential diagnoses. Lower lobe disease is distinct from its upper lobe counterpart in severity of impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, physiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, and increased mortality with LVRS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this patient, the differential diagnosis for lower lobe emphysema is broad and can be distinguished by careful history-taking, including smoking/drug use, occupational exposure, family history, and childhood infections. Here, we discuss each diagnosis considered.\n\n【11】AATD is an underrecognized disease with pulmonary and hepatic manifestations. The proposed mechanism for emphysema is the imbalance between a serine protease and its inhibitor leading to parenchymal destruction. Cigarette smoking and recurrent infections often accelerate AATD progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. AATD should be suspected in patients with emphysema diagnosed at a young age (<45 years old), nonsmokers, a family history of early lung disease, or basilar predominant distribution. Diagnosis is confirmed by low AATs followed by genotyping showing homozygous Z alleles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. One rare genotype of AATD is the FF genotype. The F allele produces a normal quantity yet dysfunctional AAT, and thus, the risk of pulmonary manifestation is similar to that of ZZ AATD. Simultaneous testing of both the AAT level and genotype is preferred. The patient’s AAT level and genotype were determined to be inconsistent with AATD.\n\n【12】Intravenous drug use of crushed talc- or magnesium silicate-containing tablets such as methylphenidate causes perivascular deposition leading to chronic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It is linked to pulmonary hypertension and emphysema, particularly in the lower lobes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, our patient displayed no drug use behaviors.\n\n【13】Occupational exposure to fumes and chemicals is well known to cause a large spectrum of lung disease. Chronic exposure to diacetyl, a volatile organic compound that is used as flavoring chemical, causes airway epithelial injury which leads to bronchiolitis obliterans, called “popcorn lung” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Bronchiolitis obliterans causes fibrosis due to excessive granulation tissue affecting the small conducting airways and can mimic COPD on imaging but often results in a restrictive or mixed restrictive/obstructive pattern on pulmonary function testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. “Popcorn lung” was considered given her occupational history; however, her PFTs were not consistent with the restrictive disease.\n\n【14】Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome is a rare entity associated with postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans, typically during childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The characteristic radiological pattern is hypoplasia/hypogenesis of the pulmonary arteries with hypoperfusion, giving a translucency to unilateral lung. It is associated with recurrent pulmonary infections during childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The patient in our case underwent CTA of the chest which did not reveal any hypogenesis of the pulmonary arteries. Furthermore, she denied recurrent childhood respiratory infections.\n\n【15】Cigarette smoking remains the most important risk factor for developing emphysema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Smoking-related emphysema is typically upper lobe predominant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, although lower lobe predominant emphysema can be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This patient’s significant smoking history and negative workup for other causes made smoking-related emphysema most likely.\n\n【16】This patient had Stage IV COPD with frequent exacerbations despite maximum medical therapy. The bibasilar manifestation of emphysema is most likely smoking-related. Smoking-related emphysema is typically upper lobe predominant, and bibasilar manifestation is relatively uncommon. She was offered lung volume reduction at our lung center, with clinical improvement in her symptoms and functional status. Although LVRS is the current gold standard treatment of hyperinflation in COPD with mortality and symptomatic benefits, it also confers an increased risk of perioperative morbidity. These benefits are most obvious in patients with upper lobe predominant disease and poor functional status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. On the contrary, patients with nonupper lobe predominant emphysema are likely poor candidates for LVRS. BLVR is a minimally invasive technique for lung volume reduction using either endobronchial valves or coils. It has been shown to offer improvement in exercise tolerance and lung function for patients who do not qualify for LVRS or are poor surgical candidates. Similar to LVRS, greater benefits are seen in patients with upper lobe predominant emphysema. To date, no large studies have shown improved survival with BLVR, but it still remains an option for patients with severe COPD for symptomatic management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】While lower lobe emphysema is commonly attributed to AATD, the differential diagnosis is broad and often distinct from its upper lobe counterpart. Careful history taking is essential for any patients diagnosed with lower lobe emphysema to elucidate the underlying etiology.\n\n【19】#### Abbreviations\n\n| COPD: | Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |\n| --- | --- |\n| AATD: | Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency |\n| AAT: | Alpha-1-antitrypsin |\n| OSA: | Obstructive sleep apnea |\n| FEV1: | Forced expiratory volume per 1 second |\n| FCV: | Forced vital capacity |\n| TLC: | Total lung capacity |\n| RV: | Residual volume |\n| DLCO: | Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide |\n| LVRS: | Lung volume reduction surgery |\n| BLVR: | Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

However, there are no reports on the complications of date seeds after oral consumption. We currently report a patient with no history of gastrointestinal disease, who has been admitted to the hospital with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and suffered from complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The term PVT refers to the complete or partial obstruction of blood flow in the portal vein, due to the presence of thrombus in the vassal lumen, which occurs rarely in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There are numerous factors that can contribute to this disorder, including chronic liver disease, malignancies, processes localized to the epigastrium and hepatobiliary system, and acquired as well as inherited thrombophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Acute and chronic PVT has different clinical manifestations. Acute PVT is associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, lactacidosis, sepsis, and intestinal congestion with ischemia. In contrast, chronic PVT can be completely asymptomatic, or characterized by splenomegaly, pancytopenia, varicose veins, and rarely ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Previous studies have shown that some plant products and herbal remedies can cause serious toxic effects and drug interactions that have not been scientifically evaluated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) rich in valuable nutrients grows in arid and semiarid regions of the world, especially in most Middle-Eastern countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Date seed is the byproduct of date stoning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, which is a hard coated seed, usually oblong, ventrally grooved, with a small embryo and weight of 0.5 g to 4 g 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6,7\\]</u>. A study conducted in Iran has shown that the date seeds on an average contain 4.84% protein, 12.22% fat, 27.58% fiber, 80.76% carbohydrates, 1.18% ash, and 1.72% moisture. The date seeds are also a rich source of phenolics and minerals, including iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), sodium (Na), zinc (Zn), and magnesium (Mg). The main fatty acids of the seed oil are oleic, lauric, palmitic, myristic, linoleic, and stearic acids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Date seeds are also used for therapeutic purposes in some places 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Date seeds are used in the caffeine-free drinks in Arab countries, where such a powder is assumed to prevent gastric upset and indigestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In addition, date seeds have been used in Egyptian folk medicine without scientific evidence for many years to manage liver diseases, diabetes, and gastrointestinal disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the present case study, we report an interesting case, in which PVT has developed after oral consumption of a large amount of date seeds powder. Early diagnosis, proper management, and identification of causal agents may affect the patient’s outcome and mortality.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】An 82-year-old man (height: 170 cm; weight: 62 kg; BMI: 21.4) with a history of diabetes mellitus referred to the hospital because of a generalized abdominal pain with predominance of epigastric pain radiating to the back and an intensity of 8 out of 10 began 4 days ago. He had experienced severe anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distention for 3 days before hospital admission. He was using metformin 500 mg twice a day to control his blood sugar. He had no history of cardiac and liver diseases. He had no problems until 4 days before hospital admission. He had no history of drug or alcohol use and without a thromboembolic disease history, but he had been eating date seeds powder (two tablespoons twice a day) for two weeks to relieve chronic knee joint pain without physician prescription. Absence of bowel sound and generalized tenderness with severe epigastric pain were found on the physical examination. The entire abdomen percussion showed a dull sound, and shifting dullness test was positive for ascites.\n\n【7】His body temperature, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure were 36.9°C, 93%, 102 beats a minute, and 111/61 mmHg, respectively. The complete blood count showed the following parameters: white blood cells (WBCs) count 11.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, red blood cell (RBC) count 4.25 mcL, hemoglobin concentration (Hb) 12.2 g/L, hematocrit (Hct) 34.4%, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 35 sec, prothrombin time (PT) 13 sec, international normalized ratio (INR) 1, bleeding time (BT) 5 minutes, clotting time (CT) 11 minutes, blood urea nitrogen 95 mg/dl, and creatinine 1.5 μmol/L. In addition, the patient test results of factor V Leiden (FAK-tur five LIDE-n) and lupus anticoagulants (LA) were negative.\n\n【8】Furthermore, the patient’s liver function tests showed alanine transaminase (ALT), 26 IU/L; aspartate transaminase (AST), 17 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 175 IU/L; serum total protein, 5.3 g/dl; serum albumin, 3.1 g/dl; blood sugar, 214 mg/dl; and amylase, 33 IU/L. Ascites fluid sample analysis showed negative culture; albumin, 0.9 g/dl; protein, 1.8 g/dl; WBC, 90 (90% lymph)/mm<sup>3</sup>; RBC, 380/mm<sup>3</sup>; and sugar, 199 mg/dl. Plane abdominal series radiographies and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvic were carried out. The radiographic findings corresponded with the ileus of the small bowel . Abdominal CT scan showed portal vein thrombosis with small bowel disseminated edema and ileus .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The patient’s chest X-ray: (a) no significant finding in chest X-ray; (b) colon is visible; (c) dilated small bowel loops.</u>\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 The patient’s CT: (a) ascites in chest CT; (b) portal vein thrombosis in abdominal CT; (c) extension of thrombosis in the superior mesenteric vein in abdominal CT; (d) edematous small bowel wall in abdominal CT.</u>\n\n【11】For exclusion of any other possible diagnosis, like mesenteric venous ischemia, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. There was edematous small bowel and dilated colon with no ischemia and pathologic finding in the abdomen and pelvis but the massive ascites. The liver was normal in appearance, and biopsies were taken. Pathological reports of omentum and peritoneum and liver biopsies were normal. Our case study did not have the PVT risk factors, including chronic liver disease, malignancies, processes localized to the epigastrium and hepatobiliary system, and acquired as well as inherited thrombophilia.\n\n【12】In the thorough retrospective survey, we found no other probable reason or specific issue except consumption of date seeds powder. He was treated with conservative management, anticoagulant drugs, and continuous unfractionated heparin 18 U/Kg/h. He got better gradually. Bowel sound was present on the third postoperative day with bisacodyl suppository and lactulose syrup. Hepatic encephalopathy occurred on the 10<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, and the patient became confused but got better after an increase in lactulose dosage and administration of rifaximin 550 mg twice a day. He felt better over time, and his confusion disappeared completely on the 20<sup>th</sup> day. He never became icteric. Finally, he was discharged from hospital 25 days later with rivaroxaban 20 mg/day and came back to his normal life within a month. Rivaroxaban treatment was ceased after 3 months. He is well and has normal function by now.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Studies have reported allergy or hypersensitivity to date palm fruit and pollen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>, and date palm fruit is considered as a strong allergen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. There are also some concerns about date varieties with high concentration of selenium, which is related to the amount of selenium in the soil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has reported the adverse effects of date seeds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. We report the first case of PVT after consumption of the date seeds for a long time.\n\n【15】PVT is a vascular disease of the liver that occurs when a blood clot occurs in the hepatic portal vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. PVT was often considered idiopathic in the past, but now PVT can be diagnosed in about 70% of the cases because of prothrombotic abnormalities and a better perception of susceptible clinical conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. PVT is commonly associated with cirrhosis, abdominal malignancies, and localized inflammation, infection, and prothrombotic disorders. Acute or chronic PVT is often difficult to diagnose. There are major challenges to PVT management strategies, including anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and surgical options. Early diagnosis and proper management have important effects on the rate of mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【16】One of the genetic factors that causes PVT is thrombophilia. The factor V G1691A mutation and the prothrombin G20210A mutation are the two most common genetic causes of thrombophilia. However, the effects of these two gene mutations along with other risk factors can increase the occurrence of venous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The JAK2V617F mutation has been described in 17% of the patients with portal and mesenteric venous thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Prevalence of the JAK2V617F mutation was 1.4% in cirrhotic patients with PVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Routine screening for the JAK2V617F mutation can be recommended in nonmalignant and noncirrhotic patients with PVT, but not in cirrhotic patients with PVT. The splenomegaly might be closely associated with the JAK2V617F mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The prevalence of calreticulin (CALR) mutations in splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) varies among studies. Li et al. have shown that the pooled proportion of CALR mutations was 1.59% in PVT patients and 1.82% in PVT patients without JAK2V617F mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Based on a meta-analysis by Qi et al. the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation is associated with an increased risk of PVT among patients with/without cirrhosis. In addition, the prothrombin G20210A mutation is associated with PVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Examination of the case study showed that the 82-year-old patient had no history of genetic disease or even previous hospitalization. Owing to the fact that genetic diseases and alterations and their complications are appeared at an early age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>, the possibility of genetic problems in this patient is unlikely. One of our limitations was that the some of the mentioned tests were not checked in our center; however, according to the patient’s negative results of FVL and LA tests, further laboratory tests are not strongly recommended. There is also no Virchow’s triad, and examination of the patient’s CT findings showed that the patient’s splenic vein was open and there was no venous anatomical abnormality. There was no evidence of Budd–Chiari syndrome. Therefore, the specialized team did not consider necessary to perform V G1691A, G20210A, and JAK2V617F tests.\n\n【18】Review of literature did not show any side effects of date seeds. Date seeds powder was used as an herbal medicine in the past to treat diseases such as progeria, anemia, and impotency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. Date seeds could be a promising candidate for protection against the CCl4-induced liver intoxication, and this hepatoprotective effect may be attributed to the antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities of some components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Studies have shown that date palm seed consumption has anti-inflammatory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> and antioxidant properties in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【19】El et al. have shown that date seed extract is safe for the liver and kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Therefore, middle-aged women can use it regularly to maintain good health, improve the immune system, and prevent chronic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Clinical implications obtained from the study of Isworo 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u> suggest that physicians may offer palm seed powder as a functional beverage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Alem et al. showed that date seeds could increase the nutritional value of some foods used for human consumption and they could be used as additives in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Some other studies have suggested the possible applications of date seed oil for cosmetics, pharmaceutics, and related products and have less considered the date palm seed for food products 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Date seed powder was characterized by low moisture and high carbohydrate and fat contents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Studies have shown that date seeds can be used as a probiotic and interact with the intestinal microflora, especially probiotic bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. The results of Darwish et al. have shown that date powder caused the growth of probiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. On the other hand, the results of Zhu et al. showed an unrecognized mechanistic link between specific dietary nutrients, gut microbes, platelet function, and the risk of thrombosis. Gut microbes can directly contribute to platelet hyperactivity and enhance the thrombotic potential by producing trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【21】We hypothesize that date seed powder may interact with gut microbiota and cause various reactions producing TMAO and possibly leading to thrombosis. There are complex interactions between diet composition, the gut microbiota, and their metabolites that affect human health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Well-designed clinical trials and further experimental studies are required to determine the influence of probiotics such as date powder on TMAO. Further studies are required due to the lack of evidence, as the review of literature shows insufficient scientific evidence to document and ascertain the (adverse) effects and complications of date seed accurately. Our case report has hypothesized that date seeds can have side effects; however, clinical trials are required to confirm this claim. In addition, most studies have dealt with the health benefits of date seed consumption and have not considered its possible side effects.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】Since date seeds are used in some places for human consumption and disease treatment, it is necessary to pay attention to the side effects and problems associated with their consumption. In geographical areas where date seeds are ingested, health professionals should pay attention to the side effects of date seed, inform consumers, and prevent its complications. The present study can provide valuable and new insights for future studies to better understand and identify the adverse effects and reactions due to date seed intake.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Although eosinophilia is commonly seen in rheumatological conditions such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and less commonly in dermatomyositis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, progressive systemic sclerosis, and Sjögren syndrome, it has been rarely described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Here, we present a case of 17-year male who presented to our center with multisystem involvement and was diagnosed to have eosinophilic vasculitis with SLE.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 17-year-male presented to our center with multiple skin lesions on bilateral lower limbs for 7 months. It started as painless, clear fluid-filled vesicles which later drained pus and resolved spontaneously. One month before the hospital presentation, he had 10–14 episodes of small-volume loose stool with mucus which lasted for 14 days. The diarrhea was not associated with fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Subsequently, he developed sharp, nonradiating pain at the tip of the left 2nd toe which progressed to dry gangrene involving half of the phalanx. He also complained of bilateral lower limb swelling and facial puffiness which subsided by the evening. He also had a productive cough with streaky hemoptysis without chest pain and shortness of breath. He also complained of fatigue, anorexia, and significant weight loss. There was no history of excessive hair fall, ear discharge, joint pain, malar rash, photosensitivity, oral and nasal ulcers, lumps and swelling, and muscle weakness. Patient did not have any comorbidities and has no history of any drug intake. A comprehensive timeline of his symptoms is shown in Figure 1.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Timeline of symptoms onset.</u>\n\n【7】On examination, pallor was present. Bilateral dorsalis pedis and left posterior tibial artery pulse were not palpable. Dry gangrene in the left second toe with a sharp line of demarcation was evident . Patchy loss of hair over bilateral toes was seen. Multiple skin lesions with central hypopigmentation and perilesional hyperpigmentation were seen on the bilateral lower limbs . There was diminished movement on the left side of the chest with a woody dull note on percussion and decreased vesicular breath sound.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Dry gangrene in the left second toe.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Multiple skin lesions with central hypopigmentation and perilesional hyperpigmentation.</u>\n\n【10】The hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin of 9.1 gm/dl) and eosinophilia (a total leucocyte count of 28560/mm<sup>3</sup> with 36% eosinophils and an absolute eosinophil count of 10288/mm<sup>3</sup>). Inflammatory markers were raised (ESR 73 mm/hour and high sensitivity C-reactive protein 10680 ng/ml). His activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 37.7 s (control 29 s). On urinalysis, proteinuria was 1+ with a dipstick without active sediments, and 24-hour urine protein (UP) was 3.17 g/day. Peripheral blood smear showed increased corrected retics count and lactate dehydrogenase along with positive direct Coomb’s test .\n\n【11】Table 1 Laboratory findings of the patient.\n\n【12】Antinuclear antibody (ANA) tested positive with a homogeneous pattern and intensity of 3+ on immunofluorescence; however, his ANA immunoblot was negative. His dsDNA was raised, and antiphospholipid syndrome workup showed a borderline raised level of lupus anticoagulants and normal titres of anticardiolipin and anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibody. His C3 and C4 levels were normal .\n\n【13】Table 2 Serum antibody testing and its results of the patient.\n\n【14】Contrast-enhanced computed axial tomography scan (CECT) of the chest and pulmonary angiography was done that revealed multiple intermediate-walled cavitary lesions in the bilateral lower lobes. A biopsy from the left lower lobe was done which revealed necrotic tissue. Other laboratory results did not show any signs of renal, electrolyte, or hepatic abnormalities. The Mantoux test and sputum for acid-fast bacilli yielded negative results. Tests for hepatitis A, B, and C, HIV1 and 2, and leptospirosis were negative. Repeated examination of blood, urine, sputum, and stool for bacterial and parasitic infection revealed no abnormalities. The stool revealed no RBC, parasite, egg, ova, or cyst.\n\n【15】He was started on high-dose oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg), mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, and anticoagulation. One week after the commencement of immunosuppressive therapy, 24-hour UP decreased to 0.29 g/day, and his hemogram revealed a decrease in eosinophil count to 13%. Three months later, on follow-up, the patient was symptom-free, and his absolute eosinophil count and 24-hour UP normalized to normal range.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disorder with varying involvement of different organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【18】In our case, there was the involvement of the vascular, hematological, respiratory, and renal systems. The investigation confirmed the diagnosis of SLE and persistent hypereosinophilia. Additional laboratory investigation was warranted to determine the cause of eosinophilia which included peripheral blood smear (for hematological malignancies), serological tests for hepatitis A, B, and C, HIV1 and 2, leptospirosis, blood, stool, and urine examination and culture. None of the tests were conclusive. There was no evidence for tuberculosis and aspergillosis as X-ray, CT scan, Mantoux test, and sputum for acid-fast bacilli yielded equivocal results. There was no evidence of parasitic infections. We planned to perform a tissue biopsy of the skin lesion and renal biopsy but could not be done as the biopsy specimen had to be sent to another country (for immunofluorescence), and it was unfeasible amidst COVID-19 nation-wide lockdown.\n\n【19】This manuscript not only points the unusual presentation of SLE with eosinophilia but also its presentation in a young male. SLE is more prevalent in female of child bearing age; however, it has various manifestations which vary according to the age group and gender because of difference in their pathogenetic mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Based on the history, clinical examination, and serum antibody positive for ANA, dsDNA, and lupus anticoagulant, we made a diagnosis of eosinophilic vasculitis with SLE with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAs). He can be diagnosed to have SLE on the basis of 2012 SLICC criteria as well as 2019 EULAR/ACR criterion. Positive ANA along with proteinuria >0.5 g/day with positive lupus anticoagulant and anti-ds DNA gives ≥10 with at least one clinical criterion point the diagnosis of SLE according to 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria for SLE. The diagnosis was further supported by a marked response to corticosteroid and MMF therapy. The main limitation and diagnostic challenge in our diagnosis was the unavailability of histopathological study of tissue biopsy of the skin lesions which would have guided our diagnosis of eosinophilic vasculitis earlier.\n\n【20】The other differential diagnoses to this presentation of this condition are parasitic infection, drug-induced lupus, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In this patient, serological tests and stool examination were carried out to exclude the presence of parasites, and no clinical signs of parasitic infection were present. Stool and serological tests were also negative for parasitic infection. The absence of intake of any drugs and negative antihistone antibody ruled out the possibility of drug-induced lupus. Although eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a possible diagnosis for this patient, negative P-ANCA and fulfilment of EULAR criteria make the diagnosis of SLE more favorable than eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\n\n【21】Increased serum LDH along with increased retics count in peripheral blood smear along with positive direct Coomb’s test points that the cause of anemia in this case be autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The discordance between the proteinuria and anemia shall be nothing more than a mere coincidence. The presence of AIHA further adds to the positive correlation of this case to SLE.\n\n【22】Eosinophilia in the absence of coexisting allergy or parasitic infection is rarely seen in SLE patients. Eosinophilia with multiple organ/system involvement suggests eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss vasculitis) as the primary working diagnosis. In the evaluation of such patients, it is recommended to test for toxocariasis, Aspergillus species (to evaluate for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis), and human immunodeficiency virus. The laboratory investigations should include vitamin B12 level (to evaluate for myeloproliferative hypereosinophilic syndrome), peripheral blood smear (to look for dysplastic eosinophils or blasts suggestive of primary eosinophilic bone marrow process), and chest computed tomography scan (to evaluate for lung involvement) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Several reports have described eosinophilic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, eosinophilic gastroenteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>, Loffler’s endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>, eosinophilic pruritic cutaneous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, and nonerosive arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. All of the cases possessed diagnostic difficulty due to the rarity of the case.

In another case report by Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, who used low-dose prednisolone (10–30 mg/day) for hypereosinophilic syndrome with SLE, there was no improvement in cutaneous manifestations. However, proteinuria in the patient had resolved. All the history, clinical, diagnosis, treatment, and result after treatment in reported cases of SLE with eosinophilia affecting different organs are given in Table 3.\n\n【24】Table 3 Clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of different reported studies.\n\n【25】This case report points to an atypical presentation of SLE with eosinophilia thus adding to the existing literature. The main limitation to this study is failure to obtain the skin and kidney biopsies, which could have confirmed the diagnosis in this patient. Due to the existing condition of worldwide pandemic, biopsy could not be done. However, the above discussed features support the diagnosis of SLE in this patient with atypical feature like eosinophilia.\n\n【26】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【27】We here present a rare association of SLE with eosinophilia. SLE should be kept in the differential diagnosis of persistent unexplained eosinophilia.

Little is known about the effects of volume change by hemodialysis (HD) and mechanical stress caused by an anatomical structure being in contact with the left atrium on the progression of atrial remodeling. We experienced a case of atrial tachycardia (AT) in a patient who had left atrial (LA) scarring at the LA roof and a low-voltage area with slow conduction around the LA scar as components of AT circuit. Here, we present the conceivable hypothesis of the LA scar and the low-voltage area formation. Our concept can be useful in developing a strategy for ablation in a patient with chronic renal failure (CRF) on HD. Case Report. A 65-year-old man with CRF on HD was referred for AT ablation. Three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping revealed that the AT conducted around an LA scar in a counterclockwise fashion. There was a slow conduction area at the superior side of the LA scar, where the AT was terminated during the ablation. Computed tomography indicated a close relationship between the LA and the anatomical structures (ascending aorta and pulmonary artery). Conclusion. Volume change by HD and close contact of anatomical structures to the LA can promote atrial remodeling, resulting in AT occurrence.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】It is well known that diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic renal failure (CRF) promote the remodeling of atrial muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In contrast, there are limited data on how mechanical stress due to hemodialysis (HD) influences atrial remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We experienced a case of atrial tachycardia (AT) circulating around a left atrial (LA) roof scar in a DM and CRF patient on HD. Echocardiography showed a remarkable change in LA diameter before and after HD. Three-dimensional (3D) electroanatomical mapping merged with computed tomography revealed that the LA scar was close to the pulmonary artery (PA), and the low-voltage area was close to the ascending aorta (AS-Ao). In the current case report, we present a hypothesis that short-term volume change by HD and mechanical stress by PA and AS-Ao can induce atrial remodeling, resulting in the formation of an AT circuit.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 65-year-old man was referred to our hospital for ablation of the AT. He had been treated for end-stage renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate: 9 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; serum sodium level: 139 mEq/L; serum potassium level: 3.6 mEq/L) due to DM and was receiving HD treatment. He felt palpitations and was diagnosed as having AT with a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Pilsicainide and amiodarone were prescribed; however neither medication could suppress the AT. Ablation was therefore considered. The patient’s blood pressure (BP) was within normal range and his DM was well controlled (BP 110/70 mmHg and HbA1c 6.1%). Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction: 56.5%) without LV dilatation (LV end-diastolic diameter: 52 mm). The LA was dilated (50 mm) prior to HD. The ECG recorded on admission showed AT with 290 ms PP intervals. P wave morphology was bimodal, positive, and wide in leads I, II, III, and and positive/negative in lead V1 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. The sinus rhythm ECG showed a different P wave morphology; lead I was flat, leads II, III, and were positive, and lead V1 was positive/negative 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>. An electrophysiological study was performed with a twenty-polar electrode catheter (Halo catheter) positioned along the tricuspid annulus (TA) and two octapolar electrode catheters positioned in the coronary sinus (CS) and at the bundle of His. The earliest local activity was recorded at the CS ostium at this time 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. The total interval of atrial activity including TA, CS, and His electrodes did not fulfill the clinical AT cycle length (CL). We therefore advanced a mapping catheter into the distal CS, where a fragmented long duration potential was observed. After a transseptal puncture, 3D electroanatomical mapping of the LA was constructed using the CARTO system. In the LA voltage map, there was a scar area at the LA anterior roof. Around the scar, there were low-voltage areas with fragmentation at the roof and right anterior wall of the LA 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. The activation map fulfilled almost the entire duration of the AT CL. This result indicated that the AT circulated around the scar in a counterclockwise fashion 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Entrainment pacing was performed at the LA roof (black circle in Figure 2(a)), where a fragmented potential was recorded 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. The postpacing interval was in accordance with the AT CL 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. Therefore, linear ablation was performed between the roof scar and the ostium of the right upper pulmonary vein 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>, during which the AT was finally terminated 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b))</u>. After completion of the ablation line, the AT could not be induced. Six months after ablation, no AT recurrence was observed.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 (a) The left panel shows a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in sinus rhythm (SR) and the right panel shows that of atrial tachycardia (AT).

Discussion\n\n【10】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of AT conducted around the scar at the LA anterior roof in a patient with DM on HD. There are two interesting points of observation; the first is the relationship between the P wave morphology of the AT and the conducting manner to the RA and LA. The second noteworthy observation is the anticipated mechanism of the scar and low-voltage area formation in the LA in a CRF patient on HD who had no structural heart disease or no history of AF.\n\n【11】The P wave morphology of the AT in the present case was positive and bimodal in leads I, II, III, and and positive/negative in lead V1. As shown in Figure 2(b), there were slow conduction areas in the right and the superior sides of the LA scar. The wavefront went down to the right side of the scar and turned left below the scar through the slow conduction area. This propagation manner constituted the first positive component of the P wave in leads I, II, III, and . Interestingly, the AT wavefront propagated from the LA to the RA through the mid to inferior part of the septum only 删除1:<u>(Figure 4(a))</u>, probably because of the Bachman bundle conduction disorder, which was generated by the existence of the anterior roof scar in the LA. The scar might have caused severe damage to the conductivity of the Bachman bundle. Hence, the wavefront, which propagated to the RA, went up the septum of the RA and turned around the TA in a counterclockwise manner, as shown in Figure 3(a). This is composed of the second positive component in leads I, II, III, and with a short duration of 50 msec. The duration of the P wave was about 190 msec and the residual duration of the AT CL was given by the slow conduction area located at the superior side of the LA scar 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. The positive/negative P wave in lead V1 was explained by the spreading manner of the AT, which propagated from the mid to inferior septum of the LA to RA. This propagation style was similar to that of the AT originating from the aortic sinus of Valsalva. Wang et al. reported that the P wave morphology of AT originating from the noncoronary cusp and left coronary cusp is positive/negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 (a) The propagation map of AT with the LA, right atrium (RA), and CS. Arabic numbers indicate the time course of AT. The wavefront conducts around the LA scar with no excitation of the RA (images 1–3). The mid to inferior part of the RA began to activate (image 4). The RA wavefront went up to the RA septum and turned around the TA in a counterclockwise manner (images 5 and 6). The orange arrowhead indicates the AT wavefront. (b) The anatomical relationship between the LA low-voltage area and the ascending aorta, as well as between the LA scar and the pulmonary artery presented with the 3D electroanatomical map of the LA merged with computed tomography. As indicated by the red line, the LA scar was represented by grey area and the low-voltage areas were represented by red, yellow, and green areas.</u>\n\n【13】Although it is well known that HD strongly promotes exacerbation of atherosclerosis, to the best of our knowledge, it is still unclear how LA remodeling progresses in patients with CRF on HD. Hori et al. reported that the contact areas, where the LA wall is anatomically in contact with the vertebrae, AS-Ao, or descending aorta (DS-Ao), are strongly associated with low-voltage areas and fractionated potentials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Anatomical structures, such as the sinus of Valsalva, AS-Ao, DS-Ao, and the vertebrae, might put direct pressure on the LA and possibly extend the low-voltage area and the fragmentation potential formation, resulting in LA remodeling. In the present case, as shown in Figure 2(a), there was a scar area on the anterior superior of the LA. Low-voltage areas were found around the scar, specifically at the superior side (LA roof) and the right side of the scar (close to the RSPV). Notably, the scar region was located where a PA located in front of the scar with a short relative distance 删除1:<u>(Figure 4(b))</u>. In addition, the low-voltage areas were very close to the sinus of Valsalva and the AS-Ao. Tekce et al. reported that even a single session of dialysis changed the LA diameter from  mm (before HD) to  mm (after HD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This result means that the stretching of the atrial myocytes occurred each time HD was performed, and the stretch itself has been proven to promote the LA remodeling. In the present case, the LA diameter measured by echocardiography also changed from 50.0 mm before HD to 45.7 mm after HD. Moreover, a dilated LA before HD might be considered to be closer to the PA and AS-Ao than that after HD. These areas of the LA were not only stretched by inner pressure before HD, but also compressed by anatomical structures (PA and AS-Ao). Such stretching and compression forces might injure the atrial myocytes and consequently induce a low-voltage area or scar formation in the LA.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】LA volume changes caused by HD can create stretching forces in the atrium. The anatomical structure around the LA can provide the atrial myocytes with the compression force. Such mechanical stress might promote the LA remodeling, resulting in scarring or a low-voltage area, as well as a slow conduction area, formation in the absence of AF. This concept could help us develop a strategy for catheter ablation in CRF patients on HD in a more effective manner.\n\n【16】#### Competing Interests\n\n【17】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Hereditary AT deficiency is frequently caused by mutations in SERPINC1 gene. It is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Homozygous pathogenic mutations in this gene are extremely rare. We present a case of a 7-year-old female who presented at age of 4 years with massive cerebral sinus venous thrombosis. Thrombophilia workup showed a low AT level of 30%. Targeted genetic sequencing of SERPINC1 revealed a novel pathogenic homozygous mutation c.1320C>G p. (Phe440Leu). The patient was managed initially with unfractionated heparin with AT replacement using fresh frozen plasma and was later switched to only low-molecular-weight heparin. There was no recurrence or new thrombosis with 3 years of follow-up.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Antithrombin (antithrombin III, AT) deficiency is a thrombophilia disorder. AT is a significant plasmatic inhibitor for activated coagulation factors such as thrombin (factor IIa), factor Xa, and factor IXa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. AT protein is encoded by the SERPINC1 (serpin family C member 1) gene. SERPINC1 is located on chromosome 1q25.1 and contains seven exons and six introns. The structure of SERPINC1 gene and protein is shown in Figure 1. Hereditary AT deficiency is usually caused by single-point mutations in SERPINC1. It is associated with an about 20-fold increase in the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Several mutations and genetic alterations have been recognized in this gene which is relatively rare (1 in 2000–3000 individuals) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. According to ClinVar on the NIH website 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, there are 300 different SERPINC1 mutations causing AT deficiency. Most of the mutations that have been described in the SERPINC1 are heterozygous, which are inherited as autosomal dominant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Homozygosity is extremely rare and may not be compatible with life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, a few patients who harbour homozygous mutations were reported and had severe thromboembolic events early in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In most AT deficiency, patients showed a decrease in AT plasmatic level to less than 50% (normal range, 80–120%).\n\n【4】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The SERPINC1 gene and protein domain structures. The figure showed gene ID 462 SERPINC1 as well as merged features of NP\\000479.1 and NM\\000488.3 with 1357 kb. The SERPINC1 gene shown by a heavy horizontal arrow line represents genomic DNA. Exons are shown as vertical green bars and numbered from 1 to 7. The amino acids encoded by each exon are indicated below the vertical green bars and are numbered from 1 to 464. The SERPINC1 protein structure showed two main domains: the NH<sub>2</sub>\\-terminal heparin-binding domain encoded by exon 2 and a COOH-terminal thrombin- (serine protease-) binding domain. The patient point mutation is indicated by red colour in the dotted box at exon 7 (c.1320C>G); also, the result of this mutation is indicated on 440 a.a which leads to produced Leu (leucine) instead of Phe (phenylalanine) (adapted from 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>).</u>\n\n【5】There are two types of AT deficiency: quantitative (type I) and qualitative (type II). Quantitative (type I) AT deficiency occurs when the AT level is reduced, and the antigen/anticoagulant activity ratio is close to one. Patients with qualitative (type II) AT deficiency have normal antigen levels; however, the antigen/anticoagulant activity ratio is higher than one, indicating that a variant AT with impaired or null anticoagulant activity is present in plasma. Type II AT deficiency can be classified into three subtypes according to the AT functional defect, which is frequently associated with the location of the pathogenic mutation: IIa in the reactive site (RS), IIb in the heparin-binding site (HBS), and IIc in pleiotropic (PE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【6】In this case, we report a 7-year-old child with a novel homozygous detrimental mutation in SERPINC1 who presented at the age of 4 years with severe cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present the case of a 7-year-old female who presented at the age of 4 years with a history of fever, frequent vomiting, headache, and neck pain. The past medical history is remarkable for two episodes of simple febrile seizures at 2 and 3 years of age. The initial physical assessment showed that the patient was drowsy, had stiff neck, had a Glasgow coma scale of 12/15, and had a normal otherwise neurological assessment. The initial impression was of meningoencephalitis, which was managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The septic workup was negative. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR angiography (MRA), and MR venography (MRV) showed an extensive dural sinus and cerebral venous thrombosis with secondary sequela of bilateral thalamic and basal ganglia venous congestion and venous infarcts. The patient was started on unfractionated heparin. Antiphospholipid antibody screening was negative. Initial thrombophilia workup was remarkable for AT level of 14% (normal range, 80–120%). Thus, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) infusion was added to anticoagulation to replace AT. The patient was subsequently switched to enoxaparin with regular FFP infusions in the first year of therapy. The FFP was discontinued, and the patient was continued on enoxaparin with an anti-Xa level ranging between 0.2 and 0.4 IU/mL over the last two years, with no evidence of new or recurrent thrombosis. Oral anticoagulant was not given based on parental preference. AT level ranges now between 25 and 35%.\n\n【9】SERPINC1 gene sequencing targeted the following: the coding regions, 10 bp of flanking introns, and any previously described pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. This also included copy number variation analysis. DNA sequencing of SERPINC1 gene revealed a novel homozygous variant NM\\000488.3: c.1320C>G p. (Phe440Leu), which was not reported in Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), and 1000 Genomes Project (1000G). AT level was 56% in the father and 50% in the mother, and the older sister had AT level of 61%. The mother had a history of deep vein thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Homozygosity of SERPINC1 mutation in our patient was associated with type I AT deficiency. The patient presented with thrombosis at the age of 4 years, which was triggered by infection and dehydration. Most of the previously reported autosomal recessive AT deficiency cases developed severe arterial or venous thrombosis early in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The prevalence of inherited bleeding disorders varies from one population to another due to genetic differences and ethnicity. Little is known about bleeding disorder prevalence in the Saudi population. However, a study by Al Saleh et al. showed that the Saudi population has a higher prevalence of coagulation factor deficiency than the western population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Fewer data are available about AT deficiency in children due to the rarity of the disorder. Thus, the purpose of this report is to increase physician awareness about this rare severe illness.\n\n【13】The molecular genetic basis of AT deficiency has been extensively examined. AT deficiency is caused by 300 distinct SERPINC1 mutations according to ClinVar NIH website 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. To minimize this number, we only choose the pathogenic clinically significant and single nucleotide variant type. This gave us 34 clinical variants out of the 300 variants shown in Table 1 in the supplementary. The variant we presented in this article was not reported before. To understand this variant effect in our patient, we locate SERPINC1 point mutation on the gene structure, and c.1320C>G is in exon 7 in the C-terminal region of SERPINC1 protein, as shown in Figure 1. The SERPINC1 protein structure showed two main domains: the NH<sub>2</sub>\\-terminal heparin-binding domain encoded by exon 2 and a COOH-terminal thrombin- (serine protease-) binding domain encoded by exon 7. Exon 7 is transcribed to mRNA and then translated to amino acid numbers from 407 to 464, which contain the thrombin-binding domain. As the point mutation in our patient is located in exon 7, this mutation may affect the thrombin-binding activity on SERPINC1 protein which led to thrombosis in this case.\n\n【14】There are no clear guidelines on the optimal duration of anticoagulation in patients with homozygous AT deficiency. Long-term anticoagulation was continued in our patient because of concerns about the high risk of the development of new thrombosis which has been reported in cases before 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The optimal choice of anticoagulants (low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, or direct oral anticoagulant) in AT deficiency still needs to be defined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【16】Homozygous in SERPINC1 gene is a rare condition that could cause severe thrombosis. Therefore, patients with homozygous AT deficiency should continue using anticoagulation for life due to the increased risk of thrombus recurrence assumed from previous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However, the optimal choice of anticoagulants such as using low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, or direct oral anticoagulants in AT deficiency still needs to be defined.

The defect was filled with a pedicled buccal fat pad flap. The mesenchymal origin from the dental follicle of the fibromyxoma is the most plausible explanation. Radiological examination with MRI, CT, and conventional radiography contributes to the differential diagnosis from other benign tumors, such as the ameloblastoma. Its management is surgical and comprises enucleation and curettage or en bloc resection. Patients must be monitored for at least two years postoperatively in order to diagnose possible recurrence.

Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 46-year-old male was referred to the outpatient department of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic of the General Hospital “G. Papanikolaou” of Thessaloniki, with a swelling of the right maxilla. The swelling occurred 8 months prior to the consultation. Facial and mucosal numbness, pain, or tooth mobility was absent.\n\n【7】The medical anamnesis of the patient did not reveal anything in relation to the pathological condition. Radiological investigation by means of a panoramic radiograph was not helpful in diagnosing the lesion. Waters’ view revealed complete obstruction of the right maxillary sinus. A Computed Tomography (CT) imaging of the maxilla revealed a large radiolucent lesion extending from the area of the right canine to the area mesial to the first molar. Examination with Computed Tomography (CT) Scan showed expansion of the walls of the right maxillary sinus, obstruction with low density tissue of the whole cavity, and local erosion of the walls . The intravenous administration of contrast agent showed no enhancement of the lesion. Involvement of the floor of the left maxillary sinus, partial obstruction of the ethmoid sinus, and slight thickening of the mucosa of the left frontal sinus are indicative of a secondary sinusitis. The nasopharynx and lateral pharyngeal spaces were normal.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Axial Computed Tomography (CT) reveals expansion of the walls of the right maxillary sinus, obstruction with low density tissue of the whole cavity, and local erosion of the walls. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】The lesion was approached by means of a lateral rhinotomy incision, with enucleation and curettage of the tumor.\n\n【10】The lesion had a solid consistency and was totally resected .

Search terms included ≪fibromyxoma≫ and ≪myxoma≫. Exclusion criteria were not relevant papers, interviews, books’ and conferences’ abstracts, comments, replies to author and to editor, and unsupported opinion of an expert. 43 articles met our criteria. In order to record only reports of fibromyxoma and not myxoma, the articles were further sorted, in order to include those reports of fibromyxomas that were mentioned under the general term myxoma. Finally, 19 articles met all criteria and were chosen for further evaluation  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–26\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Table 1 Reported cases of fibromyxoma of the maxilla.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Myxoma/fibromyxoma is a rare odontogenic neoplasm. Fibromyxoma is classified as a specific type of myxoma with a higher fibrous/myxoid tissue ratio than myxoma. There is a discrepancy regarding the reports of fibromyxoma, as many of them are classified under the general term “myxoma”, making the review of the literature difficult. According to Dutz and Stout, the term myxoma was first used by Virchow in 1863, but the term fibromyxoma was described by Marcove et al. in 1964 who reported extragnathic locations of fibromyxoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 28\\]</u>. We use the term myxoma/fibromyxoma as it is being used in many histopathological books in order to describe myxomas of the jaw bones. The review of the literature for previous reports of fibromyxoma was based on case reports that clearly report a “fibromyxoma”.\n\n【20】Myxomas/fibromyxomas are usually located intraorally most often in the posterior regions of the mandible, its angle and ramus and rarely extraorally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 29\\]</u>. The maxilla and anterior region of the mandible are rarely affected. The lesion can be diffused or well defined, uni- or multilocular. It is characterized by a mucous or gelatinous grayish-white tissue that replaces the spongy bone and displaces the cortical plates of the jaws 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Root displacement and resorption may be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It may refer to hard and also to soft tissues.\n\n【21】Previous theories stress that the lesion derives from the neural sheath or is the result of degeneration of fibromas, lipomas and so forth, due to the chronic irritation and the degenerative processes following tissue anoxemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Recent studies advocate that myxomas/fibromyxomas arise from the mesenchymatous tissue of the dental follicle, thus being described as odontogenic with fibroblasts playing the major role in cell dispersal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This explanation fails to describe soft tissue myxomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. They probably arise from supportive structures of the teeth like the gingiva and the periodontal ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Histopathological characteristics of the myxoma/fibromyxoma are the hypocellularity, the presence of stellate, spindle-shaped cells into a loose myxoid extracellular matrix with cells presenting with thin, long cytoplasmic prolongations that give to the tissue characteristics of immature mesenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. The fibromyxoid lesion may present loci of calcification or ossification and a higher amount of collagen fibres and vessels than a typical myxoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The presence of cells positive for actin fibres suggests that myofibroblasts may play a crucial role in cell proliferation in cooperation with the islands of odontogenic epithelium and mast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Myxomas are diagnosed with radiological, histological, and histochemical investigation. The radiological investigation reveals homogenous radiolucencies or sclerotic trabeculations with different appearances, like “honeycomb”, “soap bubble”, and “tennis racket” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. In our case, the lesion appeared as a large radiolucent area with no trabeculations.\n\n【24】Radiological examination plays a crucial role for the differential diagnosis of myxomas/fibromyxomas and also between benign myxomas and malignant neoplasms with myxomatous tissue. In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the lesion shows low-signal intensity in T1 and high-signal intensity in T2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In contrast, Kawai et al. advocate that the high-signal is shown in T1 and not in T2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. These discrepancies may be related to the ratio of fibrous/myxoid tissue, the viscosity, the concentration of proteins, the presence of haemorrhage and the hypocellularity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 31\\]</u>. Immunohistochemical examination uses antibodies against specific biological substances of neuronal, muscular, epithelial, and mesenchymal tissues. The evaluation of the presence of vimentin, an intermediate filament of the cytoskeleton characterises mesenchymal tissues, thus also myxomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Fibromyxomas also contain a high amount of hyaluronic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\n【25】During the process of differential diagnosis pathological conditions that should be included are ameloblastoma, central haemangioma, fibrous dysplasia, odontogenic cysts, aneurysmal cysts, central gigantocytic granuloma, metastatic neoplasms, well-differentiated liposarcoma, and other rare entities like desmoplastic fibroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 33\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The main pathological condition that may lead to difficulties in diagnosis is the ameloblastoma, especially when the bony septa are curviform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. An important characteristic for differential diagnosis is the fact that when a contrast agent (Gd-DTPA) is being administered, in case of the ameloblastoma the MRI shows strong enhancement of the solid portion of the tumor, in contrast to the myxoma that shows homogenous high signal intensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is also important to mention that root displacement and resorption is not unique in ameloblastoma.\n\n【27】The treatment of the fibromyxoma is surgical and involves enucleation and curettage. The avoidance of recurrence is strongly related to the complete resection of the lesion. The patient should be monitored for at least two years after the surgical intervention due to the higher rate of recurrence during this period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Myxomas/fibromyxomas show a recurrence rate between 25% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and 43% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This is strongly related to the nature of the lesion, presenting without a sheath, thus making the complete removal difficult. Other odontogenic tumors, like the keratocyst or the ameloblastoma show a higher recurrence rate of 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>–58,3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u> and 55%–90%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. The frequency of recurrence of a fibromyxoma of the jaws is higher than that of any other bone thus having a poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.\n\n【29】It is stressed that complete resection and peripheral osteotomy is the treatment of choice depending on the size and behaviour of the tumor and results in a lower rate of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7, 33, 37\\]</u>. Simon et al. suggest that radical resection with a margin of 1,5–2 cm of healthy bone is the treatment of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Small bony defects of the maxilla, under 5 cm, can be reconstructed by means of a pedicled buccal fat pad flap (BFP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. Greater bony defects require the positioning of an obturator prior to the reconstruction with a graft.\n\n【30】In conclusion, the maxilla is a rare location of a fibromyxoma. The radiological examination by means of CT and MRI plays an important role in the diagnosis of a fibromyxoma and in the differential diagnosis from other pathological entities such as the ameloblastoma. Its management is surgical and ranges from enucleation and curettage to complete resection and peripheral osteotomy according to its size. Patients must be monitored for at least two years postoperatively in order to diagnose possible recurrence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Our aim is to illustrate two cases of liver injury following the use of black cohosh characterized by histopathological features mimicking autoimmune hepatitis. Both patients reported black cohosh use for at least six months and had no evidence of another cause of liver disease. Their liver biopsies showed a component of centrilobular necrosis consistent with severe drug-induced liver injury. In addition, the biopsies showed characteristics of autoimmune-like liver injury with an interface hepatitis dominated by plasma cells. Although serum markers for autoimmune hepatitis were not particularly elevated, both patients responded to corticosteroids, supporting an immune-mediated component to the liver injury. Liver injury following the use of black cohosh should be included in the list of differential diagnoses for chronic hepatitis with features mimicking autoimmune hepatitis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) is an herbal supplement that is sold over-the-counter for management of menopausal symptoms, menstrual irregularities, and arthritis. There are now a number of manuscripts indicating liver injury from black cohosh 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. Here, we present two patients who developed a drug-induced liver injury following the use of black cohosh characterized by centrilobular necrosis and histologic features mimicking autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) who improved with corticosteroid therapy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Studies\n\n【5】The case series was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\n【6】Case 1. A 42-year-old woman presented to her primary care provider with a two-month history of progressive malaise, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. On physical examination, she had mild icterus and no stigmata of chronic liver disease. Her only comorbidity was hypothyroidism. Her medications included black cohosh, which she was taking for 6 months, and levothyroxine 0.05 mg daily. She discontinued black cohosh when her symptoms began. She had no family history of liver or autoimmune disease. She denied any alcohol or drug use. Her total bilirubin level was 3.1 mg/dL (normal 0.8–1.2), alanine transaminase (ALT) 1457 U/L (normal 5–40), aspartate transaminase (AST) 696 U/L (normal 10–40), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 94 U/L (normal 30–120 U/L), and international normalized ratio (INR) 1.2 (normal 0.8–1.2). Further laboratories showed no serological evidence of active hepatitis A, B, or C infection. Serological titers for acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) were negative. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was 1 : 40 and smooth muscle antibody was modestly elevated at 1 : 80. Serum iron was 169  g/dL (normal: 50 to 170  g/dL for women), ferritin was 642 ng/dL (normal: 15–200 ng/mL for females), and hemochromatosis gene analysis was negative. Ceruloplasmin was in the normal range.  \nFour months after her initial presentation, the liver enzymes remained elevated with an ALT of 334 U/L, AST 229 U/L, and a total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL. A liver biopsy was performed which prompted a referral to the liver center at the University of Illinois. The liver biopsy was remarkable for necrosis around terminal hepatic venules, lobular disarray, mild ballooning, apoptosis, Kupffer cell reactivity, mild cholangiolar proliferation, and interface hepatitis remarkable for numerous plasma cells and eosinophils. A repeat antismooth muscle antibody was normal at 1 : 20. Prednisone treatment was initiated. A follow-up liver biopsy was performed after three months. At this time, the liver histology demonstrated chronic hepatitis with fibroinflammatory expansion of portal tracts by moderate plasma cell rich interface hepatitis, rare periportal hepatocyte apoptosis, and mild cholangiolar proliferation 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u>. The patient was started on azathioprine. Her liver enzymes returned to normal values within five months with an ALT of 30 U/L, AST of 29 U/L, ALP 36 U/L, and a total bilirubin of 0.9 mg/dL. A repeat liver biopsy after fifteen months showed marked improvement with only minimal portal lymphocytes and no other significant histopathological changes. The liver function test values remained normal at 15 months and at 40 months following the acute episode. The clinicopathological features of Case 1 are illustrated in Tables 1, 2, and 3.\n\n【7】Table 1 Current case studies: clinical features and medications.\n\n【8】Table 2 Current case studies: past medical history, serological tests, and other pertinent laboratory data.\n\n【9】Table 3 Duration of Illness and black cohosh use, liver function tests, autoimmune markers, histology, and treatment.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | This liver biopsy from Case 1 displays chronic hepatitis remarkable for its dense interface activity with cholangiolar proliferation (1a) (×200) and sheets of plasma cells and apoptosis (1b) (×600). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】Case 2. A 53-years-old woman presented to our liver center for evaluation of elevated liver enzymes detected at a health screening fair four months earlier. She had no risk factors for viral hepatitis, no family history of liver disease, and denied any alcohol consumption. Although she was initially asymptomatic, she developed right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, and lower extremity edema by the time of her presentation. Her medical history was remarkable only for irritable bowel syndrome. Her medications within the past year included dicyclomine for abdominal cramps as needed, an herbal supplement which contains soy protein and black cohosh for menopausal symptoms, and occasional over the counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain. She discontinued these medications on the advice of her primary care physician. Laboratories showed a total bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dL, ALT 443 U/L, AST 478 U/L, ALP 188 U/L, and an INR of 2.0. Other notable laboratory values included negative serological evidence of active hepatitis A, B, and C viral infection, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR, iron 137  g/dL, ferritin 1527 ng/mL, negative hemochromatosis gene analysis, and nonsignificant ceruloplasmin level. Serological tests for antinuclear, antismooth muscle, antiliver kidney microsomal, and antimitochondrial antibodies were negative. An ultrasound demonstrated patent portal and hepatic veins and a normal appearing liver. Her liver biopsy was remarkable for centrilobular necrosis with moderate cholangiolar proliferation and plasma cell rich interface and lobular hepatitis.  \nThe patient was started on 40 mg of prednisone daily. Liver function test values improved to a total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL, ALT of 60 U/L, AST 50 U/L, and ALP 153 U/L after two weeks and normalized after five weeks of therapy. The clinicopathological features of Case 2 are illustrated in Tables 1, 2, and 4.\n\n【12】Table 4 Duration of Illness and black cohosh use, liver function tests, autoimmune markers and histology.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Application of the Naranjo Causality Score for Adverse Drug Reactions\n\n【14】The Naranjo causality score for adverse drug reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> was applied to the cases described here. As shown in Table 5, the current case studies individually achieved a Naranjo score of 3 and were both categorized as “possible adverse drug reaction”, in a scale encompassing a minimum score of zero, or “doubtful adverse drug reaction” to a maximum score of 9, or “definite adverse drug reaction.”\n\n【15】Table 5 Naranjo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> Causality Scale for Adverse Drug Reactions.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Application of the Hennes-Simplified Criteria for Diagnosis of Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH)\n\n【17】While the current case studies showed histopathological features of autoimmune hepatitis, neither fulfilled a diagnosis of “probable AIH” or “definite AIH” based on the Hennes simplified criteria for diagnosis of AIH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Briefly, Case 1 had an ANA titer of up to 1 : 80 (score 2), no available immunoglobulin titers (no score), a liver histology compatible with AIH (score 1), and absence of viral hepatitis (score 2), with a total score of 5. Case 2 had a score of 1-0-1-2 4, on a scale where a score of 6 was designated “probable AIH”, and 7 as “definite AIH.”\n\n【18】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Botanical dietary supplements are used commonly in the United States and are generally perceived to be safe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In one study, nearly one half of persons reported use of at least one agent to their primary provider 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. A major difficulty in studying black cohosh is uncertainty regarding the composition of the various black cohosh products. Black cohosh itself contains a number of secondary compounds including phenolic derivatives and triterpene glycosides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Phytoestrogens were postulated to play a role in black cohosh binding to estrogen receptors, but the presence of these compounds is controversial. In one study, chromatographic analysis of 11 commercial black cohosh products showed that three were actually Asian Actea species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. An analysis of the remaining eight products found variability in the composition of triterpene glycosides and phenolic constituents. More importantly, not a single product contained a phytoestrogen. Thus, the mechanism by which black cohosh might impact on alleviating menopausal symptoms is not well understood. Other possibilities include binding to yet-to-be-defined receptors or effects on the central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Whether black cohosh is effective in controlling vasomotor symptoms of menopause is controversial as well. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology included black cohosh as a possible remedy for the vasomotor symptoms of menopause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. A large randomized-blinded trial of one-year duration found no difference between black cohosh and placebo in controlling vasomotor symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Moreover, a recent review did not recommend long-term use due to the absence of safety evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【20】There are a growing number of case reports of hepatotoxicity in patients taking black cohosh  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. Most described acute hepatic necrosis, although three articles of them detailed a case with clinical features of autoimmune hepatitis after black cohosh use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 5\\]</u>. The clinicopathological features of the cases in the current series have a fascinating combination of findings. Both patients presented with an acute hepatitis displaying prominent centrilobular necrosis consistent with severe drug-induced liver injury. While autoantibodies were low titer or absent, the histology showed characteristics of autoimmune hepatitis with a plasma cell rich interface and lobular hepatitis. In addition, both patients responded to corticosteroids, supporting an immune mediated component to the liver injury.\n\n【21】Table 6 Similarities and differences among current case studies and published cases of black cohosh hepatotoxicity.\n\n【22】Determining the risk of black cohosh hepatotoxicity is further complicated by variability in both dosage and number of other botanical herbal supplements contained in some preparations. As an example, in the case reported by Lontos 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, the preparation of black cohosh included 4 other botanicals: ground ivy, golden seal, gingko, and oat seeds. While liver injury remains unreported with the use of the last 3 botanicals, ground ivy contains a known hepatotoxin, pulegone. This case culminated in liver failure despite discontinuation of the herbal supplement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Drug interactions might further potentiate negative outcomes resulting from hepatoxicity due to herbal supplements. That subjects in 3 of 5 reported cases of autoimmune-like liver injury following consumption of black cohosh  also had concomitant intake of synthetic thyroid hormone, levothyroxine, merits attention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>. Herbal supplements such as venencapsan and black cohosh, and prescription drugs specifically rosiglitazone, ritonavir, and valproic acid, have had reported drug interactions with levothyroxine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 9, 18–22\\]</u>.\n\n【24】A 2008 review by Mahady assigned all known case reports of black cohosh-induced liver injury under the category of “possible causality” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. As earlier stated, both cases of the current study were also assigned “possible causality” by Naranjo scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Although no clinical or animal pharmacokinetic or toxicological information were identified in the Mahady review, it led to the inclusion of a cautionary statement on black cohosh products which was not previously required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Despite such development, the use of botanical dietary supplements is generally viewed by the public as safe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Providers are encouraged to screen patients about their consumption of botanical herbal supplements and to assess for any evidence of liver injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Timely discontinuation of hepatotoxic agents and, in some cases, early initiation of immunotherapy might prevent significant liver injury or could even be life saving 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The validity of reported cases of liver injury due to black cohosh illustrated in Table 6 has been disputed. Concerns that led to this uncertainty included cases in which the timing of liver injury occurred at a relatively short interval following exposure to black cohosh 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 7\\]</u>, presence of comorbidities such as cholelithhiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> or concomittant use of drugs other than black cohosh that could have potentially triggered the adverse drug reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4, 7\\]</u>, or the notion that some of the reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, including Case 1 of the current study (also reported by Mahady 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>), were indeed examples of autoimmune hepatitis rather than adverse drug reactions. Nonetheless, application of the Naranjo causality score to these case reports found possible cause for adverse drug reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Further, autoimmune hepatitis is one of the known outcomes of drug-induced liver injury. The immune mechanism is precipitated by a drug or a metabolite acting as a hapten covalently binding to host cellular protein, converting into an immunogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and thereby eliciting an autoimmune response. Outcomes illustrating an association of chronic hepatitis with autoimmune features developing following the use of the botanical supplement black cohosh need to be emphasized.\n\n【26】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【27】Here we described two cases of liver injury following the use of black cohosh characterized by chronic hepatitis with centrilobular necrosis and an interface activity dominated by plasma cells. While the histopathology in both cases was compatible with autoimmune hepatitis, clinical evidence for an autoimmune etiology was lacking. Nonetheless both cases improved upon withdrawal of the drug and immunosuppressive therapy, indicating that there was at least in part a drug-induced immunological basis to the liver injury.\n\n【28】The current case studies, and three other published cases of liver injury following the use of black cohosh, share similar histological characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 5\\]</u>. Hepatic manifestations following the use of black cohosh should therefore be added to the list of differential diagnoses of hepatic necrosis culminating in chronic hepatitis mimicking autoimmune hepatitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is a well-circumscribed lesion that clinically is often thought to represent a Bartholin's gland cyst and usually does not form a pedunculated mass. To our knowledge, only five cases of vulvar AMFB with pedunculated mass have been reported in the English literature and all cases involving the labia majora and middle-aged women. We report the first case of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva occurring in a young woman of 21 years old and involving the left labia minora. After excluding the most common diseases, pedunculated AMFB should be part of differential diagnosis in the workup of any pedunculated vulvar mass even in young women with a lesion involving the labia minora. We reviewed the literature and summarized all reported cases.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Angiomyofibroblastoma (AMFB) is a rare benign mesenchymal tumor usually occurring in the vulvovaginal area of middle-aged women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Histologically, the tumor is a well-circumscribed lesion composed of alternating hypo- and hypercellular areas with numerous delicate capillary-sized vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. AMFB can be distinguished from the aggressive angiomyxoma by its circumscribed borders, the presence of plump stromal cells, and perivascular condensation of the stromal cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Immunoreactivity for both desmin and vimentin is detected in almost all tumor cells, which also reveal estrogen and progesterone receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Clinically, AMFB shows a slowly growing mass which is often misdiagnosed as a Bartholin’s gland cyst and usually does not form a pedunculated mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. To our knowledge, only five cases of vulvar AMFB with pedunculated mass have been reported in the English literature and all cases involving the labia majora and middle-aged women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7–10\\]</u>. We report the first case of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva occurring in a young woman of 21 years old and involving the left labia minora.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 21-year-old woman came to our observation reporting the presence of a painless vulvar neoformation starting four years before, which had grown during the last months. She ignored the mass, despite its gradual enlargement during her disease course, and the complaint was of discomfort when seated and a localized burning sensation. Her personal history was noncontributory for previous surgery and laboratory data (emocrome, transaminase, sideremia, ferritin, creatinine, coagulation) showed no significant abnormalities. Clinical examination showed a pedunculated bilobulated neoformation of ten centimeters in diameter of tense elastic consistency, at the level of the left labia minora . On gynecological examination and vaginal ultrasound, the uterus and bilateral uterine adnexae showed no abnormalities. Inguinal lymph nodes were not swollen and tumor markers (cancer antigen (CA) 125, CA-19.9, CA-15.3, Alphafetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen) were negative. These markers were performed to exclude a concomitant malignancy in other locations. On ultrasound examination the mass revealed a well-demarcated soft tissue tumor with homogeneous echo and normal vascularity. In order to exclude a surgical disease, such as perineal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–13\\]</u>, the patient was evaluated by surgeons that, according with personal history, clinical examination, and ultrasonography, excluded a lesion of their interest.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | The tumor shows a pedunculated large mass arising from the labia minora with a subtle stalk. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】The mass gave a clinical impression of vulvar fibroid, and a simple tumor excision was subsequently performed at the site of the stalk. During surgery, to exclude a malignancy lesion, a rapid intraoperative pathologic diagnosis of the tumor was performed, and it was reported as a benign soft lesion of the vulva. On gross examination, the lesion was well circumscribed, weighed 1230 gr, had a soft to firm consistency, and appeared homogeneously light gray to tan in color on the cut surface. No foci of hemorrhage nor necrosis was detected.\n\n【8】Microscopically, the mass consisted of fibroconnective tissue with abundant vessels of various wall thickness 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>. No mitotic or atypical cells were seen, and the stroma was edematous. In immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were strongly positive for desmin and estrogen receptors 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(a) and 3(b))</u> and negative for 𝛼 \\-smooth muscle actin, S-100 protein, cytokeratin, and CD34.

Discussion\n\n【13】This distinctive tumor was first delineated by Fletcher et al. in 1992 who described 10 cases involving the vulva 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> with only one case reporting a large pedunculated mass. There is a marked predilection for the female genital tract, predominantly the vulva, although rare cases have also been reported to arise in the scrotum and the inguinal area in males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 14\\]</u>. The female patients have an average age of 45.8 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. They usually complain of a painless mass that has been present from a few weeks to up to 13 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Clinically, these tumors are frequently thought to be a Bartholin gland cyst, although a preoperative differential diagnosis includes labial cysts, inguinal hernia, leiomyoma, and mesenchymal tumors such as lipoma and liposarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【14】On gross examination they are typically well circumscribed and ranged from 0.5 to 12 cm. They have a soft to rubbery consistency and a bulging, pink, and somewhat lobulated sectioned surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Microscopic examination confirms the well-demarcated nature of the lesion and shows alternating hypercellular and hypocellular edematous regions with abundant blood vessels. There is minimal nuclear atypicality, and mitotic figures are rare. The cells tend to cluster around blood vessels, sometime forming compact foci 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Adipocytes can be sparsely scattered within the neoplasm and in rare cases fat predominates; these tumors have been classified as the “lipomatous” variant of angiomyofibroblastoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The angiomyofibroblastoma can be distinguished from the aggressive angiomyxoma by its circumscribed borders, the presence of plump stromal cells that are occasionally overtly epithelioid, and perivascular condensation of the stromal cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. A single case of a malignant transformation of an AMFB in angiomyofibrosarcoma has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In that tumor, areas of typical AMFB merged imperceptibly with high-grade sarcoma resembling a myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma.\n\n【15】Immunohistochemical stains show uniform staining for vimentin and staining of a variable number of cells for desmin in most cases. The tumor cells also show variable expression for muscle actin and smooth muscle actin and are frequently positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors suggests that it might arise as a neoplastic proliferation of hormonally responsible mesenchymal cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Some tumors have also stained for CD34, although some authors question whether these CD34 positive tumors might present fibroepithelial polyps, which are frequently positive for this marker 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The tumor usually exists as a sharply circumscribed mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the vulva and usually does not form a pedunculated mass, which represents an exceptional event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. To our knowledge, only five cases of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva have been reported in the English literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7–10\\]</u>.\n\n【17】All cases are reported in Table 1. All patients underwent simple excision. The mean age of patients was 46.4 years with a range of 41–50 years. The lesion always involved the labia majora. The average size of the pedunculated AMFB was of 14.2 × 13.6 centimeters in diameter (range 4 to 23 cm). Except for one case, the presence of the lesion had existed for several years. The real problem is the preoperative clinical diagnosis, as the vulvar AMFB is a rare event revealed only by histological examination after surgery. All patients had an uneventful postoperative course, and the mean followup was of 20 months (ranging from 8 months to 3 years) with no recurrence.\n\n【18】Table 1 Clinical features of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva.\n\n【19】Table 2 shows immunohistochemical staining for the most common antibodies in the AMFB. Almost all tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin and desmin, but uniformly negative for cytokeratin and S-100 protein. Not all tumor cells were negative for 𝛼 \\-smooth muscle actin and CD34. Staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors was observed in the nucleus of all tumor cells.\n\n【20】Table 2 Immunohistochemical staining for the most common antibodies in the AMFB.\n\n【21】Given the data reported in the literature on the pedunculated AMFB of the vulva, our case is the first concerning a young woman of 21 years old and involving the labia minora. The patient underwent simple excision with clear margin of the lesion and currently is in followup performing clinical examination every six months for two years with no recurrence.\n\n【22】This paper aims to emphasize that, after excluding the most common vulvar diseases, the appearance of a pedunculated AMFB should be part of differential diagnosis in the workup of any pedunculated vulvar mass even in young women with a lesion involving the labia minora. The treatment of choice is a surgical excision with clear margins, which is resolutive as demonstrated by reported cases in the literature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Muscle pain and penile erection disappeared seven days after interruption of therapy. This case demonstrates the interaction of tadalafil with simvastatin resulting in myopathy. Muscle damage could be attributed to the common metabolic way of these two drugs which is cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Cardiovascular disease and erectile dysfunction (ED) share similar etiologic and pathophysiologic pathway. Mainly it is well known that most cases of ED derive from an impairment of the vascular endothelium. Recent epidemiological studies have underlined the close association between ED and comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. Actually phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy for erection problems of all etiologies and severities, at the same time statins are a recommended therapy for vascular disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Pharmacologic data support a potential interactions between these drugs because PDE5 inhibitors and statins are metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450. In this family of enzymes, CYP3A is the dominant CYP in terms of both expression levels in the liver and the number of drugs metabolized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Both simvastatin and tadalafil metabolism involve principally CYP3A. The metabolism of simvastatin in human liver microsomes is catalysed primarily ( 80%) by CYP3A4/5, with a minor contribution ( 20%) from CYP2C8. Tadalafil during its metabolism is converted to a metabolite that binds irreversibly to the enzyme active site, permanently inactivating the enzyme. The inactivated enzyme must be replaced by newly synthesized CYP to regain activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Today in addition to the classical proerectile-effect, several studies have demonstrated that PDE5 can also influence vascular endothelium; given that the combinated therapy statins plus PDE5 could be very useful in patient with high cardiovascular risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 48-year-old man with a history of dyslipidemia and erectile dysfunction was admitted to our department due to a manifestation of progressive myalgia after comsumption of tadalafil. He had been taking simvastatin at doses of 20 mg/die for almost 8 days and recently he was prescribed tadalafil. Approximately 3 hours after the patient began tadalafil, he developed unexplained, severe muscle aches (particularly in the lower extremities). Gradually, these symptoms worsened with severe pain in the 3/5 of surface area over upper extremities and 2/5 of surface area over lower extremities, weakness in the pelvic and shoulder girdle regions. The penile erection was maintained for five days. According to his clinical history we stopped tadalafil and simvastatin therapy and we noted a significant improvement in muscular symptoms after 5 days. Further questioning revealed no symptoms of viral illness, or other identifiable causes of myalgias. He denied unusual or abnormal physical activity, trauma, burns, recent intramuscular injections or symptoms of coronary artery disease. His temperature was 37°C, pulse rate 87 b/min and blood pressure 125/75 mmHg. Laboratoristic analysis are reported in the Table 1. No substantial changes in the ECG were noted. Myopathy, probably drug induced, was diagnosed because there was no evidence of recent trauma or other potential causes of muscle damage. An intravenous fluid supplement was prescribed, but the weakness decreased slightly after he was discharged.\n\n【6】Table 1 Serum values of some parameters during 5 days.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【8】Approximately 95% of statin-treated patients tolerate this treatment without any adverse effects. Tadalafil (Cialis) is a potent reversible phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Physiologically, in response to sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released into the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum of the penis, resulting in elevation of cGMP levels and relaxation of the smooth muscle to produce an erection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Patients who are treated for erectile dysfunction are likely to take additional medications for preexisting conditions such as cardiovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Statins and tadalafil are both metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system (particularly CYP3A4). In this family of enzymes, CYP3A is the dominant CYP in terms of both expression levels in the liver and the number of drugs metabolized. As a result of the broad substrate specificity exhibited by CYP3A and the polypharmacy often used by patients, alterations in CYP3A activity by induction or inhibition can result in metabolically based drug-drug interactions. In vitro studies were performed examining the ability of tadalafil to alter metabolism mediated by CYP3A in cultures of human hepatocytes or reversibly inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A in human liver microsomes. In addition, tadalafil was examined for its ability to cause mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A-mediated reactions in human liver microsomes. Mechanism-based inhibition occurs when the drug is converted to a metabolite that binds irreversibly to the enzyme active site, permanently inactivating the enzyme. The inactivated enzyme must be replaced by newly synthesized CYP to regain activity; thus recovery is slowed after mechanism-based inactivation as compared with reversible inhibition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Other in vitro studies evaluated the effect of tadalafil on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A such as lovastatin. This study remarks that side effects such as myopathy could be even higher if a statin is used concomitantly with one of the most potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as tadalafil. So their concomitant use should be avoided. Though the meaning of this case is yet not clear, we speculate that this fatigue may be due to a low-grade muscle damage induced by tadalafil. Muscle toxicity is a potential adverse effect not only for statins, but also with 5PD . So a combination of tadalafil and statins may enhance the effect and induce muscle toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. In the patients treated with statins, tadalafil should not be the PDE5 inhibitors of first choice, because of its long half-life in order to avoid potentially life-threatening adverse effects.\n\n【9】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【10】Statins are used to reduce blood cholesterol and have been shown in multiple studies to reduce the risk of heart attacks, heart attack deaths, and strokes. The benefits of treating blood cholesterol with statins have been demonstrated in a wide variety of patient groups, including healthy patients. The major medical problem with statins is that they can produce muscle aching, weakness, and cramps in some patients. The incidence of myopathy could be even higher if simvastatin is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as 5PDi. Moreover muscle toxicity is a potential adverse effect not only for statins, but also with 5PDi so their concomitant use should be carefully monitored. Specially in the patients treated with statins, tadalafil should not be the PDE5 inhibitors of first choice, because of its long half-life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. At the same time the best statin to use might be rosuvastatin because it is not extensively metabolized by isoenzymes of the CYP system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The patient subsequently developed postherpetic neuralgia in the same dermatome, which, after remission, transformed into paroxysmal trigeminal pain. The two different symptom sets, with the former consistent with PHN and the later consistent with trigeminal neuralgia, were unique to our practice and the literature.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Herpes zoster (HZ) is classified as the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and is commonly known as shingles. HZ causes an inflammatory immune response, which affects the ganglia of the sensory nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. While often self-limiting, in an estimated 10% of patients this can lead to chronic pain in the affected dermatome(s) known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, which is characterized by constant variable symptoms including burning pain in the affected dermatome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Discretely different pathophysiologically and affecting the trigeminal dermatomes, trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a neuropathic pain disorder characterized symptomatically by a sudden and severe stabbing pain. It is classically associated with microvascular compression of the trigeminal nerve but other etiologies have been suggested and are discussed below 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】This report examines a novel case of a patient who is experiencing both PHN and TN, the first reported in the literature.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】Seventy-two-year-old female diagnosed with left ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1) HZ with associated cutaneous vesicles. This was self-limited in its course, although she then subsequently developed PHN in the same dermatome, characterized by a burning pain that was constant. This constant burning paraesthesia in her left V1 persisted for approximately five years and gradually improved. Then, without an inciting event, approximately 12 months prior to presentation in our office, she was experiencing a paroxysmal, lancing, sharp and painful, stabbing-like pain in the V1 dermatome that was triggered by eating, brushing teeth, and occasionally yawning. A brain MRI was done to rule out multiple sclerosis or structural abnormality. The two different symptom sets, with the former consistent with PHN and the later consistent with TN, were unique to our practice and the literature.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Herpes zoster affects approximately 4 patients/1,000 Americans per year. Fifty-six percent of patients have thoracic dermatomes affected; up to 25% of patients have cranial trigeminal nerve involvement, most commonly the first division 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Pathophysiologically in HZ, varicella zoster virus can become latent, typically in the neuronal cell bodies. Years or decades later, the virus may become activated and migrate distally along the axon, leading to cutaneous manifestation of the infection of HZ. Postherpetic neuralgia can occur with injury secondary to altered gene expression in the sensory nerves that can induce neurochemical, physiological, and/or anatomical modifications (such as afferent terminal sprouting) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. This can lead to a hyperexcitable state of the neuron that is associated with PHN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The immune system responds to the activation of the virus and produces anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which can further damage the nerves of the dorsal root ganglia. These molecules can also cause pain by directly influencing the activity of nociceptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is estimated that 10% of HZ patients develop PHN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Risk factors for PHN include advanced age, greater acute pain, severe rash, prodromal pain, ophthalmic location, and possibly female sex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. By the age of 60 years old, the risk increases to 60% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The incidence of HZ patients who develop PHN also varies depending on the definition of the condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Trigeminal neuralgia was found to have an incidence of 2–5/100,000/year, making it much less common than PHN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Like PHN, risk for TN increases with age. Incidence was found to increase to 17.5/100,000/year for ages 60–69 and 25.6/100,000/year after age 70 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Although there are many idiopathic cases of TN, it has been found to be comorbid with such disorders as arterial hypertension, Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Other, more common, etiologies include vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve and multiple sclerosis (2%–4% of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Trigeminal neuralgia is caused most commonly by microvascular compression of the trigeminal root at the root entry zone, which is thought to cause demyelination at that location. The mechanism is thought to be neuronal depolarization leading to over production of action potentials, resulting in nonevoked pain responses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Multiple sclerosis is also a well-studied etiology of TN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Postherpetic neuralgia has been classified into three subtypes; irritable nociceptor with allodynia, deafferentation with allodynia, and deafferentation without allodynia. Irritable nociceptor with allodynia is characterized by severe pain, mechanical allodynia, and minimal loss of heat sensation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Deafferentation either with or without allodynia differs in that patients have deficits in thermal sensation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Although patients with typical TN may have allodynia, but this disorder is characterized by sudden attacks of sharp, stabbing pain induced by mechanical, chemical, and thermal stimuli and lasting only a few seconds to a few minutes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Atypical TN is also characterized by these paroxysmal pains, but includes a constant pain as well; other variants are also reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Although allodynia due to PHN and TN are similar in the clinical view, the distinction between the two comes from their natural histories 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Postherpetic neuralgia is a neuropathic pain that has a clear origin from the infection with the herpes zoster virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Trigeminal neuralgia has a spontaneous onset and has an idiopathic nature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. A study by Attal et al. found that typical TN was consistent with electric shock like pain only, while PHN patients typically experienced allodynia and burning pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. This suggests that although certain subtypes of PHN and TN are clinically similar, these two conditions can occur independently and that a single patient can present with both PHN and TN, as seen in this case.\n\n【13】The patient in this case report experienced distinct cases of PHN and TN. She initially developed the characteristic constant burning pain associated with PHN, which then essentially resolved. She then later developed the sudden stabbing pain by the triggers noted above, a pain more clearly associated with TN. There seem to be no other reported cases of patients experiencing these distinct consecutive conditions. The consideration of a reactivation of HZ, with development of a different subtype of postherpetic neuralgia was considered, although the patient denied any of the symptoms typically associated with HZ with the appearance of the secondary pain; additionally, the symptoms of the secondary pain syndrome were identical to that of TN. Alternatively, one could hypothesize that the irritated or damaged sensory nerve from the PHN may have been predisposed to the microvascular insult classically associated with TN. Regardless of the mechanism, this novel case reminds the clinician to be cognizant of the nuances and potential overlap of postherpetic and trigeminal neuralgias without any pathophysiological links between the two diseases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We also review the findings in other cases previously described in the literature.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primary retroperitoneal melanoma (PRM) is an extremely rare form of malignant extracutaneous melanoma with a poor prognosis. Although malignant melanomas arise from the skin in vast majority of cases, they can also appear in other organs where melanocytes are present including the eye, meninges and mucosa, and much less commonly in the retroperitoneal space. Diagnosis of a retroperitoneal melanoma requires a thorough cutaneous, mucosal, and ocular exam to ensure there are no primary lesions in these areas that may have metastasized to the retroperitoneal space. In this case report, we present a rare case of primary retroperitoneal melanoma with involvement of the left iliac artery and vein.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 65-year-old Caucasian female presented with a two-week history of left lower extremity swelling and pain. The patient stated that the swelling slightly improved with elevation of her legs and that the pain was partially alleviated with NSAIDs. The patient denied any shortness of breath, recent trauma, fever, chest pain, or unexplained weight loss. She had a past medical history significant for inflammatory polyarthritis (on methotrexate and Humira), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, osteopenia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She had been taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation with international normalized ratio (INR) levels within the therapeutic range. The patient had a history of three-pack years of smoking but stated she quit approximately 40 years ago.\n\n【6】On physical examination, the presence of pitting edema of her left lower extremity was noted . There were strong peripheral pulses, and her abdomen was soft and nondistended. Blood work was significant for severe hypokalemia (2.8 mEq/L), which was repleted in clinic. Both erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels were checked and found to be elevated at 35.0 mm/hr and 30.1 mg/L, respectively. An ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity was negative for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A computed tomography (CT) angiography of the abdomen/pelvis was then performed and revealed a large heterogeneous left pelvic retroperitoneal mass centered at the left iliac chain region spanning 8.7 × 6.9 × 8.5 cm with probable compression/occlusion of the adjacent iliac vein . Based on the imaging study, the differential diagnosis included sarcoma, lymphoma, ovarian neoplasm, or germ cell tumor.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Patient’s initial presentation of left lower extremity edema.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Computed tomography of the abdomen reveals 8.7 × 6.9 × 8.5 cm mass (red arrow) in the retroperitoneal space.</u>\n\n【9】A CT-guided abdominal mass needle core biopsy was performed, and the sample was sent for H&E staining 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u> as well as immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Immunostaining showed that the tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive for SOX10 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b))</u> but were negative for CK7, CK20, GATA3, and PAX8. These immunohistochemical stain findings support a diagnosis of melanoma. The tumor cells were also positive for S100 immunostaining 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c))</u> and BRAF V600E mutation, thereby further confirming the diagnosis. Upon review of the case and the CT scan, surgical oncology determined that the mass was surgically unresectable due to invasion of the adjacent iliac vessels. A comprehensive workup was performed to search for primary and secondary involvement of other sites, including an MRI brain and brainstem with no contrast and a full body PET scan, both of which were unremarkable.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 (a) Nest of tumor cells showing areas of necrosis (H&E, original magnification ×100).

Therefore, a diagnosis of primary retroperitoneal melanoma was rendered. The patient was also referred to an oncologist who offered the patient clinical trial for EA6134 (a randomized phase III trial of dabrafenib and trametinib followed by ipilimumab and nivolumab) since the tumor contained the mutation BRAF V600. Five months after being started on the clinical trial, the patient was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and encephalopathy. She was evaluated by an oncologist who determined that her encephalopathy was the result of her chemotherapy, and her participation in the trial was therefore withdrawn. The patient was discharged to a hospice facility and succumbed to the disease one month later, six months after her initial diagnosis.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Melanoma, a malignancy arising from melanocytes, is the deadliest form of cutaneous malignancy. Most malignant melanomas arise from the skin, and only 5% of all primary melanomas arise from extracutaneous tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Extracutaneous malignant melanomas are extremely rare and aggressive lesions, and therefore the rarity and aggressive nature of this disease make its diagnosis and treatment a challenging task. To date, only 7 cases of PRM have been reported in the English-language literature  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–8\\]</u>. The initial symptoms of primary retroperitoneal melanoma can be nonspecific and include fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, and leg swelling; however, of these 7 previously reported cases and our own 8<sup>th</sup> case, some specific presenting signs can be identified. In 4 of the 8 cases (50%), patients presented with abdominal pain, in three cases (38%) with abdominal distension/fullness, and in one case with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5, 8\\]</u>. CT plays an important role in the diagnosis of primary retroperitoneal melanoma as it can localize the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However, immunohistochemical stains are required for the definitive diagnosis of PRM. Both cutaneous and noncutaneous melanomas exhibit the same immunohistochemical and structural features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite the variety of immunohistochemical markers for melanoma, S100 remains the most sensitive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In addition, SOX10 is a transcription factor that has also been shown to be a sensitive marker of melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Both S100 and SOX10 immunostains were positive in our case. The patient’s melanoma also contained a mutation in the BRAF gene, which is present in approximately 50% of cases of advanced melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Negative immunostaining for CK7, CK20, GATA3, and PAX8 also played a vital role in ruling out other probable malignancies and arriving at the diagnosis of melanoma. For instance, PAX8 is a specific and sensitive marker for renal and ovarian carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and protein GATA3 has been previously reported to be expressed in epithelial proliferations of the female genital tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Table 1 Literature review of other reported cases of PRM.\n\n【15】Clear guidelines for the treatment of primary retroperitoneal malignant melanoma have not yet been defined due to the rarity of this disease, and therefore, therapy is based on evidence derived from the treatment of cutaneous melanoma. The mainstay of therapy for melanoma remains surgical resection, but if the tumor is surgically unresectable or in the case of more advanced disease, then systemic therapy is recommended.

Introduction\n\n【3】Although RCC occasionally invades the renal pelvis and ureter microscopically, massive extension into the renal pelvis and ureter is a rare event. Herein, we describe a case with an RCC growing in the renal pelvis and ureter and reaching the bladder.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 51-year-old female visited us due to asymptomatic macroscopic hematuria persisting for two weeks. She had experienced discomfort, not pain, in the stomach. She had been followed up at another clinic for polycythemia for several years. Cystoscopy revealed a nonpapillary tumor about 2 cm in diameter, emanating from the left ureteral orifice . Blood results at presentation showed Hb 14.8 g/dL, Cr 0.7 mg/dL, estimated GFR 68.1 mL/min, WBC /μL, CRP 5.35 mg/dL, LDH 184 IU/L, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> 9.9 mg/dL. Urine cytology was negative for malignant cells.Contrast enhanced CT showed an unevenly contrasted tumor, infiltrating almost all renal parenchyma, filling the renal pelvis and ureter, and extending into the urinary bladder . There were no apparent metastases to lung, liver, adrenal glands, or lymph nodes. With a tentative diagnosis of renal pelvic tumor, we didnot perform perioperative biopsy, and she underwent nephroureterectomy with hilar lymph node dissection. Macroscopically the tumor almost replaced the whole kidney. The renal pelvis and ureter were extensively packed with the tumor. Histological examination  revealed a clear cell RCC, grade 2 > 1, with microvascular invasion, Fuhrman grade 2, without any sarcomatoid elements. There was no evidence of a venous thrombus or metastasis to lymph nodes. Leibovich score was 6. Postoperative course was uneventful, but 6 months later multiple pulmonary metastases were detected.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Cystoscopy showed the tumor emanating from the left ureteral orifice. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】(a) Horizontal view\n\n【8】(b) Sagittal view\n\n【9】(a) Horizontal view  \n(b) Sagittal view\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Contrast enhanced CT showed a left renal tumor with heterogenous enhancement .

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is frequently associated with emotional stress, but to date no cases of STEMI triggering TCM have been reported. We describe a case of a female patient with ST-elevation myocardial infarction complicated by TCM.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 82-year old female patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia and osteoporosis was admitted to the emergency department of a community hospital with chest pain. On admission she did not report about an obvious emotional stress situation. She was under chronic therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/od), simvastatin (20 mg/od) and esomeprazole (20 mg/od). Initially she had a pulse rate of 68 beats/min and a blood pressure of 116/81 mmHg. Her physical examination was normal. The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and ST-elevations in the leads II, aVF, and V2–V6 . ST-elevation myocardial infarction was diagnosed, and the patient received acetylsalicylic acid (500 mg i.v), clopidogrel (600 mg p.o.), and unfractionated heparin (5000 IE i.v.) and was immediately transferred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (primary PCI) to our catheter laboratory. Time from symptom onset to primary PCI was 8 hours. The immediately performed coronary angiography revealed coronary three-vessel disease with a 50% stenosis in the LAD, a 50% stenosis in the right coronary artery, and a subtotal occlusion (99%) of the circumflex coronary artery . The left anterior descending coronary artery was not a large wrap-around vessel and did not supply the midinferior segment. We performed a primary PCI with bare metal stenting of the circumflex coronary artery (Coroflex Blue 2,5/8 mm). Angiogram showed a left ventricular dysfunction with preserved basal function and moderate-to-severe dysfunction in the midventricle and apical regions . Laboratory testing revealed elevated levels of Troponin T (0.56 ng/mL, (UNL: < 0.03 ng/mL)) and creatinine kinase (214 U/L, (UNL: < 145 U/L)). Catecholamine plasma levels were not measured. During the hospital stay the patient received fondaparinux (2,5 mg/od), beta blockers (metoprolol 47,5 mg/td), ACE inhibitors (ramipril 2,5 mg/td), acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/od), clopidogrel (75 mg/od), statins (simvastatin 40 mg/od), and proton-pump inhibitors (esomeprazol 20 mg/od). Echocardiography on day 3, as well as contrast enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMI) on day 5, still showed a moderate reduced ejection fraction with typical apical ballooning. CMI showed a hyperenhancement confined to the lateral wall . A left ventricular hypertrophy, a dynamic LVOT obstruction, or a valvular heart disease was not observed on echocardiography or on CMI. ECG on day 7 showed a sinus rhythm and T-inversions in the leads V2–V6. Echocardiography on day 11 showed a mildly reduced ejection fraction. Wall motion abnormalities in the apical regions were not present anymore. Only an impaired lateral contractility could still be observed. Her recovery was uneventful, and she was doing well at discharge. She was discharged with a chronic medication including betablockers (metoprolol 47,5 mg/td), ACE-inhibitors (ramipril 2,5 mg/td), acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/od), clopidogrel (75 mg/od), statins (simvastatin 40 mg/od), and proton-pump inhibitors (esomeprazol 20 mg/od).\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and ST-elevations in the leads II, aVF, and V2–V6. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Coronary angiography revealing a 50% stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery and a subtotal occlusion (99%) of the circumflex coronary artery. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | Coronary angiography revealing a 50% stenosis in the right coronary artery. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 | Angiogram showing a left ventricular dysfunction with preserved basal function and moderate-to-severe dysfunction in the midventricle and apical regions. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 | Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a hyper-enhancement confined to the lateral wall. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】The pathogenesis of the TCM is still obscure. Catecholamine-mediated cardiotoxicity provoked by emotional or physical stress, multivessel coronary vasospasm and abnormalities in coronary microvascular function have been proposed as explanations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 7\\]</u>. Higher admission levels of plasma catecholamine in patients with TCM compared to patients with Killip class III myocardial infarction described by Wittstein and colleagues support that exaggeration of sympathetic stimulation is central to the cause of this syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 7\\]</u>. In addition, Takotsubo-like LV dysfunction was seen in patients with pheochromocytoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In the present case the patient did not report about emotional stress preceding chest pain. Unfortunately plasma levels of catecholamines were not measured in this case. However, STEMI is frequently associated with emotional stress. TCM affects, like in the present case report, predominantly postmenopausal women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The estrogen deficiency seems to play a major role in this syndrome. Due to the clinical symptoms which include chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, and elevated myocardial markers, TCM is frequently mimicking ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the absence of a significant coronary artery disease. Otherwise it has been reported that an acute occlusion of a large “wrap-around” LAD, extending to the inferior wall, can produce a typical Takotsubo contraction pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Chao and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> reported that the Takotsubo contraction pattern was found in a significant percentage of patients with acute LAD occlusion and an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In this setting it has to be considered that angiography detects only atherosclerotic plaques that encroach on the lumen and may not detect lipid-rich plaques that have undergone positive remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Such plaques may not be detected on angiogram but carry the potential for transient clot formation and spasm. Therefore, LV stunning due to transient occlusion of the LAD as a part of the usual atherosclerotic process has to be considered as a reason for Takotsubo like LV dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The subtotal occlusion of the circumflex artery explains only lateral and may be inferior wall motion abnormalities. However, the subtotal occlusion of the circumflex artery does not explain the severe dysfunction in the apical regions. In addition LV stunning would only be expected in the territory of the circumflex coronary artery (infarct vessel). Moreover the wall motion abnormalities in the apical regions disappeared after 11 days. Only an impaired lateral contractility (territory of the circumflex coronary artery/infarct vessel) could still be observed. In addition, only an isolated hyper-enhancement confined to the lateral wall (territory of the circumflex coronary artery/infarct vessel) was displayed on the MRI. Thus, transient clot formations in the LAD or in the right coronary artery were unlikely. Therefore, in the present case TCM was most likely triggered by an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of STEMI associated with TCM.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It involves the right ovarian vein in 70–80% of cases. The risk factors for the development of OVT are pregnancy or puerperium, hormone therapy with estrogen, recent surgery or hospitalization, malignancy, pelvic inflammatory diseases, thrombophilia and idiopathic OVT. We present a rare case of left OVT in a young, non-pregnant woman in her 30 s. A high degree of suspicion is necessitated in patients with the triad of young-middle-aged female, pain abdomen in lower quadrant and hematuria to diagnose OVT. Contrast enhanced computer tomography (CT-venography) is the diagnostic modality of choice. The patient was initially treated with low molecular weight heparin and then switched to direct oral anticoagulants. At 6-monthsfollow-up the patient was free from any symptoms.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】With 70–80% of the ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) involving the right ovarian vein (OV), thrombosis of the left OV is a yet rare thromboembolic condition with unknown incidence in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The postpartum (usually 2–6 days postpartum) or septic puerperal ovarian vein thrombosis has an incidence of 1 : 600–6000, in combination of caesarean births. In the case of a septic course, it can be life-threatening. Out of the multiple risk factors, thrombophilia is reported in up-to 24% of patients in various case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>. We portray a case of isolated left ovarian vein thrombosis presenting with abdominal pain in left lower quadrant (LQ).\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A young woman in her 30 s presented in the emergency room with abdominal pain in the left LQ for two weeks. The pain was shooting in character, with increasing intensity (7 of 10 on numeric pain scale) and radiation in the left flank. Clinical examination revealed mild tenderness and a palpable cord in the left LQ. A urine analysis showed isolated mild microscopic hematuria without any urological or gynecological disorders. A urine-HCG pregnancy test was negative. Blood examination was unremarkable apart from an increase of c-reactive protein to 1.69 mg/dl. After an inconclusive ultrasound and X-ray of the abdomen, a contrast (i.v.) abdominal CT was performed and revealed thrombosis of the left OV with dilated and tortuous adnexal veins . The thrombus extended centrally, but the confluence with the left renal vein was entirely patent. The patient had three complication-free pregnancies in the past and was on estrogen contraceptive pills. No other risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were reported. She was admitted for monitoring and analgesia. The patient was anticoagulated with Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily and i.v analgesia with 1 g 8-hourly metamizole was administered. Estrogen contraceptives (combination of 0.1 mg levonorgestrel and 0.02 mg ethinylestradiol) were withheld and she was advised to switch over to alternative methods of contraception, as no future pregnancies were planned. Further thrombophilia testing revealed APC resistance and heterozygote mutation of factor V mutation and factor II-20210A . A COVID-19 PCR test was negative. The patient was discharged well the next day, and anticoagulation was switched to apixaban 10 mg twice daily for one week, followed by dose reduction to 5 mg twice daily. At six months follow-up, she was free of any symptoms, and further venous CT was regarded superfluous. The patient was advised to continue the anticoagulation for another 4 weeks.

Discussion\n\n【9】Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare type of thromboembolism, frequently involving the right ovarian vein (70–80%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Various retrospective case series studies report diverse risk factors associated with OVT. The common risk factors being pregnancy or puerperium in 9–81% patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–10\\]</u>, hormone therapy with estrogen (in 6–18%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 10\\]</u>, recent surgery (in 23–100%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5, 7–10\\]</u>, and malignancy (in 1–100%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–10\\]</u>. Other risk factors are recent hospitalization, pelvic inflammatory diseases, thrombophilia, and idiopathic OVT. Thrombophilia in absence of other risk factors is a rare cause of OVT. In retrospective series of 223 patients reported by Assal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, thrombophilia could be excluded in all the patients. On the contrary, Lenz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and Rottenstreich et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported thrombophilia in 14% and 24% patients, respectively.\n\n【10】The most common presenting symptom in patients with OVT is LQ abdominal pain usually on the affected side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Pain radiation to the flank, upper abdomen and or groin is not uncommon. A cord like structure in the LQ is palpable in <50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A high degree of suspicion is necessitated in patients with the triad of young-middle-aged female, pain in LQ, and hematuria to diagnose OVT. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen is the first line imaging modality and offers the advantages of being safe, easily available and helps rule out other abdominal pathologies. Contrast enhanced CT or CT venography offers sensitivity up to 100% and specificity up to 99% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Because of ionizing radiations and risk of contrast induced nephropathy, CECT is disadvantageous in pregnant patients and patients with renal insufficiency respectively. The typical findings in a CECT are filling defects in the ovarian vein with dilated or tortuous veins as seen in Figure 1. MR venography has the benefit of being free from ionizing radiations and safe in pregnant patients but involves higher costs and is unavailable in emergency setting. After excluding other causes of OVT, thrombophilia testing should be initiated.\n\n【11】The diagnosis of OVT in the above-mentioned patient was achieved by CECT and thrombophilia testing, revealed APC resistance and heterozygote mutation of factor V mutation and factor II-20210A. This patient had multiple risk factors such as smoking, estrogen pills, and thrombophilia. The authors recommend thrombophilia testing for further evaluation of patient with pain abdomen of unclear etiology and OVT.\n\n【12】The treatment of OVT not associated with pregnancy or sepsis is predominantly based on anticoagulation. Antibiotics play a role only in case of concomitant infection for, e.g. in puerperal sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Rottenstreich et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a significant inclination towards using antibiotics in pregnancy related OVT as compared to nonpregnancy-related OVT (60 vs 21.4% ). The use of anticoagulation is based on the principles of the usual management of venous thromboembolism and initiated with either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (therapeutic dose 1 mg/kg twice daily) or unfractionated heparin. The anticoagulation is subsequently bridged to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), which have been the standard oral anticoagulants for the past decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The recent introduction of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and their use in deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has led to their use in OVT as well. Cook et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> administered 15 mg twice daily rivaroxaban, followed by 20 mg once daily indefinitely in patients with OVT with thrombophilia (factor V mutation homozygosity) and on oral contraceptive pills. Naoum et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> treated pregnancy-associated OVT with tinzaparin for a week and then rivaroxaban 20 mg for 6 months.\n\n【13】The duration of anticoagulation in OVT remains controversial and should be based in the etiology and individual patient-associated factors. Rottenstreich et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a longer treatment duration in patients with nonpregnancy OVT as compared to pregnancy-associated OVT (6 vs 3 months, p = 0.1). Lenz et al. reported VTE reoccurrence rates of 6% at 1-year and 14.3% at 5-yearsfollow-up in OVT patients. Labropoulus et al. reported 17.4% recurrent CTE during a median follow-up of 2.3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Based on the above facts, the authors suggest treating thrombophilia-induced OVT with anticoagulation beginning with LMWH and continuing with oral anticoagulants for lifetime. The decision of lifelong anticoagulation should be based on the etiology of OVT and individual risk profile. The aforesaid patient was administered 1 mg/kg enoxaparin daily for 1 week and then switched to direct oral anticoagulant apixaban, which was prescribed for lifetime. The patients should be reevaluated regularly for, e.g. after 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Another therapy option of catheter directed thrombolysis carries high risk of bleeding and is rarely required and reserved for patients with heavy thrombus progression under anticoagulation therapy or if both kidney veins are involved.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【16】Even though a rare entity, a high degree of suspicion is necessitated in patients with the triad of young middle-aged female, pain in LQ, and hematuria to diagnose OVT. After ruling out the predisposing factors, testing for thrombophilia is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Anticoagulation should be commenced with low molecular weight heparin. Switching to DOAKs is possible. Evidence on duration of anticoagulation is lacking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and should be based on patients’ condition, symptoms, and risk factors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a bony avulsion injury, which was presumed to have arisen from the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament but turned out instead to be an osteochondral avulsion fracture of the femoral origin. This unexpected finding that was not detected during preoperative workup resulted in the first attempt at surgical fixation being aborted. The need for a second planned definitive fixation procedure emphasises the importance of combining a thorough history and examination in association with appropriate imaging in the patient workup. The patient’s definitive operative treatment and outcome are described. Although rare, surgeons (and emergency room doctors) treating such patients should include femoral end avulsion injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament in the differential diagnosis of a child presenting with an acute haemarthrosis of the knee. Furthermore, once diagnosed, early onward referral to an experienced knee surgeon is advocated.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In the skeletally immature because ligamentous structures are stronger than their osseous attachments, intrasubstance ligament injuries are rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>; therefore, in the context of the paediatric knee, injuries that stress the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) usually result in chondral or osteochondral avulsion fracture, characteristically from the tibial attachment of the ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, resulting in a tibial spine avulsion fracture. By comparison, avulsions of the ACL from the femoral origin are rare, and to date only nine other cases of femoral end avulsion injuries of the ACL have been reported in the English-speaking literature. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a femoral ended osteochondral avulsion injury of the ACL. Despite their rare occurrence, femoral end avulsions of the ACL should be included in the differential diagnosis of a child with an acute haemarthrosis of the knee.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 11-year-old male patient presented to our institution after sustaining trauma to his left lower extremity. On the day of presentation, there had been high winds in the vicinity resulting in the corrugated iron roof of a garage he had been walking nearby blowing off and landing on his left leg. The patient was trapped under the sheet of metal until freed by attending paramedics. In the emergency department, primary and secondary survey assessments of the patient revealed injuries to the knee and distal fibula only. A full formal examination of the knee was not possible due to pain and a tense haemarthrosis. Subsequent plain radiographs revealed an intra-articular avulsion fracture , as well as fracture of the distal fibular diaphysis. A working diagnosis of displaced tibial spine avulsion fracture was made, and the patient was scheduled for surgery the following day to assess and fix the injury. Examination under anaesthesia revealed a ten-degree block to neutral extension of the knee and a positive Lachmann test with a soft end point. Arthroscopic examination of the knee revealed a lesion at odds with the preoperative diagnosis of tibial spine avulsion. A femoral end osteo-chondral avulsion fracture of the ACL was revealed . Due to the unexpected findings and uncertainty about the optimal method of fixation in a skeletally immature patient, the fragment was reduced back into its normal position, the arthroscopic portals were closed, and the knee was splinted in extension in a plaster of Paris splint. With the benefit of hindsight, the treating team acknowledged that if a bone fragment this large had been avulsed from the tibial insertion of the ACL, this should have been reflected in the architecture of the tibial spine footprint on the preoperative X-ray. But as the appearances of this region appeared normal, this avulsion was unlikely to have occurred from the tibial end of the ACL, rather occurring from the less common femoral origin. A CT scan was subsequently obtained , and the literature was scrutinised to aid preoperative planning of definitive fixation. Subsequent definitive fixation was perfomed nine days following the index procedure using a part arthroscopic and part open approach. Initial arthroscopic manoeuvres (including the use of a direct anterior portal in addition to the two standard portals) involved gentle curettage of the residual crater over the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle from where the ACL had been avulsed. Then two 2.4 mm Beath pins were passed in transosseous manner from the lateral supracondylar ridge into the centre of the defect (crossing the physis) using a posterior cruciate ligament targeting guide. 2 loops of 1 PDS suture were passed via these tunnels from the outside of the knee to the centre of the defect. Then a medial parapatellar approach to the knee joint was performed to formally expose the knee, two No. 2 Vicryl Bunnell sutures were passed across the femoral end of the ACL, and these sutures were placed into the PDS loops that had previously been passed into the knee. Pulling on the PDS sutures allowed the No. 2 Vicryl sutures to be passed through the tunnels previously drilled with the Beath pins and to be delivered to the lateral supracondylar ridge of the femur. The sutures were then tied to one another over a bone bridge thereby reducing the avulsed fragment back into its normal anatomical position . Postoperatively, the patient was splinted in extension for the first four weeks. At this stage, the patient was placed into a range of motion knee brace (allowing up to sixty degrees of flexion) and allowed to partially weight bear with crutches. At six weeks following surgery, the patient’s brace was slackened to allow a full range of motion. Radiographs performed nine weeks following definitive fixation showed union of his fracture . He was allowed to ambulate free of his brace at this stage. At six-month follow up, the patient was able to ambulate without walking aids with a normal gait pattern and had a negative anterior drawer and Lachmann test and full restoration of knee flexion.

The youngest patient to have sustained such an injury was three years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The last two of these reports differed in their length of follow up with the latter reporting good outcome at 13-year follow up (as opposed to 10 weeks in the former report) with only slight laxity of the ACL. Almost universally these injuries occur as a result of relatively high-energy mechanisms as was the case with our patient.\n\n【13】Robinson and Driscoll 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> were the first group to report such an injury where it was seen in conjunction with a simultaneous avulsion of the tibial end of the ligament as well. The first report of an isolated avulsion of the femoral origin of the ACL was reported by Eady et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Tohyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a case of consecutive avulsion fractures involving the ACL in which a tibial-sided avulsion fracture was successfully treated and was followed 35 months later by a second injury in which the femoral attachment of the ACL was avulsed.\n\n【14】Our technique of repair was in essence similar to that described by Robinson and Driscoll 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> with our transosseous tunnels for passage of the sutures attached to the femoral end of the ACL crossing the physis.

The technically demanding nature of this method of fixation mandates that surgery be performed by soft tissue knee surgeons with expertise in the treatment of ACL injuries in the skeletally immature.\n\n【15】In summary, the case presented in this paper illustrates the pitfalls that may be encountered when treating children presenting with acute injuries to the knee.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Meckel’s diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the intestine, with an incidence of 2~4%. Of those, only 2% of patients with MD are symptomatic. Torsion of MD is extremely rare, and only a dozen cases have been previously reported. Case Report. The patient was a 49-year-old male who presented to our emergency room with a chief complaint of lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography imaging revealed an irregular polycystic mass connected to the small intestine that measured 7.5 cm in a diameter. A laparoscopic-assisted partial resection of the jejunum was performed. The lesion was found to have caused torsion and was located 130 cm from the ileocecal valve. The specimen was polycystic in appearance and showed communicating links with the submucosal layer of jejunum but not with the lumen. The pathological diagnosis was a torsion of an atypical presentation of MD. Conclusion. This case was different from typical cases of MD in that it was located on significantly oral side and had the appearance of polycystic morphology.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Meckel’s diverticulum (MD) is vestigial remnant of the vitelline duct and results from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>, the most common congenital anomaly of the intestine, with an incidence of 2~4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. By the 5th to 7th week of gestation, the yolk sac has been reduced to a slim stalk, as the vitelline duct. Incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct results in MD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Typical MD contains all the layers of intestine, because the yolk sac is continuous with the embryo and contains all the layers of intestinal wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Most cases of MD are asymptomatic, and only 4~16% of patients with MD become symptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 4\\]</u>. The size of the diverticulum is associated with the complication rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, and a variety of complications have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Of these, torsion of MD is an extremely rare clinical condition. Here, we report an extremely rare case of an atypical MD that macroscopically mimicked the extraintestinal growth of a small intestinal tumour and was treated by laparoscopic-assisted surgery.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient was a 49-year-old male who presented to our emergency department with the complaint of a 4-day duration of lower abdominal pain. A physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation of the lower abdomen without signs of peritoneal irritation. There was no previous history of comorbid medical or surgical illness except for a recurrent feeling of abdominal discomfort that had persisted for several years. Laboratory data showed slight leukocytosis (WBC 112 × 10<sup>2</sup>/μL) with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP 30.67 mg/dl).\n\n【6】A computed tomography (CT) image revealed an irregular polycystic mass that was connected to the small intestine and measured 7.5 cm in diameter in the lower abdomen . The preoperative diagnosis was either a massive Meckel’s diverticulum or a small intestinal tumour. We planned to perform laparoscopic-assisted surgery. During the laparoscopy, the lesion was found to have caused torsion and congested. After dividing the inflammatory adhesions, the lesion was removed through the umbilical incision . We confirmed that the lesion was located 130 cm from the ileocecal valve and 50 cm from the ligament of Treitz. Partial resection of the jejunum, which included the lesion, was performed. The specimen was a solid irregular mass that looked like an extraintestinal growth tumour with a narrow neck . Macroscopically, an irregular polycystic appearance was observed on the cut surface, and the mass was fluid-containing. One of the cysts showed fistulation with the submucosal layer of small intestine; however, communicating links with the lumen were not apparent . Microscopically, the inner surfaces of the cysts were covered with layers of epithelium. One of the cysts exhibited the epithelium of the gastric pyloric gland, while another cyst adjacent to the intestine exhibited the epithelium of the small intestine 删除1:<u>(Figures 6(a) and 6(b))</u>. The lesion was diagnosed as atypical MD with torsion. The postoperative course of treatment was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the 11th postoperative day without postoperative complications.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 A computed tomography (CT) image revealed irregular polycystic mass connected to small intestine measuring 7.5 cm in a diameter in the lower abdomen.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 The lesion was found to cause torsion and congested.</u>\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 Partial jejunum resection including the lesion was performed.

Discussion</u>\n\n【16】In this report, we present an extremely rare case of atypical MD with torsion. This case differs from typical MD in that it was located significantly on oral side and had an atypical morphological appearance. First, regarding the location, the lesion in this case was located 130 cm from ileocecal valve and was 50 cm from the ligament of Treitz. Generally, MD is located on the antimesenteric border of the intestine and is usually found within 100 cm of the ileocecal valve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. However, MD has been reported up to 180 cm from the ileocecal valve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Therefore, the lesion in this case was located significantly on oral side compared with typical MD.\n\n【17】Second, in terms of morphology, this case looked like an extraintestinal growth tumour with a narrow neck. This was apparently different from typical MD. The present case showed an absence of communicating links with the lumen of the adjacent bowel and an irregular polycystic appearance. These finding are not seen in typical MD. Previously, several cases have been reported to be diagnosed with MD without communication links with the adjacent lumen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–11\\]</u>. One hypothesis of this disruption is that the links of communication had been obliterated as a result of a developmental or an inflammatory process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In the present, case, the polycystic appearance might have also been caused by obliteration of the consecutive lumen as a result of a developmental process or chronic inflammation. Pathologically, the present case showed ectopic gastric mucosa, which is consistent with the diagnosis of MD. In MD, heterotopic tissues such as gastric mucosa, duodenal mucosa, jejunal mucosa, and pancreatic tissue are present in 30 to 65% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Of these, more than 60% are gastric mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Regarding the differential diagnosis, we had to rule out intestinal duplication. In the present case, an antimesenteric location is grounds for exclusion of intestinal duplication.\n\n【19】Generally, most cases of MD are asymptomatic, and only 4~16% of patients with MD become symptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 4\\]</u>. Symptoms include gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, diverticulitis, intussusception, and perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4\\]</u>. By contrast, torsion of MD is extremely rare, and only a dozen cases have been previously reported in the English-language literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–20\\]</u> . Diverticular length and base diameter are important factors associated with torsion. An elongated variant with a narrow neck, like the lesion seen in the present case, may be a risk factor for torsion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 17\\]</u>. In the present case, the patient had recurrent feelings of abdominal discomfort that had persisted for several years. This history suggested that recurrent torsion of the lesion had been occurring throughout that period. Chronic inflammation caused by recurrent torsion might result in a characteristic morphology that includes a polycystic appearance.\n\n【20】Table 1 Previous reports of Meckel’s diverticulum torsion in English literature.\n\n【21】Regarding treatment, surgical resection is the standard treatment for symptomatic MD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. In the present case, we performed laparoscopic-assisted surgery. Recent reports have suggested that laparoscopic-assisted surgery, including single incision laparoscopic-assisted surgery (SILS), is feasible for patients with symptomatic MD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21–23\\]</u>. In the present case, we did not attempt SILS because the lesion was of considerable size and we could not preoperatively rule out the possibility of a small intestinal tumour. However, we believe that SILS is a feasible procedure for typical cases of symptomatic MD, including MD with torsion, but only if the preoperative diagnosis of MD was made and if the lesion was relatively small enough to pass through the umbilical incision. To our knowledge, no cases of MD with torsion treated by laparoscopic-assisted surgery have previously been reported.\n\n【22】#### 4\\.

Our patient presented with a red, tortuous migratory rash with localized pruritus on the left plantar foot of 1-month duration. He lacked recent travel history outside the southeastern United States. Upon admission, he presented with peripheral blood eosinophilia, an uncommon feature of HrCLM. A single dose of ivermectin was sufficient for treatment, and symptoms resolved within 3 days. This case highlights the increased incidence of domestically acquired hookworm infections, explores this epidemiological shift, and emphasizes relevant differential diagnoses.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】An estimated 500 million individuals in developing tropical and subtropical countries are infected with hookworms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Unlike the human hookworms, the dog hookworm, Ancylostoma braziliense, and cat hookworm, A. caninum, do not intentionally target humans. However, they can incidentally infect humans percutaneously, and this zoonotic parasitic infestation results in hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. HrCLM classically presents as an erythematous, slightly raised, serpiginous or linear skin lesion that migrates within the epidermis. The phenomenon is known as a “creeping eruption” or “creeping dermatitis” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】A. braziliense and A. caninum reside in the gastrointestinal tracts of dogs and cats. Their eggs are expelled in animal feces and deposited in the soil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The consequent infective larvae can penetrate the corneal layer of the epidermis on any areas of exposed human skin that come into contact with contaminated soil. This typically occurs through the soles of individuals walking barefoot outside. Common sources of infection include beaches, sandboxes, and crawl spaces under dwellings, but any soil that may come in contact with animal droppings can be a potential reservoir 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The larvae produce hyaluronidase and a protease that allows their intradermal passage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. They cannot further develop in their incidental human host and are stuck migrating aimlessly within the epidermis until the larvae die. Consequently, HrCLM is innately self-limiting and resolves in as little as a few weeks to as long as a year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】HrCLM is one of the most common infectious diseases of international travelers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Historically, it has been attributed to travel to tropical and subtropical developing countries of Asia, Africa, and the Americas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, A. braziliense and A. caninum are also endemic to the southeastern United States, notably along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The increasing incidence of these infections in the southern United States may be a result of recent climate change, as these parasites thrive in warm, sandy conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. As cases of local soil transmission of hookworms rise, it is imperative that clinicians in the West be alert to identifying and differentiating this zoonotic parasite from other conditions with similar presentations, such as Löffler syndrome and DRESS syndrome, that bear considerably greater morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A well-appearing male in his twenties with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department initially for an erythematous rash that tracked proximally up his left arm, as well as left arm numbness and paraesthesias, following trauma to his left hand 2 weeks prior. He was admitted to the hospital for possible cellulitis with acute lymphangitic spread.\n\n【8】During admission, the patient noted a second rash on the medial aspect of his left plantar foot that had appeared 1-month prior. The erythematous lesion was serpiginous, intensely pruritic, and frequently changed locations overnight. He tried topical antibiotic ointment and hydrogen peroxide on the area without improvement.\n\n【9】The patient lived at home with his dogs and stray cats. He was a roofer by trade and frequently came into contact with sand and soil while working with construction materials. He wore “flip-flops” sandals on occasion but denied walking outside barefoot. He also denied going to the beach, local water springs, or any recent travel. The patient did not endorse any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, headaches, or changes in vision. He was uncertain of the last Tdap immunization and reported no IV drug use.\n\n【10】On examination, multiple traumatic lesions with pustules and bullae were present on his hands bilaterally. The left hand displayed a large blood-filled blister on the medial wrist with surrounding erythema that radiated proximally toward his left arm. His left plantar foot exhibited an erythematous tortuous lesion with a migrating track adjacent to an approximately 4 cm patch of erythema with a central scab and bullae . All the other examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 The site of the injury on the plantar surface of the foot displaying linear open bullae, serpiginous rash, and surrounding erythema.</u>\n\n【12】On the day of admission, laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cells (15.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L; reference range 4.0–10 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), C-reactive protein (22.69 mg/dL; reference range 0–5 mg/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (32 mm/hour; reference range 0–10 mm/hour). His overall eosinophil count was within normal limits (0.14 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L; reference range 0.03–0.46 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), but his eosinophils occupied a high proportion of total white cells (15%). No skin biopsy, stool testing, or chest X-ray was performed.\n\n【13】##### 2.1. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【14】The differential diagnosis of a man in his late twenties presenting with a 1-month history of a migratory serpiginous rash with associated pruritus includes HrCLM, larva currens of strongyloidiasis, gnathostomiasis, and scabies.\n\n【15】The rash of HrCLM is red, well-defined, persistent, and slowly migrates at a rate of 1–2 cm/day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. When suspecting a HrCLM, the main condition that must be ruled out is larva currens, the migrating rash of the human nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. In comparison to HrCLM, the rash of larva currens is pink, less defined, evanescent, and rapidly migrates at a rate of 5–15 cm/hour. The lower trunk, buttocks, and thighs are commonly affected. Larva currens also presents with marked urticaria, systemic symptoms, GI manifestations, peripheral eosinophilia, and stool positive for larvae of S. stercoralis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Gnathostomiasis is caused by the larvae of Gnathostoma spp. migrating through subcutaneous tissues. It can present as a creeping eruption with intermittent, migratory swellings of the trunk and upper extremities. However, gnathostomiasis is a food-borne parasite that often follows ingestion of raw or contaminated seafood or travel to endemic countries of Southeast Asia, Central, or South America 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Scabies represents the cutaneous manifestation of a Sarcoptes scabiei mite infection. Scabies presents as intensely pruritic linear or serpiginous burrows in multiple areas, commonly the interdigital spaces of the hand, wrists, intertriginous areas, and genitalia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【18】##### 2.2. Treatment and Outcome\n\n【19】Our patient was diagnosed with hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM) and treated with a single dose of ivermectin 200 μg/kg.\n\n【20】The left-hand clinical picture of trauma and erythema quickly streaking up the left arm combined with a white blood cell count of 15.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L prompted a clinical suspicion of cellulitis with acute lymphangitic spread. The patient completed antibiotics and received a Tdap vaccine booster.\n\n【21】The patient’s creeping dermatitis and pruritus of the left plantar foot resolved within 3 days. At that time, he was discharged to go home.\n\n【22】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【23】Our case demonstrates a classic presentation of HrCLM acquired domestically in the southeastern United States. As our patient lacked recent travel history, he was likely exposed while wearing flip flops on the ground around his home that had been soiled by his dogs and cats. Alternatively, since he worked in roofing, he may have been exposed to contaminated soil while handling building materials on the job. Traditionally, HrCLM has been associated with travel to sandy beaches that are contaminated with the filariform larvae of animal feces. Indigenous cases of HrCLM in patients without a history of travel have been increasingly reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Much attention has been given to the effects of global warming on the incidence of human helminth infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Warmer climates and increased rainfall increase the tropical and subtropical zones on the global map and foster ideal conditions for the life cycle of A. braziliense and A. caninum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Therefore, climate change may be contributing to an increased incidence of domestically acquired animal hookworm infections and should be a continued area of interest for researchers.\n\n【24】The diagnosis was made clinically. No skin biopsy or stool testing was performed. Skin biopsies are rarely diagnostic of HrCLM since the larvae are typically located 1–2 cm ahead of the visible lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In our case, the classical clinical picture strongly suggested the diagnosis of HrCLM without the need for further testing. However, in cases with less clear clinical pictures, testing for S. stercoralis antibodies and larvae in stool would be helpful to rule out the diagnosis of larva currens of strongyloidiasis.\n\n【25】Our patient is notable in that he presented with peripheral eosinophilia of 15%. In a study of 98 German travelers with HrCLM, 20% of the 40 individuals tested presented with eosinophilia >7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. While our patient presented with peripheral eosinophilia, he did not report any respiratory symptoms or display any signs of pulmonary distress, so a chest X-ray was not performed. However, HrCLM can present in a self-limited disseminated form called Löffler syndrome (pulmonary eosinophilia), characterized by an immediate onset of peripheral eosinophilia, transient pulmonary infiltrates, and respiratory symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Löffler syndrome can be seen following infection by hookworms as well as Ascaris lumbricoides and S. stercoralis. In cases of Löffler syndrome, the differential diagnosis must include drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome with pulmonary manifestation, as these two conditions can present identically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. While Löffler syndrome is mild and self-limited, DRESS syndrome is severe and potentially fatal. DRESS syndrome is a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs 2–8 weeks after drug exposure (often allopurinol, anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, dapsone, and other antimicrobials) with a variable clinical presentation that can include high fever, malaise, skin eruption, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, and visceral organ involvement (commonly liver, kidney, and lungs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The skin rash is often the first clear manifestation of DRESS syndrome and often presents as a symmetric maculopapular rash involving >50% of the trunk and extremities that later coalesces with erythema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Mucosal involvement, pruritus, and facial edema may also occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Pulmonary involvement is rare but signifies a greater severity of the disease. When pulmonary involvement does occur, it most commonly presents with cough, shortness of breath, and interstitial infiltrates on imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Due to its nonspecific presentation, DRESS is referred to as a “great mimicker” and is a diagnosis of exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. With a mortality rate of 10%, DRESS syndrome is an important differential diagnosis to consider in any patient presenting with a rash 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Although HrCLM is self-limiting, pharmacological treatment of choice includes oral ivermectin 200 μg/kg once daily for 1–2 days or oral albendazole 400–800 mg once daily with a fatty meal for 3 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A similar case of HrCLM acquired in Florida was successfully treated with two doses of ivermectin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However, a single dose of oral ivermectin is sufficient for patients with HrCLM with creeping dermatitis, as in the case of our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Ivermectin acts on ligand-gated chloride channels in nematodes to induce paralysis and impede feeding and fertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Inconsistent results have been reported in patients treated with topical ivermectin 1% cream twice daily for two weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 21, 22\\]</u>. Interestingly, a recent report observed eradication of HrCLM in a patient treated with a low-dose ivermectin 0.1% cream twice daily for two weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Additionally, topical thiabendazole 10–15% ointments and albendazole may provide an alternative, albeit less potent, treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【28】In summary, HrCLM is a clinical diagnosis classically associated with international travel to tropical areas. However, cases of indigenous HrCLM are increasingly reported. This change in epidemiology may be partially attributed to changes in climate that have shifted the tropical landscape. Therefore, clinicians must keep this diagnosis as well as other similar clinical presentations in mind. If diagnosed promptly, this skin disease responds very well to pharmacological therapy, and often a single dose of ivermectin adequately resolves the infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This is a report of a 51-year-old Japanese man with venous leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein. The tumor was found during a medical examination, and the patient had no symptoms. Computed tomography showed a 72 × 49 mm mass adjacent to the left external iliac vein. The tumor was resected en-block along with ligation of the external iliac vein due to strong adhesion with the tumor. Histological examination showed venous leiomyosarcoma, and its origin was thought to be a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein. The patient has remained free from recurrence at 30 months after surgery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Venous leiomyosarcomas commonly arise from the inferior vena cava, pulmonary vein, femoral vein, great saphenous vein, and jugular vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A venous leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein is rare, and this may be the first report of this finding. Generally, the prognosis of leiomyosarcoma is poor. Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy can be performed to improve the prognosis, but their efficacy remains debatable. Only complete resection of the tumor is necessary for long-term survival. In the present case, there has been no evidence of recurrence at 30 months after complete surgical resection along with ligation of the left external iliac vein.\n\n【4】#### 2\\.

Laboratory findings, including serum concentrations of oncological markers such as alpha fetoprotein, cancer antigen 19–9, neuron-specific enolase, and carcinoembryonic antigen, were within the normal range.

However, the patient was engaged in physical labor and did not want to take an anticoagulant after surgery. So, we finally decided to perform combined resection of the left iliac vein with the tumor. Extirpation of the tumor was performed. We could easily peel the tumor from surrounding tissue except at the left external iliac vein where, as predicted, the tumor was strongly adhered. Therefore, complete tumor resection was achieved by combined resection of the external iliac vein.\n\n【8】Pathological examination revealed a gross, well-defined, firm tumor of 60-mm at the greatest diameter. The cut surface was gray-white with a whorled appearance. Microscopically, the tumor was mostly composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with a mild to moderate degree of cellular pleomorphism and was considered to be a low-grade leiomyosarcoma. Furthermore, there were focal areas of high cellularity and bizarre nuclei 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. Immunostaining for α\\-SMA 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u> was positive, and that for S-100, c-kit, and DOG-1 were negative. The positive ratio of MIB-1 was low at 5–10% 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u>. Contrary to expectation, the tumor was separated from external iliac vein, where only fibrous adhesions without infiltration were present 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u>.

However, the tunica media and tunica externa of this vascular wall were diminished and completely replaced by tumor cells 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(c) and 3(d))</u>.

However, the painful swelling of his left thigh improved one week later and ultimately disappeared by about 3 months after surgery. The patient has remained free from recurrence at 30 months after surgery.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Vascular leiomyosarcomas usually arise from a vein, approximately 5 times more often than from an artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. A preference for the female sex has been reported: 82.6% of all patients are female, and leiomyosarcomas usually appear around 50–60 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Primary venous leiomyosarcomas arise from vascular smooth muscle cells, and the growth pattern may progress from intramural to endoluminal, extraluminal, or mixed forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. The endoluminal pattern has a worse prognosis than the extraluminal pattern because of its high rate of metastasis.\n\n【14】Standard treatment for vascular leiomyosarcoma is surgical resection, and 40–60% of patients undergo surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Optimal treatments with chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not yet been established. When curative surgical resection is performed, the rates of 3- and 5-year survival are 76% and 33%, respectively. If a curative operation is not performed, the prognosis is bad 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, an aggressive surgical approach assuring a free en-bloc tumor resection can be curative despite a reported local recurrence rate of 53.7% in selected cases at an average of 25 months after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 9, 10\\]</u>. In our investigation, we found a few reports of leiomyosarcomas arising from the external iliac vein, but no report of leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of this vein. These reports showed that such leiomyosarcomas may have a relatively good prognosis. The reason for this may be that the tumor growth pattern likely progresses from intramural to extraluminal. When the tumor progresses endoluminally, symptoms such as leg pain, swelling, and leg numbness appear immediately due to constriction of the external iliac vein. For this reason, a leiomyosarcoma originating from the external iliac vein can be detected early and the patient can undergo a curative operation; thus, their prognosis is relatively good.\n\n【15】In most of the reports of vascular leiomyosarcomas originating from the external iliac vein, blood vessel reconstruction was performed. However, a recent report revealed that blood vessel reconstruction had a higher incidence of thrombosis while providing no additional benefit in reducing symptomatic extremity edema compared to ligation in patients with isolated external iliac vein injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Furthermore, patients who underwent blood vessel reconstruction must permanently take anticoagulants. We ligated the left external iliac vein in our patient immediately after surgery; although he suffered left leg pain and swelling, it had resolved by 3 months later. He does not take anticoagulants. Thus, ligation of the external iliac vein as curative surgery for vascular leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the external iliac vein may be one viable treatment option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of vascular graft infection due to Listeria monocytogenes as an example of a less well-known manifestation of listeriosis and focus on the possible treatment procedures emphasizing a management with surgical debridement but preservation of the endograft, in contrast to the gold standard treatment of vascular graft infections which consists of a removal of the graft.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The awareness of Listeria monocytogenes as a pathogen in meningitis in immunosuppressed or elderly patients is high. Also gastroenteritis, infections in pregnancy or sepsis in neonates are well-known clinical manifestations due to Listeria. However, this pathogen can cause many other types of infection. As an example, we report here the so-far 8th case of vascular graft infection due to Listeria, where in general organisms like Staphylococci, E. coli, or Streptococci are found. Our aim is to increase the awareness of Listeria as a pathogen causing other clinical syndromes in immunosuppressed patients over and above meningitis and gastroenteritis, and we focus on the treatment options in prosthetic graft infection due to Listeria reviewing the so far reported 7 cases.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 59-year-old man was referred to our hospital in August 2007 because of a progression of his chronic low back pain which began at the beginning of May 2007 accompanied by recurrent episodes of fever. The fever occured a few weeks later at the end of May 2007, and because of a temperature of 39°C the general practitioner treated the patient empirically with a 10-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanate. After that, the fever disappeared for a few weeks, but new episodes of fever and pain attacks occurred in July and August 2007. During this time, the C-reactive protein level was rising to 250 mg/l at admission (standard value <5 mg/l). The patient was under immunosuppression with Ciclosporine A and Mycophenolate-Mofetile after renal transplantation 2004, and he got an endovascular repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm with a Talent-graft in 2005. At admission, the patient’s low back pain and fluctuating fever were interpreted as a sacroileitis. A MRI-scan showed no skeletal pathology but a slight enhancement of the sclerotic infrarenal aorta including an enhancement of the periaortal tissue. So, a CT guided translumbar needle aspiration of the enhancing structure was taken, and the cultures yielded growth of Listeria monocytogenes, whereas the blood cultures remained negative. Therefore, the patient was treated with ampicillin 2 gm q4h intravenously without gentamicin because of his impaired renal function .\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Sagital view of preoperative MRI-scan showing a retroaortal fluid collection with slight enhancement reaching to the dorsal part of the prosthetic endograft. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【7】Under this antibiotic treatment, the CRP-level sank initially, but remained then around 120 mg/l so that gentamicin 1 mg/kg i.v. three times a day was added. At this time, the surgeon refused a surgical approach since the renal transplant was vasculated through the graft and a removal of the graft would have been a high risk for the transplanted organ. After 6 weeks of combined antibiotic therapy a new MRI showed new collections around the vascular graft down to the psoas muscle. A drainage delivered pure pus, the cultures were sterile but an in-house eubacterial PCR (16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis) was positive for Listeria. So after 2 months of conservative treatment a surgical approach was faced due to lacking improvement. Intraoperatively extensive inflammatory adhesions were found; therefore, the aneurysm with the endograft could not be removed. Only a debridement around the aneurysm and in the psoas muscle could be performed. The Mycophenolate-Mofetil dosing was reduced at that time. Two weeks thereafter and after 8 weeks of combined intravenous antibiotic therapy the patient could be discharged with an oral regimen consisting of 320 mg trimethoprim/1600 mg sulfamethoxazole twice a day. A MRI-scan 6 months later in June 2008 showed no more abscesses but a slight enhancement in the periaortic tissue as well as in the psoas muscle. In January 2009, the CRP achieved a normal level (<5 mg/l), and, in July 2009, there was no more enhancement in the MRI-scan. Nevertheless, we decided to continue the antibiotic treatment for another 2 years (until July 2011) since the patient has a stable function of his renal transplant and since a relapse of the graft infection would be disastrous for the whole situation of the patient. In March 2011, the patient is well without any symptoms.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】A prosthetic graft infection is a very rare (0.6% to 3%) but serious complication after aneurysm repair with a high mortality (25% to 88%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Although there are no guidelines, the gold standard in treatment consists of a complete excision of the graft, reconstruction of an extra-anatomic bypass, and an antibiotic treatment for several weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 11\\]</u>. Generally, organisms like Staphylococci or gramnegative enteric organisms as E. coli are responsible for prosthetic graft infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Graft infections due to Listeria are extremely rare. Including our case, only 8 cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. In general, Listeria monocytogenes is an uncommon cause of severe illness. Healthy hosts may develop self-limited febrile gastroenteritis, whereas patients with risk factors are prone for invasive disease. Risk factors are the extremes of age (neonates and elderly persons >60 years), pregnancy, and especially impaired cellular immunity as in organ transplant recipients or patients with hematologic malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. According to that, five of the eight vascular graft infections due to Listeria occurred in patients showing at least one of the reported risk factors like age (case no. 1, 6, 7) or immunosuppression (case no. 3, 8) . Our case is the only case of Listerial graft infection in a solid organ transplanted patient.\n\n【10】Table 1 Summary of the 8 so-far reported graft infections due to Listeria monocytogenes.\n\n【11】In the 8 analysed cases, with one exception, the mean interval between graft implantation and onset of infection was 2 years (range 12 weeks to 10 years), indicating a hematogeneous spread of infection. Listeria occur ubiquitous are mainly ingested with contaminated food, and invasive disease evolves by hematogeneous spread from the gut 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. 1–5% of healthy individuals are asymptomatic intestinal carriers of Listeria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This was presumably also the way our patient achieved the graft infection, but it was not possible to determine the source where he ingested Listeria. He did not report having eaten raw milk or soft cheese nor did he purchase food from delicatessen counters regularly. As a chemist, he did not have any risk by profession like, for example, farmers who are in direct contact to cattle which are possible carriers of Listeria as well. Only 5% of all cases of Listeriosis occur in outbreaks. In Switzerland, the last outbreak was in 2005 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> but in an area far from where the patient lived. Apart from his immunosuppression due to the renal transplantation, our patient did not have any further risk factors for Listeriosis as for example described by Fernàndez-Sebé et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> for solid-organ transplant recipients: no diabetes mellitus, no history of CMV-disease, or high-dose steroid therapy in the preceding 6 months. As reported by Stamm et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, Listeriosis in renal transplant recipients in particular occured in 75% during the first year after transplantation. In our case, the manifestation of the infection was 4 years after transplantation, but the moment of acquisition remains unclear.\n\n【12】The diagnosis of graft infections can be extremely challenging. Symptoms are often nonspecific like recurrent fever and chills or back pain as it was in our case. With a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 85% CT-scan is considered the diagnostic test of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>, but since it cannot distinguish sterile fluid from perigraft abscedation, PET/CT seems to be a promising method. Blood cultures are only positive in 21%, cultures of drain production or of the prosthesis itself in 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Considering the 8 reported cases with Listerial graft infections blood cultures were taken in only 5 of the 8 patients and were positive in three of the five. An aspirate of the perigraft fluid was taken in 6 of the cases, and all of the samples showed growth of listeria. This fact points out that culturing perigraft fluid seems to have a considerably higher sensitivity compared to the 50% reported by Saleem et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【13】With regard to the treatment strategy, persistence or recurrence of the infection was observed in both with (case no. 2) and without (cases no. 4–8) initial removal of the prosthesis , where at the gold standard of treatment consists of an early removal of the graft. Antibiotic therapy alone was initially tried in 6 of the 8 cases, but was successful in only two patients (cases no. 3, 4). In one case a percutaneous drainage was finally successful (no. 7), and in our case (no. 8), a surgical debridement without graft removal was successful in the end . So, we conclude and agree with Saleem et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u> that in patients with a high perioperative risk, a preservation of the endograft together with a prolonged and high-dose antimicrobial therapy combined with radiological drainage or surgical debridement but without graft removal is a possible treatment option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Echinococcus granulosus is the most common Echinococcus species affecting human. It may affect any organ and tissue in the body, most in the liver and lung. Disease is endemic in some regions of the world, and is common in Iran. Primary hydatid cyst of the axillary region is an unusual and rare localization of hydatid disease. So far, only sixteen cases have been published in the all medical literature. Case Report. Herein, we present a 33-year-old woman because of a mass in the axillary region of four months duration. Axillary ultrasonography showed a thick wall cystic lesion. No abnormality was found in mammographic examination of either breast, or in abdominal ultrasonography and chest X-ray. The mass was excised for pathological examination that showed a typical laminated membrane of hydatid cyst. Postoperative IgG- ELISA serology in this case was negative. Based on pathology an axillary hydatid cyst was diagnosed. Conclusion. Hydatid cyst should be considered in endemic areas in patients presenting with a soft tissue mass in the axillary region.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In human, three forms of echinococcosis are known to occur: cystic echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, alveolar echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, and polycystic Echinococcosis due to Echinococcus vogeli or Echinococcus oligarthrus. Hydatid disease is a parasitic disease usually caused by the larval stage of a small zoonotic tapeworm primarily found in dogs Echinococcus granulosus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Echinococcus granulosus (cystic echinococcosis) is the most common species, E. granulosus has worldwide distribution and is endemic in many countries, especially the Mediterranean region, Australia, South America, the Middle East, South Africa, and Eastern Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Iran is also an endemic area for hydatid diseases, the prevalence of cystic echinococcosis in humans detected by ultrasound ranges from less than 0.5% to 1.5%. Human seropositivity was greater than 5% in the west and southwest of the Islamic Republic of Iran, with 2–18% seroprevalence in nomadic groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. The hydatid cysts of E. granulosus tend to form in the liver (50% to 70% of patients) or lung (20% to 30%) but may through the capillary systems reaches the general circulation and passes to all viscera and soft tissues. For this reason, hydatid cysts may arise in atypical sites such as the brain, heart, orbit, urinary bladder, chest wall, subcutaneous tissue, tibia, parotid gland, breast, cervicofacial region, thyroid, and in any organ of the body (10%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 6, 7\\]</u>. The diagnostic methods include imaging techniques, mainly X-ray for lung echinococcosis, ultrasound and computed tomography examination for abdominal echinococcosis and other affected organs, and immunodiagnostic tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IFAT, and immunoblot) for confirmation. IgG-ELISA is about 90% sensitive for liver cyst infection but less sensitive for lung (80%) or other organ involvementand (90%), and its specificity is 90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Symptoms are often absent, and in many cases infection is detected only incidentally by imaging studies. Its symptoms depending on the host organ, location, its effect on adjacent structures, complications due to rupture, secondary infections, and immunological reactions caused by the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5\\]</u>. Primary axillary hydatid disease is rare even in the endemic regions, we could find only sixteen case reports in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6, 8–21\\]</u>. In this paper, we report a case of a primary hydatid disease which originated in the subcutaneous tissue in the right axillary region in a 36-year-old woman.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 33-year-old woman in 2010 was presented to our hospital with painless right axillar swelling of four-month duration. She had no history of breast mass, fever, other symptoms, or other mass, and also had no history of hydatid cyst. On physical examination, a firm to hard  cm mobile mass was noted in the right axilla. Laboratory investigations were done which revealed normal blood counts and biochemical result. Ultrasound showed a  cm thick wall cystic lesion comparable with type CE1 of WHO classification . No abnormality was found in mammographic examination of either breast. In this case it was difficult to differentiate a cyst with uncharacteristic imaging findings (type CE1 of WHO Classification based on ultrasound) from simple subcutaneous cyst, haematoma, necrotic tumor, or lymph node based on ultrasound. Under general anesthesia, the entire cyst was excised without rupture and sent for histopathological examination. On macroscopic examination, a unilocular cyst with a hard fibrotic wall was seen. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of a typical laminated membrane of hydatid cyst . The hydatid IgG-ELISA test in our case was negative. Radiographs of chest, spine, and long bones were done for evaluation of hydatid in organs and all were normal. Abdominal ultrasound examination was normal. The patient was discharged from the hospital with albendazole 400 mg twice a day for four weeks. During one-year followup, examinations since her surgery have shown no relapse of hydatidosis.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Ultrasound image of axillary cyst. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Section of cyst wall showing germinal epithelium and underlying laminated membrane (haematoxylin-eosin stain, magnification ×10). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Hydatid disease is a common clinical pathology in many parts of the world. The main species pathogenic for humans in Mediterranean and Southern European countries is Echinococcus granulosus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Hydatid cysts most often develop in the liver and lung. primary axillary hydatid disease is rare, as shown in Table 1, we could find only sixteen previous case reports in the medical literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6, 8–21\\]</u> .\n\n【11】Table 1 Reported cases of hydatid cysts of the axilla.\n\n【12】Hydatid cysts grow 5 to 10 cm in size within the first year and can survive for years or even decades. The cyst may be present for many years in the organ in which it is located with no clinical symptoms or signs, and sometimes it may exhibit clinical symptoms depending on the size and location of the cyst and the pressure of the growing cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. The sonographic and tomographic appearances of subcutaneous hydatid disease such as axillary hydatid cyst are similar to those in other organs. Hydatid cyst may be unilocular at earlier stages, whereas older cysts are usually multilocular. They may either be made up of daughter cysts or have a solid appearance made up of multiple septated cysts. However, hyperintense hydatid cysts in the axillary region can be misdiagnosed as a soft tissue tumor or lymphadenopathy. As Iran is an endemic area for hydatid disease, this should be in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with tissue masses including haematoma, abscess, sarcoma, lymphadenopathy, breast cancer, or metastatic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 18\\]</u>. Infection is suspected based on imaging studies (ultrasonography, CT, and MRI), and it may be confirmed by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot serology. Ultrasonography is an easy available, and affordable with high diagnostic sensitivity imaging test for screening of hydatid cyst in endemic areas and in family members based on WHO classification. The sonographic imaging in our case showed a simple cystic lesion comparable with type CE1 of WHO Classification and did not confirm a diagnosis of hydatid cyst; it is difficult to differentiate a cyst with uncharacteristic imaging findings from simple subcutaneous cyst, haematoma, necrotic tumor, or lymph node based on ultrasound. Immunodiagnostic tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IFAT, and immunoblot) are used for confirmation. IgG-ELISA is about 90% sensitive for liver cyst infection but less sensitive for lung (80%) and other organ involvement (90%), and its specificity is 90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Postoperative IgG-ELISA test in this case was negative. Abdominal ultrasonography and a plain chest radiography are mandatory to detect liver and lung involvement. Chest X-rays and imaging studies showed no other involvement in our patient. In routine practice, the accurate diagnosis in patient with soft tissue hydatidosis is frequently delayed until histopathologic examination after surgery. In this case, for accurate diagnosis, the entire cyst was excised.\n\n【13】Today, treatment options for CE (cystic echinococcosis) include surgery, PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration), and chemotherapy. Optimal treatment of hydatid cysts is surgical resection to remove the cyst. The main purpose of the surgery is to prevent the patient from complications such as compression of surrounding structures, infection or rupture of the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. Total cystectomy with fibrous adventitia which allows removal of all parasitic elements without spillage of the contents of the cyst, is curative treatment for soft tissue hydatidosis. We performed total cystectomy without rupture in spite of the anatomical distortion of the axillary region. Antiparasitic medication is widely used postoperatively and preoperatively for the purpose of cyst size reduction and to limit the risk of intraoperative dissemination of daughter cysts. All patients are treated with albendazole 10 mg/kg/day for at least two weeks preoperatively, and this is continued postoperatively for four weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. However, the experience with scolicidal agents such as albendazole (400 mg/kg) and praziquantel (50 mg/kg) or a combination of these drugs in the treatment of soft tissue hydatid disease is very limited and results of the medical treatment in the hydatidosis are unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. We gave the patient albendazole 400 mg twice a day for four weeks postoperatively.\n\n【14】In conclusion, hydatid disease is a widespread public health problem in developing countries especially in endemic regions; therefore, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a palpable mass in the axillary region.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In this case, post-COVID-19 ischemic stroke occurred in a relatively young patient without preexisting cerebrovascular risk factors which were rarely reported before. Case Presentation. A 40-year-old male presented lack of concentration, sluggish mind, and forgetfulness. The patient has a positive COVID-19 history 5 weeks ago. The noncontrast MSCT scan confirmed multifocal lacunar cerebral infarction on the left lateral ventricle. Laboratory tests showed an increase in D-dimer of 1.22 g/ml. Conclusion. In COVID-19 patients without comorbidities, ischemic stroke should be considered.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】COVID-19 caused by the COVID-19 virus is associated with multisystem dysfunction covering any neurologic involvement.

A stroke occurs mainly in patients with severe COVID-19 and who have preexisting vascular risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【5】COVID-19 patients have significantly higher rates of cryptogenic stroke (stroke of undetermined etiology on TOAST criteria) than non-COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

In coagulopathy conditions associated with COVID-19, elevated D-dimer levels were the most common finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The long-term effect of COVID-19 on the elevated D-dimer is estimated to reach 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 40-year-old male came to the neurology department with complaints of lack of concentration, sluggish mind, and forgetfulness. The patient has a positive COVID-19 history and is currently tested negative. Complaints have been felt since 6 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and continued 5 weeks since the onset of acute COVID-19. The patient started experiencing symptoms of acute COVID-19 without respiratory symptoms. Initial complaints were fever, anosmia, and fatigue. Fever varied between 38.5 and 40.5°C. During the acute COVID-19 phase, the patient was isolated at the Wisma Atlet, Jakarta. The patient’s O<sub>2</sub> saturation had dropped to 88%, and then, he received oxygen therapy with a nasal cannula. He experienced a memory deficit in which he did not recognize his family members. The results of the MoCA-Ina examination showed a score of 30 meaning that there is no cognitive impairment.\n\n【8】The patient did not show weakness in the legs or arms. On neurological examination, including motor, sensory, and cranial nerve functions, no neurologic deficits were found as commonly found in stroke. The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart problems, stroke, TIA, thromboembolism, or other vascular diseases. Medical, family, and psychosocial history were normal. However, the noncontrast MSCT scan confirmed the presence of hypodense lesions on the right lateral ventricles and calcifications on the pineal body and lentiform nucleus. It can be concluded that CVA was obtained with multifocal lacunar cerebral infarction, especially on the left lateral ventricle .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Multiple lacunar hypodense lesions on the CT scan.</u>\n\n【10】Laboratory tests were performed 5 weeks after the onset of acute COVID-19 and showed an increase in D-dimer of 1.22 g/ml. The other laboratory parameters for stroke panel were normal (cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride, blood glucose level, and hemoconcentration). Pharmacological therapy was provided in the form of oral anticoagulants rivaroxaban (10 mg), citicoline (500 mg), vitamin D3 (1000 IU), and vitamin B complex. The follow-up showed significant improvement, and the patient became fully independent with modified Rankin Scale measurement.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】This study reports a case of ischemic stroke with multiple lacunar infarcts in patients with a history of COVID-19. COVID-19 was confirmed by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, and the diagnosis of ischemic stroke was confirmed by an MSCT scan of the head.\n\n【13】Besides the presentation of ischemic stroke, other complaints are prolonged fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, and memory problems. In self-isolated patients, the most common symptoms of physical exhaustion were fatigue (35%), increased need for rest (30%), and lack of energy (29%), while the most common symptoms of mental exhaustion were difficulty in finding words (23%), difficulty in concentrating (19%), and memory problems (18%). More than half of COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate illness experience those symptoms 6 months after the infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The onset of neurological symptoms ranges from 3–14 days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. It is in line with the Global COVID-19 registry (the average delay between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the onset of stroke is 7 days) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In a study in New York, the median age of stroke patients was 62.5 years and the median time between the onset of the first COVID-19 symptoms and stroke was 10 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Referring to the Global COVID-19 registry, the imaging characteristics of stroke in COVID-19 involve 22.7% large vessels and 7.6% lacunar 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In this case, post- COVID-19 ischemic stroke occurred in a relatively young patient (40 years) without preexisting cerebrovascular risk factors which were rarely reported before. Considering the age of the patient and no accompanying cerebrovascular risk factors can help show that COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for acute ischemic stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Early-onset cerebrovascular disease is more common in COVID-19 patients with underlying cerebrovascular risk factors including older age (>65 years) and very few reported cases of stroke in younger patients (<50 years) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Based on the TOAST guidelines, specific vascular risk factors for ischemic stroke are diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The incidence of stroke has been reported in 5.7% of patients with severe COVID-19 and in 0.8% of patients with nonsevere infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The frequency of stroke detected in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 1.1% associated with older age and stroke risk factors. Frequent cryptogenic strokes and elevated D-dimer support increased risk of thromboembolism in COVID-19 which is associated with high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The significant increase in D-dimer levels in patients with acute ischemic stroke suggests that COVID-19 can induce an inflammatory response and trigger a hypercoagulable state causing an acute ischemic stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 supports the formation of small and/or large blood clots in many organs such as the brain, which have the potential to cause cerebrovascular disease (ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【19】D-dimer is a degradation product of fibrin cross linking. Increased D-dimer levels indicate global activation of hemostasis and fibrinolysis, and it is in line with the COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability hypothesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Increased D-dimer levels confirm the theories of endothelial activation and hypercoagulability, but other mechanisms are under investigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Some other plausible proposed mechanisms involved in stroke in COVID-19 are viral neurotropism, endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, and inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The possible effect of hypercoagulability as a cause of stroke after COVID-19 infection is still unclear although some recent case reports in young patients with few/no comorbid risk factors have the potential to lead to this hypercoagulability mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. A COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state from a proinflammatory process can be hypothesized as a possible contributing mechanism for the higher prevalence of embolic cryptogenic stroke presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【21】As COVID-19 infection has been found to lead to a hypercoagulable state, in this case, the role of anticoagulation is important. The pharmacological therapy provided was rivaroxaban oral anticoagulant.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【23】In conclusion, this study reports a case of ischemic stroke after acute COVID-19 in a relatively young patient without preexisting cerebrovascular risk factors.

Chondroid syrinoma of the external auditory canal is an extremely rare benign neoplasm representing the cutaneous counterpart of pleomorphic adenoma of salivary glands. Less than 35 cases have been reported in the international literature. Case Presentation. We report a case of a 34-year-old male in whom a rapidly growing, well-circumscribed tumor arising from the external auditory canal was presented. Otoscopy revealed a smooth, nontender lesion covered by normal skin that almost obstructs the external auditory meatus. MRI was performed to define the extension of the lesion. It confirmed the presence of a 1 . 5 × 0 . 8  cm T2 high-signal intensity lesion in the superior and posterior wall of EAC without signs of bone erosion. The patient underwent complete resection of the tumor. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic examination. Conclusion. Although chondroid syringoma is extremely rare, it should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of an aural polyp. Chondroid syringomas are usually asymptomatic, slow-growing, single benign tumors in subcutaneous or intradermal location. In our case, the new information is that this benign tumor could present also as a rapidly growing lesion, arising the suspicion for malignancy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Chondroid syringoma or mixed tumor of skin is a benign neoplasm of sweat gland origin. It arises most frequently in the nose, cheek, scalp, forehead, upper lip, and chin. Chondroid syringomas of the external auditory canal are extremely rare. Less than 35 cases have been reported in the international literature. All authors agree that the tumors in this location derive from the ceruminous glands in the skin of the external auditory canal. The tumor is usually presented in patients between 20 and 60 years as a slowly growing, encapsulated, painless subcutaneous mass. In the case reported here, the tumor presented as rapidly growing solid mass in the external auditory canal of a young man. We discuss the diagnosis, differential diagnosis of this mass, and the relevant literature.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 34-year-old Caucasian man, resident doctor, was referred to our Department of Otolaryngology with the complaint of a painless mass in the posterior wall of the right EAC associating with a reduction in hearing. He has been noticed the lesion three months ago. The otoscopy revealed a smooth, nontender lesion covered by normal skin that almost obstructs the external auditory meatus . The threshold tonal audiometry confirmed a transmission hearing loss in right ear. An MRI was performed to define the extension of the lesion. It confirmed the presence of a 1.5 × 0.8 cm T2 high-signal intensity lesion in the superior and posterior wall of EAC without signs of bone erosion . The lesion was excised surgically, and the histopathologic examination revealed a chondroid syringoma .

Discussion\n\n【12】Chondroid syringoma is a rare mixed tumor of the skin that was first described by Hirsch and Helwig in 1961 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a benign neoplasm of sweat gland origin that occurs most frequently in the head and neck region. The commonest sites are the scalp, cheek, nose, upper lip, chin, and the forehead. Extremely rare sites include eyelid, orbit, and scrotum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Chondroid syringoma arising from the EAC is also extremely rare. Only 35 cases have been reported in the English literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Typically, tumor presents in male patients between 20 and 60 years as a slowly growing, painless, subcutaneous mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In our case, the tumor was presented only three months before the diagnosis, and it was rapidly growing. The patient was a resident doctor, and we could consider his medical history reliable.\n\n【14】The diagnosis is usually made retrospectively based on histopathological findings. Mixed tumor of skin histopathologically consists of tubuloductal epithelial structures of sweat gland origin and is associated with chondroid changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Differential diagnosis should include basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma, neurofibroma, histiocytoma, implantation dermoid, and sebaceous cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Although chondroid syringomas are predominantly benign, malignant forms have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Although chondroid syringomas of external auditory canal are slowly growing tumors, in this case, the rapid growing of the skin lesion raised the suspicion of a malignancy. Therefore, surgical excision and histopathological examination were compulsory to exclude this possibility.\n\n【16】Preoperative evaluation by MRI is superior to that by CT, enabling differential diagnosis of other tumors of EAC and indicates possible erosion in the bony tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. For cases that no erosion of the bone is indicted, surgical excision is the treatment of choice. A complete resection is required to prevent recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】Chondroid syringoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of small subcutaneous nodules in the EAC, in middle-aged male patients. Although malignant forms and recurrence are extremely rare, wide excision of the tumor and long-term followup are the most effective ways of management.\n\n【19】#### Abbreviation\n\n| EAC: | External auditory canal. |\n| --- | --- |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This second necrotic area was not initially suspected because there were no ECG changes in the anterior leads and the left descending coronary artery did not present any significant stenoses on emergency coronary angiography. Unrecognised myocardial infarction may carry important prognostic implications. CMR is currently the best imaging technique to detect unexpected infarcts.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Myocardial infarcts are routinely detected by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion or CMR imaging. Rioufol et al. showed with intravascular coronary ultrasound (IVUS) that although only one lesion is clinically responsible during an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), ACS seems to be associated with pan-coronary destabilisation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. CMR is the gold standard technique to visualise myocardial necrosis and evaluate myocardial viability after an acute coronary syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Moreover, Wagner et al. demonstrated that although SPECT and CMR detect transmural myocardial infarcts at similar rates in animals, CMR systematically detects subendocardial infarcts that are missed by SPECT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We present a case of an unexpected coexisting myocardial infarction (absence of significative stenosis on coronary angiography) detected by delayed enhancement MRI, which was unseen by SPECT.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 41-year-old man was referred to our department with an inferior acute myocardial infarction. He was smoker with hyperlipidaemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 169 mg/dL). The time symptom onset to admission to the intensive care unit was ten hours. His 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats/min with persisting ST elevation and Q waves in the inferior leads. Emergency coronary angiography revealed an acute thrombotic occlusion of the second segment of the right coronary artery, a severe stenosis of a non-dominant and small circumflex coronary artery and diffuse plaques in all segments of the left anterior descending coronary artery 删除1:<u>(Figure 1, Panel (c) and (d))</u>; the patient underwent angioplasty and (bare metal) stenting with a good final result 删除1:<u>(Figure 1, Panel (a) and (b))</u>. Initial CMR was performed five days after the acute event. Steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine sequences showed normal wall motion in the anterior area and severe myocardial hypokinesia in the inferior wall. Black blood T2 images (T2 weighted short inversion-time, inversion-recovery (STIR) breath hold pulse sequences) suggested myocardial oedema in the inferior wall 删除1:<u>(Figure 2, Panel (e))</u>. CMR detected transmural delayed enhancement in the inferior wall associated with late microvascular obstruction 10 minutes after gadolinium injection 删除1:<u>(Figure 2, Panel (f) and (g))</u>. Surprisingly, another area of hyperenhancement which was subendocardial was found in the mid anterior wall of the left ventricle within the distribution of the left anterior descending coronary artery territory.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Initially, the coronary angiography showed an acute thrombotic occlusion on the second segment of the right coronary artery (Panel (a)).

There were many diffuse lesions on the left anterior descending coronary artery and his branches without significant stenosis (Panel (d)). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Black blood T2 images (T2 weighted short inversion-time, inversion-recovery (STIR) breath hold pulse sequences) suggested myocardial oedema (arrowheads) strictly in the inferior wall 删除1:<u>(Figure 2, Panel (e))</u>. Gadolinium-enhanced images 通用删除1(英):<u>(Inversion Recovery turboFLASH 3D short axis and long axis sequences)</u> demonstrated transmural late enhancement of the inferior wall (arrowheads) associated with late microvascular obstruction (Panel (f) and (g)). Furthermore, these sequences showed a subendocardial delayed enhancement area  which was located in the anterior wall at mid-ventricular level in favour of a limited necrosis (Panel (f) and (g)). Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with thallium-201 suggested hypoperfusion in the inferior and lateral walls during stress but did not detect at rest any hypouptake in the anterior wall (Panel (h)). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】The patient remained well and asymptomatic during follow-up. CMR and myocardial scintigraphy were also performed in this patient 3 months later. CMR again showed persistent areas of delayed enhancement in the inferior wall transmurally and subendocardial enhancement in the anterior wall at the mid-ventricular level. Myocardial scintigraphy suggested myocardial ischaemia in the inferior, lateral and basal walls in favour of a restenosis, but this study did not detect any myocardial necrosis in the anterior wall 删除1:<u>(Figure 2, Panel (h))</u>. Restenosis on the right coronary artery was confirmed by coronary angiography. The left anterior descending artery remained unchanged with diffuse nonobstructive plaques.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】In a patient with acute inferior myocardial infarction, CMR was able to detect an unexpected coexisting area of necrosis in a different vascular territory. CMR findings in animals confirm that the subendocardial infarcts detected by CMR correspond to histologically defined myocardial infarcts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In our case, despite absence of significative stenoses in the left descending coronary artery, CMR found an area of necrosis in the anterior wall. We cannot affirm that this anterior subendocardial infarction was not caused by coronary angiography. However, we hypothesise that the 2 myocardial infarctions seen on delayed enhanced MRI are the consequence of pan-coronary destabilisation, although the anterior infarct could very well be an old infarction that was so far not recognised. The lack of T2 hypersignal and the lack of microvascular obstruction in the anterior wall are in favour of a chronic myocardial infarction in this segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We can suppose that this area of limited necrosis is a consequence of a spontaneous atherosclerotic plaque rupture on the left descending coronary artery. These nonrecognised infarcts may be quite frequent and carry important prognostic implications, as it is known that spontaneous coronary atheromatous plaque rupture, without significant underlying stenosis during first acute coronary syndrome, healed without significant plaque modification in 50% of cases with medical therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. CMR is currently the best imaging technique to detect unexpected infarcts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. Thus, detecting these infarcts enables important additional information regarding to the risk stratification, eventually targeted therapy and carefully surveillance in these patients with high risk of cardiovascular events.\n\n【11】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【12】To conclude, the incidence of unrecognised coexistent myocardial infarcts may be underestimated and not infrequent. Of particular interest, this case highlights the possibility to detect these coexisting subendocardial infarcts using CMR. We believe that CMR has advantages, at least in patients with discrepancies between therapeutic success and missing clinical improvement.\n\n【13】Consent  \nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Leiomyosarcomas of vascular origin are particularly rare tumors occurring mainly in the inferior vena cava (IVC). They are malignant, slow-growing tumors with a poor prognosis. This paper reports on a rare case of surgical resection of an IVC leiomyosarcoma mimicking a hepatic tumor. Case Presentation. A 65-year-old Japanese male was admitted for evaluation of an abdominal tumor. Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images, with no enhancement or washout in late-phase images. We diagnosed this tumor as either a hepatic tumor in the Spiegel lobe or a retroperitoneal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma and performed a laparotomy. On the basis of surgical findings, we extirpated the tumor by performing a wedge resection of the wall of the IVC and suturing the primary IVC wall. Pathological findings led to a further diagnosis of the tumor as a leiomyosarcoma originating in the IVC. Thirty-seven months after the operation, multiple liver and lung metastases were detected, and the patient died from multiple organic failures. Conclusion. We experienced a rare case of a leiomyosarcoma of IVC mimicking hepatic tumor.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Leiomyosarcomas are malignant tumors of smooth muscle cells that can originate in any location but occur most often in the uterus, retroperitoneum, or intraabdominal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Leiomyosarcomas of vascular origin are particularly rare tumors occurring mainly in the inferior vena cava (IVC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The International Registry of Inferior Vena Cava Leiomyosarcomas revealed that most tumors occur in the lower (44.2%) or middle (50.8%) region of the IVC, while only a small number of tumors occur in the upper third or suprahepatic region (4.2%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Leiomyosarcoma of IVC was first described by Dzsinich et al. in 1992 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. There are no definitive symptoms, but typical symptoms include dyspnea and a general feeling of being unwell accompanied by weight loss and abdominal and/or back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A correct diagnosis is difficult, and, in up to one-third of cases, it is not made until after a postmortem examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Diagnosis is made using modern imaging techniques such as ultrasound, echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In spite of the advancement of modern imaging techniques, it is difficult to diagnose a leiomyosarcoma preoperatively, and in some cases it is also difficult to distinguish it from a hepatic tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This paper reports on a rare case of surgical resection of an IVC leiomyosarcoma mimicking a hepatic tumor.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 65-year-old Japanese male was admitted for evaluation of an abdominal tumor. The tumor was detected by chance during a chest CT performed for a lung examination. The patient had no past history of any abdominal surgery, and his vital signs were stable. There is nothing particularly significant in the findings of the laboratory examination. Tumor markers are negative.\n\n【6】Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>, with no enhancement or washout in late-phase images 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging of this tumor revealed a contrasting low intensity on the T1-weighted image 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u> and high intensity on the T2-weighted image 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed no evidence of a malignant tumor in the gastrointestinal tract. We diagnosed this tumor as either a hepatic tumor in the Spiegel lobe or a retroperitoneal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images ((a) arrow), with no enhancement and washout in late-phase images ((b) arrow). |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen.

To expose the affected IVC lesion, we need to mobilize some parts of the right lobe of the liver. This tumor was not located in the liver but originated in the IVC. We extirpated the tumor by performing a wedged resection of the wall of the IVC and sutured primary IVC wall. We controlled the bleeding from the IVC using the hemostatic forceps. The resected specimen was solid with a smooth surface . Microscopic examination revealed that the tumor consisted of uniform and spindle cells and had a fascicular growth pattern. This pathological feature was compatible with a mesenchymal tumor 删除1:<u>(Figure 4(a))</u>. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that α\\-SMA and HHF35 were expressed in this tumor 删除1:<u>(Figures 4(b) and 4(c))</u>, and c-kit and CD34 were negative. The MIB-1 index was about 60% 删除1:<u>(Figure 4(d))</u>. The tumor was diagnosed as a leiomyosarcoma originating in the IVC. The patient’s recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 10. After 12 months, the tumor was detected in the Spiegel of the liver on enhanced CT of the abdomen . We diagnosed it as a recurrence of the leiomyosarcoma. We suggested to the patient and his family that he should undergo additional treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgical resection, but they declined this.

Discussion\n\n【15】Leiomyosarcomas originating in the IVC are rare, malignant, slow-growing tumors with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Tumor metastases of this slow-growing malignant tumor to other organs are relatively infrequent, but can be detected in the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, or bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In this case, there were no symptoms, and the tumor was detected by chance in a chest CT. Present day imaging techniques such as abdominal ultrasonography, echocardiography, CT, and MRI are commonly employed to make a rapid and precise diagnosis of a suspected leiomyosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case we could not preoperatively diagnose the tumor as leiomyosarcoma of the IVC and also could not rule out a potential liver tumor. A final conclusive diagnosis is of course made by means of histopathological and immunohistochemical methods. The pathognomonic findings of leiomyosarcoma are spindle-shaped tumor cells with positive markers for smooth muscle cells, vimentin, muscle actin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and desmin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The recommended therapy for treating leiomyosarcoma is aggressive surgical removal of the tumor by means of modern vascular surgery, in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8, 10\\]</u>. In surgery, a complete resection of the tumor was possible, and the IVC was repaired primarily via surgical means without too high a risk of postoperative edema. For leiomyosarcomas, there is a perioperative mortality of 4%, and 42% of the patients died of the disease itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. To reduce the tumor size and increase the resection rate, a preoperative neoadjuvant therapy can be implemented. If, however, a complete tumor resection is not possible, tumor reduction followed by radiation therapy provides a good palliative treatment option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Postoperative therapy and the management of recurrence are difficult because of the absence of evidence for their effectiveness in patients. Radiation has been used in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, and some authors believe that it may help with the local control of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. For localized, resectable, soft-tissue sarcomas, adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin or a combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide has been shown to prolong the time before recurrence and the overall rate of survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This therapy may thus also be effective in the treatment of IVC leiomyosarcoma. A case has been previously reported in which an IVC leiomyosarcoma with liver metastasis was positive for steroid receptors, including the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The patient received combined multimodal therapy, including resection of the tumor, intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy, and hormonal manipulation. Thus hormonal manipulation using medroxyprogesterone and/or tamoxifen should be tried in ER/PR-positive cases. Although there is no established treatment for patients with IVC leiomyosarcoma, we hope that thorough investigation of this condition will help establish a standard treatment yielding satisfactory results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In a series of case studies of 14 patients with a leiomyosarcoma of the IVC who underwent generous resection followed by radiation, it was established that radiotherapy reduced local recurrence and increased the median survival time. In addition, a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been reported as being superior to radiotherapy alone with respect to an increase in the survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The long-term outcome of surgery for leiomyosarcoma of the IVC has been disappointing.

We present an 18-year-old high school student who presented with a sore throat, macular rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fevers, and joint pains. He presented with acute kidney injury and confusion with multiple tests and was eventually diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Presentation\n\n【3】An 18-year-old African male high school student with no prior comorbid conditions presented with a 2-day history of tonsillitis and was noted to have a macular rash that started on his chest and extended to his arm. He had received symptomatic treatment by a school clinician with oral chlorohexidine and lozenges. Three days into the initial symptom, he developed abdominal cramping and multiple episodes of non-bloody diarrhea, watery in nature, without nausea nor vomiting. He also had fevers and joint pains (both wrist, elbows, and knees). He was taken to a nearby health facility, where he was noted to have a high temperature and tachycardia. Within 24 hours in this facility, he developed confusion and was reported to have increasing creatinine, which rose from 200 μmol/L to 400 μmol/L. Treatment received included ceftriaxone 2 grams once a day for three days, paracetamol 1 g three times a day, loperamide 2 mg with every episode of diarrhea, and one dose of IV methylprednisolone 1 g. Given his deterioration, he was transferred to our facility for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n【4】On arrival at this hospital, he was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, febrile at 40 degrees Celsius, hypotensive at 70/40 mmHg, and desaturating to 86% on room air. His GCS was 14/15; respiratory exam revealed bilaterally coarse crepitations throughout the lung fields with an audible S3 gallop rhythm on cardiovascular examination. Per abdomen was distended, tense with hypoactive bowel sounds. The musculoskeletal examination was unremarkable. He underwent acute management with fluid resuscitation, an urgent central line was placed, and he was initiated on inotropic support at 0.4 mcg per kilogram per minute.\n\n【5】The initial laboratory findings included a full hemogram which depicted an elevated white cell count of 27.12 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dl (normocytic normochromic), and platelets of 281 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Inflammatory markers were elevated with a procalcitonin of 71.58 ng/ml and C-reactive protein of 287 mg/L. The kidney fuctions were deranged with a creatinine of 494mmol/L, urea 26.70 mmlols/L, sodium 128 mmol/L, potassium 4.87mmol/L, and bicarbonate 15.5 mmol/L (blood gas analysis supoorted a metobaolic acisosis with a pH7.33, PCO2 23 PO2 122 and HCO3- 19.8). His liver function test represented ischemic hepatitis with an elevated AST of 1461 units/L ALT 812 units/L normal bilirubin (hepatitis screens A, B, and C were negative, including an HIV test). Urine analysis showed proteinuria with protein three-plus and blood four plus (with no red blood cells) and a urine albumin creatine ratio confirming proteinuria of 52.28 mg/mmol. The cardiac markers were elevated with a troponin of 17,137 ng/ml with an elevated creatine kinase of more than 7800 units/L. At this point, a diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease and rheumatic fever was entertained; an ASOT titer was obtained, being negative.\n\n【6】His radiological investigation included a chest X-ray that showed a feature of pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly; a 2D echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a low ejection fraction of 30 to 35% and normal valves. A CT scan abdomen showed distended bowel with splenic and renal infarcts as highlighted in Figures 1 and 2, and an HRCT redemonstrated the cardiomegaly and bi-basal lung atelectasis.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showing multiple hypodense wedge-shaped parenchymal defects involving the cortex and medulla consistent with renal infarcts (black arrow).</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showing hypodense pyramidal wedge-shaped defect consistent with splenic infarcts (black arrow).</u>\n\n【9】Multiple differential diagnoses were entertained at this point, such as vasculitis (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, medium-sized vasculitis) and multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, which has been superimposed by septic shock. Within a few hours, the patient deteriorated, requiring intubation, and his norepinephrine requirements had increased to 0.7 mcg per kilogram per minute. He had been initiated on meropenem one gram three times a day and was started on urgent dialysis to help with the pulmonary edema, and supportive management was commenced for the fevers (given liver dysfunction, paracetamol was avoided, and other measures were integrated, which included cooling and icepacks). Because of the above differential diagnosis, an autoimmune panel was sent. Complement 3 and Complement 4 (C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>) were low at 0.51 g/L and 0.04 g/L, respectively. The patient was initiated on a low-dose steroid pulse at 250 mg once a day and, due to the high risk of immunosuppression secondary to the steroids, was given broader cover with vancomycin 500 mg twice a day (renally adjusted doses); the rest of the autoimmune panel results are as follows: positive beta2-glycoprotein IgA antiphospholipid antibody and negative ANA, antiDS DNA, ENA, pANCA, and cANCA. COVID-19 PCR from tracheal aspirate and nasal swab was negative. However, to our surprise, the COVID-19 antibody test was positive, giving us strong evidence that our patient was suffering from the multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. By this point, all cultures, including blood and urine, had no growth.\n\n【10】With the first pulse of steroids, the patient showed marked improvement with a decreasing pressor requirement from 0.7 mcgs of norepinephrine to 0.16 mcgs. Currently, the patient is doing well and has been successfully extubated, off inotropic support, with good urine output. He has remarkably overcome an acute process with four days of treatment with antibiotics and steroids and will continue on a tapering dose of steroids. He was successfully discharged from the hospital with some mild left leg weakness. As demonstrated by the MRI in Figures 3 and 4, the brain had developed small lacunar infarcts with residual neurological deficits.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 ADC mapping with an area of low signal intensity (left image orange arrow).

Discussion\n\n【14】Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is where you have multiple organ inflammation, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. COVID-19 pneumonia in children presents very mild symptoms and can often be asymptomatic. There is a specific criterion that should be met for the diagnosis of MISC. As per the European and US center of disease prevention and control the diagnostic criteria is as follows: <21 years of age, fever for more than one day, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and more than two organ failure with a positive SARS-COVID 19 PCR or positive antigen test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As seen in our case, the criteria were met given that the patient was 18 years old and had increased inflammatory markers evidenced by increased CRP and ferritin levels. The patient also had multiple organ failure including a positive antigen test, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain.\n\n【15】The pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia in children is similar to that of adults, where viral entry is via angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2, the difference being that fewer receptors in children give milder symptoms. In MIS-C, once the viral entry has been established, the early infection activates the macrophages after the T-helper cells causing cytokine release 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. One after that develops a hyperimmune state by activating the B-cells causing the production of autoantibodies. The hyperimmune state leads to autoantibodies attacking the endothelial cell and gastrointestinal cells; myocardial damage’s exact mechanism is unknown, but one can present with myocarditis or acute ischemic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The clinical presentation of MIS-C is a multisystemic disease, one of the most common manifestations is fevers occurring in 97–100% of patients, and dermatological manifestation includes rash and conjunctivitis (30–94%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestation are the most common presenting complaints which include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Cardiac involvement includes features of myocarditis and ischemic events; around 31–100% of the patients may have left ventricular diastolic function evidenced by an echocardiogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thrombotic complications like splenic infarction and cerebral strokes are also common manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. On the other hand, renal infarctions are rare, and only a few cases reported in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have developed renal infarctions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. Based on this evidence, one can see that the above patient presented with almost all the clinical signs making the diagnosis even stronger.\n\n【17】Acute kidney injury is prevalent amongst the SARS-COVID-19 patients. AKI and renal parenchymal disease may be caused by the ACE-2 receptors on the kidney parenchyma, causing microvascular injury triggered by the cytokine storm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. As noted in outpatient, there was proteinuria, which has been reported in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The theory is that viral replication occurs in the podocytes causing damage that can ensue in proteinuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Renal infarction resulting in AKI is rare; studies have shown renal infarction resulting in AKI but none requiring hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This case stands out as it is one of the only cases of renal infarction requiring renal replacement therapy. Most cases of renal infarction lead to AKI with no additional intervention required.\n\n【18】There is a unique coloration between SARS-COVID-19 pneumonia and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; there can be an elevated anticardiolipin IgA antibody or an anti-B2-glycoprotein I IgA and IgG antibodies (as seen in our patient); this manifestation can lead to cerebral vascular infarctions, although studies do not support this hypothesis as in antiphospholipid syndrome it is the IgM and IgG titers that collate to thrombotic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Further studies need to be conducted to prove the thrombotic sequela amongst those with increased IgA titer, as clearly evidenced not only in our patient but in other case series conducted by Zhang et al. where all three patients had thrombotic events (multiple cerebral infarctions) and positive anticardiolipin IgA, anti-β2-glycoprotein I IgA, and IgG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【19】MIS-C and COVID-19 pneumonia is a pediatric syndrome characterized by increased inflammatory markers, fever, and multiorgan failure. There is a significant increase in the risk of morbidity and mortality, but some cases have a reasonable response rate, as seen in our patient. The unique events of positive IgA antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombotic events as seen in our patient may need further studies to prove any correlations.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】COVID-19 pneumonia can lead to MIS-C resulting in multiple organ inflammation. Patients with MIS-C are more prone to thrombotic events and multiple organ failures. Therapies with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins have been shown to improve outcomes significantly. AKI caused by renal infarction is rare; this may be the only case resulting in renal infarction requiring renal replacement therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Presented is a case of a young adult male with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome presenting with multiple episodes of long bone fractures caused by low energy trauma with one of the fractures exhibiting significantly delayed healing. The patient was also found to have an asymptomatic stress fracture of the lower extremity, another finding of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome rarely reported in the literature. A thorough review of the literature and comprehensive presentation of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is provided in conjunction with our case.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Report\n\n【3】An 18-year-old male with history of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome diagnosed at the age of two presented with acute right mid leg pain while cutting to kick the ball during a soccer game. He reported a history of prior right leg fracture four years ago sustained while playfully wrestling with his younger brother. After the prior fracture healed, the patient noticed a bump at the level of his mid right shin, which corresponded to the site of the patient’s current leg pain. He denied any pain in the right leg prior to sustaining the fracture, and he denied any other preexisting medical conditions.\n\n【4】Presenting radiographs of the right tibia-fibula showed mild deformity of the right tibia from prior healed fracture with mildly displaced and comminuted fracture through the mid diaphysis of the tibia . Focal anterior cortical thickening of the tibia was present at the level of the acute fracture. The fracture was treated with closed reduction and casting. Serial follow-up radiographs obtained over the next 13 months showed delayed and incomplete union across the tibia fracture . At the 13-month follow-up, additional radiographs of the left tibia were obtained to evaluate a focal painless bump of the mid left shin the patient reported developing shortly after his right tibia fracture.

Introduction\n\n【21】Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) was first described in 1868 by Auguste Rothmund in inbred family members with an unusual rash and juvenile cataracts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Sydney Thomson in 1923 described a condition in patients with a similar rash and skeletal anomalies but no cataracts, which he called “poikiloderma congenitale” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In 1957, Taylor postulated that these two syndromes share the same pathophysiology and proposed the name Rothmund-Thomson syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. RTS is a rare genetic disorder with only a few hundred cases reported in the literature. RTS typically presents with a poikilodermatous rash in infancy in conjunction with a wide array of other dermal, skeletal, and gastrointestinal findings. While RTS is associated with diminished bone mineral density creating a potential risk for pathologic and stress related fractures, there is little literature discussing the occurrence of fractures in RTS patients. This case illustrates the risk of stress and acute insufficiency fractures in a patient with diffusely demineralized bones related to RTS.\n\n【22】##### 2.2. Etiology and Incidence\n\n【23】RTS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It is frequently, but not always, associated with a mutation in the RECQL4 gene. This association was first discovered in 1999 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and has led to RTS being divided into two disease types: patients with a mutation in the RECQL4 gene (RTS type 2) and patients without RECQL4 gene mutation (RTS type 1). Approximately 66% of patients with RTS have a mutation in the RECQL4 gene, which encodes one of the five proteins in the RecQ helicase family of proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. RecQ helicase proteins unwind DNA during replication or repair, and mutations in the RECQL4 gene are believed to cause inaccurate DNA replication and repair leading to an increase in genome instability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is uncertain how this inaccurate DNA replication and repair lead to the specific physiologic abnormalities associated with RTS. While a specific gene mutation has not been identified for most of the other third of patients with RTS, it is believed that most of these patients likely have a mutation in another gene encoding a protein in the RecQ helicase family. Recently, in 2010, a second gene (C16orf57) mutation was identified in three families with RTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The C16orf57 gene has been found to contribute to synthesis of U6 snRNA, which is important for gene splicing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, how mutations in the C16orf57 gene specifically lead to the development of RTS and the prevalence of the C16orf57 gene mutation in the RTS population remain unknown.\n\n【24】RTS is typically diagnosed in the first two years of life when the characteristic skin rash appears. No race or gender predilection for the disease has been identified. The incidence of RTS and carrier frequency of the RECQL4 gene mutation is unknown; however, there have been less than 400 reported cases in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【25】##### 2.3. Clinical Findings\n\n【26】The diagnosis of RTS is made on clinical findings. The diagnosis of RTS can be made definitively if the characteristic poikilodermatous rash demonstrates the classic age of onset (between three and six months old), spread (beginning in the face and spreading to extensor surfaces of the extremities), and appearance (erythema/swelling gradually transitioning to chronic hyper- and hypopigmentation, telangiectasias, and skin atrophy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A diagnosis of probable RTS can be made if an atypical poikilodermatous rash is present in conjunction with two of the following findings: sparse scalp hair, sparse eyelashes and/or eyebrows, small stature, gastrointestinal disturbances in childhood, radial ray defects, radiographic bone abnormalities, dental anomalies, nail abnormalities, hyperkeratosis, juvenile cataracts, and osteosarcoma/skin cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The characteristic poikilodermatous rash is invariably present, typically presenting before one year of age. Areas of decreased scalp hair or eyebrows/eyelashes are also common. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as chronic diarrhea or emesis have been reported in approximately 17% of patients. Although juvenile cataracts are one of the first described findings of RTS, it is a relatively uncommon finding being seen in less than 10% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【28】##### 2.4. Imaging Findings\n\n【29】While most of the findings of RTS will be elicited on clinical exam and history, there are several characteristic findings that will be encountered on imaging of the teeth and skeleton. Several types of dental abnormalities have been described in association with RTS, including rudimentary or hypoplastic teeth, microdontia, delayed eruption, supernumerary or absent teeth, ectopic eruption, and increased incidence of caries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Skeletal anomalies are seen in approximately 75% of patients, with anomalies including osteopenia, pathologic fractures, dislocations, patella ossification anomalies, metaphyseal irregularities, and radial limb abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 12\\]</u>. A strong association has been found between mutations in the RECQL4 gene and the presence of these skeletal anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Patients with RTS carry increased risk of developing both skin cancers and osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is the most common malignancy occurring in RTS, with an incidence as high as 30% reported in some studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A strong association has also been found between osteosarcoma and presence of the RECQL4 gene mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The appearance of osteosarcoma in RTS is similar to sporadic osteosarcoma with RTS patients having a slightly earlier mean age at diagnosis of between 9 and 12 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【31】##### 2.5. Treatment and Prognosis\n\n【32】There is little published data on the life span of patients with RTS. However, in the absence of malignancy, the life expectancy is likely close to normal. Treatment of RTS primarily consists of preventative and surveillance care. Baseline skeletal radiographs by 5 years of age are recommended to identify underlying skeletal dysplasias, as are annual ophthalmic exams to identify cataracts. Calcium and vitamin D supplements may also be given in RTS patients that have bone demineralization or history of fractures. Patients are advised to avoid excessive sunlight, and close monitoring for changes in skin lesions is recommended due to the increased incidence of skin cancer. No screening recommendations for osteosarcoma have been described, but a low threshold for imaging is recommended in patients presenting with bone pain due to the increased risk for malignancy. The treatment recommendations for skin cancer and osteosarcoma are the same for RTS patients as for the rest of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【33】##### 2.6. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【34】Two other syndromes are also associated with mutations of the RECQL4 gene, RAPADILINO, and Baller-Gerold syndrome. Patients with RAPADILINO will often have osteopenia, small stature, radial ray defects, patellar hypoplasia, and GI abnormalities similar to RTS patients. However, RAPADILINO lacks the characteristic poikiloderma rash, with patients instead presenting with café au lait spots 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Baller-Gerold syndrome (BGS) also presents with osteopenia, short stature, radial ray defects, and other skeletal dysplasias similar to RTS, and patients with BGS may have poikiloderma. However, BGS patients frequently exhibit craniosynostosis, which is not typically associated with RTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) describes a group of heredity disorders of connective tissues characterized by increased bone fragility and decreased bone mineral density. OI is the most common cause of pediatric osteoporosis with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 12,000 to 15,000 children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. While some forms of OI present with multiple deforming fractures or perinatal death, the more retarded forms of the disease can present with short stature, osteoporosis, and only a few bone fractures, similar to RTS. However, OI is not associated with radial ray deformities; and wormian bones are present in the skull in approximately 60% of patients with OI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, a feature not common in RTS. No specific skin changes have been described with OI. However, some forms of OI are associated with a blue sclera, which is a characteristic not seen in RTS.\n\n【36】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【37】Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder most commonly characterized on imaging by dental and skeletal abnormalities, particularly radial ray defects. Skeletal abnormalities are particularly common in RTS patients with mutations in the RECQL4 gene, and RTS patients with skeletal abnormalities are at increased risk for pathologic fragility fractures and delayed fracture healing due to associated diminished bone mineral density. Unfortunately RTS patients with the RECQL4 gene mutation are also at a high risk of developing osteosarcoma, which may also present as a pathologic fracture. Therefore, careful consideration for underlying malignancy should be made in all fractures occurring in RTS patients.\n\n【38】#### Abbreviations\n\n| BGS: | Baller-Gerold syndrome |\n| --- | --- |\n| cm: | Centimeters |\n| FOV: | Field of view |\n| kVp: | Peak kilovoltage |\n| mAs: | Milliampere-second |\n| mL: | Milliliters |\n| mm: | Millimeters |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| OI: | Osteogenesis imperfecta |\n| PD: | Proton density |\n| RTS: | Rothmund-Thompson syndrome |\n| ST: | Slice thickness |\n| TR: | Relaxation time |\n| TE: | Echo time. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Coil and stent migration is a potentially catastrophic complication in endovascular neurosurgery, which may lead to cerebral thromboembolism. Techniques for removing migrated coil and stent are not well established. Methods and Results. We present three cases in which coil or stent migration occurred during endovascular embolization of a cerebral aneurysm. The Merci Retrievers were used successfully in all cases to remove the displaced foreign bodies. Technical details are described. Conclusion. The Merci Retriever device can be utilized successfully for removal of migrated coils and stents in endovascular neurosurgery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Occlusion of cerebral aneurysms by detachable coils through the endovascular approach has gained significant popularity over the last two decades and is now a common approach for securing cerebral aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Migration of coils or stents from their targets represents one of the most challenging complications of endovascular neurosurgery and contributes significantly to thromboembolic events following endovascular embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. No “gold standard” method has been identified for retrieval or repositioning of the migrated foreign bodies, but several different techniques and devices are described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–9\\]</u>. The Merci Retriever device is FDA approved for percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in patients who have suffered ischemic stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Case reports have demonstrated its use for removal of foreign bodies during endovascular embolization of cerebral aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. Here, we present use of the Merci Retriever for correction of coil prolapse and stent misplacement in three patients undergoing endovascular coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms. Additionally, we review the literature describing this use of the Merci Retrieval device.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【6】A 53-year-old woman presented with subjective sensation of retroorbital pulsation. Digital subtraction angiogram demonstrated a 10 mm left supraclinoid ophthalmic artery aneurysm with a 5.5 mm neck. She underwent elective stent-assisted coiling of this aneurysm. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia. Clopidogrel 600 mg and aspirin 325 mg was given through a nasogastric tube at the beginning of the case. Femoral artery access was established with a 7 F 11 cm sheath. Heparin was given intravenously to maintain activated coagulation time between 250 and 300 seconds throughout the case. A Neuroform-3 (4 × 20 mm) stent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was deployed across the aneurysm neck. The aneurysm was then embolized using two HydroFrame coils (MicroVention, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) through an Excelsior SL 10 microcatheter (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) positioned within the aneurysm dome 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(a) and 1(b))</u>. A Hydrosoft 10 helical 4 × 6 mm coil (MicroVention, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) was then chosen to continue the embolization. During delivery the coil detached from the delivery system without activation of the release mechanism. A long portion of the coil was left in the cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) proximal to the aneurysm 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(c) and 1(d))</u>. Retrieval of the displaced coil was first attempted using the Alligator 4 mm Retrieval Device (ev3 Endovascular, Inc, Plymouth, MN, USA), but this was unsuccessful. An Amplatz 4 mm GooseNeck Microsnare (ev3 Endovascular, Inc, Plymouth, MN, USA) was then used for retrieval, but this resulted in further coils prolapse 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(e) and 1(f))</u>. At this point the ICA developed significant vasospasm. Nicardipine was infused intra-arterially with radiographic improvement. Abciximab (Reopro, Centocor, Malvern, PA, USA) 0.125 mcg/kg/min was also started to prevent thromboembolic complication. A Merci V 2.5 Soft retriever (Concentric Medical Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA) was advanced to the displaced coil and engaged the coil loops. Multiple fragments of the coil were retrieved. A remaining coil fragment was jailed to the vessel wall by placement of another Neuroform 3 stent 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(g) and 1(h))</u>. A 6 French Envoy guide catheter was used in the ICA, and this was removed simultaneously with the Merci device (Codman & Shurtleff Inc, Raynham, MA, USA). Post-operative angiogram shows near complete occlusion of the aneurysm. Flow in the ICA and its branches were normal 删除1:<u>(Figures 1(i) and 1(j))</u>. Abciximab was stopped 6 hours after the procedure. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged to home neurologically intact. On three-month followup the patient remains neurologically normal (modified Rankin score = 0); and she has 20/20 vision bilaterally. She reported significant improvement in her subjective retroorbital pulsation. Magnetic resonance angiogram 1 year after procedure shows no evidence of aneurysm recurrence or coil compaction.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) and (b) Left carotid artery injection, lateral view; and plain X-ray.

Case 2\n\n【9】A 75-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation presented with Hunt Hess grade four subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Digital subtraction angiography revealed a 2.5 mm right posterior communicating artery (PCOM) aneurysm with irregular dome 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(a) and 2(b))</u>. She underwent emergent ventriculostomy and stent-assisted coiling of the ruptured aneurysm. Femoral artery access was established with a 7 F 11 cm sheath. Heparin was not given. A Prowler Select Plus microcatheter (Cordis Endovascular, Miami Lakes, Florida, USA) led by a Synchro 2 soft microwire (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was advanced into the distal ICA. An Enterprise 4.5x22 mm stent (Cordis, Bridgewater Township, NJ, USA) was deployed across the neck of the aneurysm. Migration of the stent was noted during deployment, but it still covered the neck of the aneurysm. Tirofiban 0.1 microgram/kg/min was started intravenously. Two HydroCoil 10 coils (2 mm × 4 cm) (MicroVention, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) were initially deployed into the aneurysm through a SL-10 microcatheter (Boston Scientific). During coiling embolization several loops of the coil bulged into the parent artery 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(c) and 2(d))</u>. A decision was made to deploy an overlapping stent to hold the coil mass in the aneurysm. A Renegade Hi-Flo microcatheter (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) led by a Synchro 2 soft microwire was advanced into the vasculature. Significant migration of the previously placed stent was noted when the microcatheter and microwire passed through the Enterprise stent and the coil mass herniated out of the aneurysm 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(e) and 2(f))</u>. Attempts to engage the stent and coils using the Synchro 2 soft microwire were without success. A Merci V 3.0 firm Retriever was advanced into the ICA led by an 18 L Merci microcatheter (Concentric Medical Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA). We were able to engage the coils and stent and pulled them into the cavernous segment. A Merci V 2.5 soft Retriever was then advanced to the ICA. The Retriever engaged the coils and the stent again but attempts to pull them into the 6 F Envoy MPD guiding catheter (Codman & Shurtleff Inc, Raynham, MA, USA) were unsuccessful. At this point the coil/stent mass dislodged from the Merci device. The Merci Retriever, the 18 L Merci microcatheter, and the 6 F guiding catheter were then removed. A 7 F Envoy catheter led by a 0.038 glidewire was then used to select right carotid artery, and the tip of guiding catheter was placed at the distal cervical ICA near petrous bone. The 18 L Merci microcatheter led by a Synchro 2 soft microwire was again advanced into the distal ICA. The microwire was then removed, and a Merci V 2.0 Firm Retriever was advanced. The coils and the stent were pulled to the tip of the guiding catheter. The guiding catheter, the microcatheter, and the Retriever along with the coils and the stent were successfully removed out of the sheath. Examination of the objects on the field showed that the stent and the coils were intact without missing pieces. A postretrieval angiogram shows that the aneurysm was stable and the right ICA was patent without evidence of arterial dissection, pseudoaneurysm, or occlusion.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | (a) Noncontrast head CT demonstrates diffuse SAH.

A control angiogram after final coil deployment shows obliteration of the aneurysm 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(g) and 2(h))</u>. The stent was patent. An intracranial run showed that the distal ICA and its branches were normal in caliber without vasospasm or thromboembolism. Clopidogrel 600 mg and aspirin 325 mg was given at the end of the procedure. A repeat angiogram 3 days later showed moderate vasospasm and a secured PCOM aneurysm. Unfortunately the patient’s clinical exam did not improve significantly, and the family decided on palliative care. She expired one month after the initial hemorrhage.\n\n【12】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【13】A 68-year-old man presented in 2010 with recanalization of a previously treated anterior communicating artery (ACOM) aneurysm 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(a))</u>. He had a history of Grade I SAH in 2004 from a ruptured 15 mm ACOM aneurysm. He was treated initially with endovascular coiling in 2004, and a repeated coil embolization was performed in 2008. A decision was made to treat this recurrent aneurysm with further coiling. Femoral artery access with a 7 F sheath was obtained. A 6 F Envoy guide catheter was introduced into the left ICA over a guidewire. Superselectively, the aneurysm was catheterized with a SL-10 microcatheter and a Synchro 10 microwire. A 3 × 6 mm Orbit Galaxy coil (Codman & Shurtleff Inc, Raynham, MA, USA) was deployed in the aneurysm, but not detached since the coil was oversized and herniated in the parent vessel. Subsequently, a 2 × 4 mm Galaxy Xtrasoft coil (Codman & Shurtleff Inc, Raynham, MA, USA) was deployed in the aneurysm. As soon as it was detached, the flow carried the coil from the aneurysm to the left A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(b))</u>. A repeated injection demonstrates thrombosis of the left A2 without flow distal to the migrated coil 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(c))</u>. At this point the SSEP signals were lost from the right leg. The decision was made to retrieve the coil with a Merci retriever, but the angle of the left A1/A2 junction was too acute to allow delivery of the Merci device from the left. An exchange maneuver was performed to replace the femoral access with an 8F sheath. An 8F Merci balloon guide catheter (Concentric Medical Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA) was also exchanged to replace the 6 F Envoy catheter and placed in the right ICA with the aim to diminish flow by inflating the balloon at the tip of the Merci guide while we are retrieving the coil. The left A2 was then catheterized through the right A1 with an 18 L Merci microcatheter. The microcatheter was advanced proximal to the migrated coil first, and 8 mg of tissue plasminogen activator was infused. The catheter was then taken distal to the coil, and a V2.0 soft Merci retriever was deployed and successfully ensnared the migrated coil 删除1:<u>(Figures 3(d) and 3(e))</u>. With the proximal balloon inflated, the coil was brought down to the tip of the guide catheter. At this point, we were unable to bring the coil inside the guide catheter, so the Merci retriever was removed, and an Alligator 2 mm Retrieval Device (ev3 Endovascular, Inc, Plymouth, MN, USA) was utilized to grab the coil and bring it inside the guide catheter. Postprocedure angiography demonstrates patency of the Left A2 删除1:<u>(Figure 3(f))</u>. At this point the SSEP signals returned to normal. Postoperatively the patient remains neurologically intact and was scheduled for a repeated coiling in the future.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 | (a) Lateral view of left carotid injection demonstrates recanalization of the previously coiled ACOM aneurysm.

Discussion\n\n【16】With the widespread use of endovascular treatment for aneurysms comes the new consideration of retrieving dislodged foreign bodies intravascularly. Even in Guglielmi’s original clinical series, coil migration into the parent artery was a recognized possibility, but it was considered only prior to coil deployment when it could be readily corrected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The risk of coil migration is influenced by anatomical, flow, and technical factors. Coil migration risk is thought to increase as the width of the aneurysm neck increases. The risk of coil prolapse can be mitigated when treating wide-neck aneurysms by the use of a stent- or balloon-assisted technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Tortuous vessels and high-flow conditions are also thought to increase the risk coil migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. On the technical side, premature coil deployment and the use of undersized coils are the significant factors for coil migration. When prolapsed from the aneurysm, the coil acts as a conduit for aggregation of blood components ultimately leading to thrombosis and possibly distal thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Coil migration is not an uncommon occurrence and increase the risk of cerebral thromboembolism. A retrospective study of 1811 endovascularly treated aneurysms demonstrated coil migration in 2.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Early studies suggested that prolapsed coils increases the risk for ischemic events following endovascular aneurysm treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>, a suspicion that was later confirmed by Derdeyn et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In their study of 178 consecutive patients, Derdeyn et al. found that aneurysm size and coil protrusion were the only two variables with significant association to postprocedure ischemic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Of these patients, there were 21 occurrences of coil prolapse, which includes four of the nine patients with postprocedure ischemic events.\n\n【18】Because of the increased risk for thromboembolism, once detected, coil migration should be managed immediately. Systemic heparinization during coil placement confers protection against cerebral thromboembolism in the immediate period. Definitive treatment, however, is removal of the coil from the parent artery. A number of techniques have been derived, but none have gained acceptance as a gold standard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Prior to deployment, the coil or stent can simply be retracted by the delivery device and repositioned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Microsnares have been employed in some instances of coil migration, including coil migration in the MCA and distal ACA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 19, 20\\]</u>. Microsnare retrieval can be accomplished in vessels with a >3 mm diameter; however if the vessel diameter makes the loop opening difficult, then the use of the microsnare carries a risk of dissection or perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The Alligator Retrieval Device has recently been introduced and used for both coil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> retrieval and retrieval of misplaced stents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Stent deployment has been utilized as a means of trapping migrated coils into the aneurysm sac or against the vessel wall with promising results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 22\\]</u>. Additionally, partial stent deployment has been used to removed herniated coils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Open surgery may also be an option in cases where endovascular retrieval is not possible, but this is obviously more invasive and not necessarily more effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24–29\\]</u>.\n\n【19】A review of the literature reveals several reports of the Merci Retriever device utilized for the management of coil migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14, 30, 31\\]</u>, which are summarized in Table 1 along with the cases presented here.\n\n【20】Table 1 Vora et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> reported the case of a 37-year-old man who suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage from vertebral confluence aneurysm. During treatment of the aneurysm by stent-assisted coil embolization, a misplaced coil became entangled with the stent during attempted repositioning. The Merci device was utilized successfully for removal of the stent-coil complex, and the aneurysm was subsequently embolized. O’Hare and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported migration of the coil from a PCOM aneurysm to the MCA, which once free in the MCA was successfully retrieved using an old-generation X6 Merci Retriever.\n\n【21】O’Hare and colleagues reported unsuccessful use of the Merci Retriever to retract a coil prolapsed through a Neuroform 3 stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. In this scenario, the Merci Retriever was successful in grasping the misplaced coil; however the coil became caught on the stent at the time of retraction. The authors were not successful in removing this coil. It is likely that there have been other cases of unsuccessful use of the Merci Retriever that have not been reported, and more research is necessary to determine the role the Merci Retriever will play in the treatment of coil migration complications.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【23】Misplacement of intracranial coils or stents remains a potential hazard in endovascular neurosurgery. The Merci device provides a secure technique for retrieval of herniated coils. Our experience demonstrates that the Merci device can be used successfully to rescue patients with this potentially devastating complication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Dengue is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It is an endemic virus in tropical countries. In Colombia, 4 serotypes are present (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4) and the disease is a burden for public health, social programs, and the economic sector. It is transmitted in two ways: the vertical one (from mother to child) and the vector through the bite of infected mosquitoes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, and it has also been reported during transfusion of blood components and organ transplant. The main vector is Aedes aegypti, although transmission through the Aedes albopictus mosquito is also described in the literature, which has a lower transmission capacity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, and most infections are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. The hemorrhagic appearances of severe dengue are due to plasma leakage as a result of increased vascular permeability, severe thrombopenia, and hemoconcentration.\n\n【4】In 2020, 78,979 cases of dengue were reported in Colombia. 38,836 (49.2%) of them reported warning-free signs, 39,246 (49.7%) with warning signs, and 897 (1.1%) of severe dengue. Dengue incidence in Colombia on a regional basis is 295.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants at risk. For Huila, incidence rates higher than 500 cases per 100,000 inhabitants are estimated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Dengue is a disease that has a wide spectrum of signs affecting different organs and systems; sometimes, special therapies are required to maintain the proper functioning of the different affected organs. Among the main cardiovascular complications of dengue, it is the dengue shock, which is considered as the clearest way of plasma leakage and the main cause of the potential fatal outcome of the disease. This is an acute state of cardiovascular dysfunction leading to an inability to carry enough amounts of oxygen and nutrients to meet metabolic needs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. As it is well-known, viral diseases are immune system activators, triggering off a loss of tolerance in it. Dengue is not an exception, and it is able to explain different autoimmune phenomena including macrophage activation. Mechanisms have been described by which an exacerbated response of the disease is triggered through the increase of infected cells, formation of immune complexes, and complement pathway activation, which lead to a cross-reaction of viral antigens with epithelial cells and platelets with subsequent endothelial dysfunction and bleeds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The first description of Evans syndrome was made in 1951 by Evans et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. This syndrome is characterized by the combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and, less common/usual, immune neutropenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–14\\]</u>. This disease’s etiology is unknown, and the dysregulation of the immune system is among its possibilities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 13, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Here, we present the case of an unusual hematological and immunological complication of a patient who developed Evans syndrome during severe dengue, taking into account the concomitantly limited literature available for these two diseases, the need for a broader diagnostic approach, multidisciplinary intervention, and a more complex therapeutic approach.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Clinical Case\n\n【9】A 6-year-old male patient (weight: 19 kg, SD: −0.70; height 113 cm, SD: −0.56; BMI: 14.9 SD: −0.41) with no significant medical history, coming from the first level of care with clinical manifestation of 5-day evolution, consistent nonquantified fever, asthenia, adynamia, myalgia, arthralgia, emetic episodes, abdominal pain, and headache. The patient was hospitalized with a probable dengue diagnosis with warning signs. He shows a torpid clinical course, with epistaxis, progressive thrombopenia, dengue hepatitis, oligoanuria, 20% right pleural effusion, fever persistence, and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient was taken to the pediatric ICU due to his proven severe dengue diagnosis. In follow-up tests, positive IgM serology for dengue, hematological affection was documented due to bicytopenia (anemia and thrombopenia) without evidence of external or hidden bleeding  requiring platelet transfusion on two occasions; it was decided to transfuse because the patient had already overcome the dengue critical phase, and this decrease was progressive until high-bleeding risk values from vital organ are associated with severe hemodynamic affection, secondary to Evans syndrome and not to a hematological manifestation of dengue.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Platelet and hemoglobin behavior of the patient with severe dengue and Evans syndrome.Hemoglobin levels are shown in area form, and their values appear on the left axis Platelet levels are shown as a line, and their values are shown on the right-hand axis.</u>\n\n【11】Given the atypical course of the disease, an interdisciplinary approach was used on the part of the pediatric subspecialties of infectious diseases, hemato-oncology, and rheumatology. Studies were prolonged including autoimmunity profile, bone marrow aspiration, and biopsy (findings: nonnecrotizing epithelioid granuloma), polycultures (negative blood cultures 1 and 2, negative urine culture, and negative myeloid culture), negative infectious profile (IgM and IgG serologies for negative Toxoplasma gondii; negative cytomegalovirus; negative Epstein–Barr; negative hepatitis A, B, and C studies; nonreactive HIV ELISA; and nonreactive VDRL), and biomarkers (positive Coombs test). The patient was considered to have Evans syndrome, and treatment with immunoglobulin was suggested, 2 g/kg/total dose, with a partial response and subsequently a steroid cycle with prednisolone, a dose of 1 mg/kg/day initially with programmed titration until suspended. Outpatient follow-up was carried out for 6 months after discharge, and the patient was discharged due to pediatric hemato-oncology and rheumatology. Clinical improvement was documented with supervision of the described condition without relapse on cytopenia and nonadministration of the oral steroid.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】The first description of Evans syndrome was made in 1951 by Robert Evans, who studied 24 patients with ages between 3 and 78 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. This disease consists of the combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombopenia and less usual, immune neutropenia (between 15 and 55%) and can be classified as primary or secondary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–14\\]</u>. Its etiology is unknown and among the possible causes it is the dysregulation of the immune system which leads to the production of IL-10 and interferon gamma, leading to activation of Autoreactive T Lymphocytes and production of autoantibodies by B lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 13, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【14】In the literature review, reports of dengue hemolytic anemia cases are considered to be of low prevalence. These reports are about adult patients. In the description by Aye et al. it is reported a male patient who develops hemolytic anemia during the dengue recovery phase. This finding could be related to the severity of the disease and this etiological agent should be taken into account as a cause of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, so much that it is compared with Mycoplasma pneumoniae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The case report by Kulkarni and Sharma describes a 52-year-old patient with Dengue and warning signs. Hemolytic anemia is subsequently documented with a positive Coombs test. In general, patients with dengue have anemia due to viral medullary aplasia and documented bleedings; having hemolytic anemia is considered an atypical manifestation of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Although the diagnostic criteria are clearly described, underreporting may take place in relation to the number of cases diagnosed and published since, in some situations, the direct Coomb's test may be negative. One reason is because in some commercial antiglobulin reagents, the IgG sensitization is below the detection threshold. Another cause is that if the optimal conditions are not found in the analytical phase, for example, if the preparatory wash is not carried out at 4°C or with a low ionic strength, the elimination of the low affinity IgG can be generated. As a third cause, sensitization of red blood cells with just one IgA or with low molecular weight (monomeric) IgM, not accompanied by complement fixation, may result in a negative test since a large variety of commercial antiglobulin reagents have only anti-IgG and anti-C3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Nowadays, treatment is based on immunomodulatory therapy schemes depending on the clinical conditions of the patient and comorbidities. The first line of treatment includes oral corticosteroids at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day and IV immunoglobulin at a dose of 2 g/kg/total dose; both options were used in this case for the management of cytopenia secondary to Evans syndrome. In severe cases, the use of steroids is recommended at initial doses of 4–6 mg/kg/day during the first 72 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Although transfusions are not recommended due to the risk of exacerbation, they are only prescribed in cases of severe hemodynamic affection and risk of vital organ affection, as it is evidenced in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The second line of management is the immunosuppressive drugs: azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, ofetil, vincristine, danazol, sirolimus, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab or surgical management with splenectomy, especially in patients with frequent relapses or in those who receive high doses of corticosteroid aimed at reducing doses and minimize their side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 14, 15\\]</u>.

The prognosis of primary malignant dural B-cell-type lymphoma is relatively benign and may be treatable by surgical resection with or without postoperative focal radiotherapy. We report our experience in three cases of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma of dura mater (PDL) mimicking a meningiomas.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】From 2012 to 2018, in the Clinic of Neurosurgery of Ancona three patients affected by primary dural lymphoma have been admitted. The first patient was a 49-year-old man with clinical history of personality and mood change and the second a 64-year-old woman with onset of right-handed and lateral hemianopsia. An MRI study with contrast documented the presence of expansive lesions with surrounding edema and isointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, characterized by an intense post-contrastographic enhancement, with dural implant, located in the first case in the right frontal region, and in the second case, in the left occipito-parietal region . Due to the intracranial lesion position and imaging characteristics, a typical meningioma was suspected in both cases. Both patients underwent a craniotomy with complete macroscopic excision of the tumor. Intraoperatively, the lesions, even though adherent to the dural structures, appeared with infiltrative characteristics, variable consistency (pseudofibrous shoots), intense vascularization, and bleeding , but complete excision of tumor was performed in each case. Histology documented dense polymorphous lymphoid proliferation and large lymphocytes were found. Immunohistochemical study revealed specific antibody for B-cell lymphocytes in tumor cell membranes (CD20+, CD3−, CD30−, EMA−, CD79a+, MUM1+, IgMcit +, IgD−, CD10−, CD5−, Tdt−, Cd34−, BCL6, and BCL1 negative). The MIB-1 index was 15% in the first case and 20% in the second. These pathological features were compatible in each case with malignant lymphoma of diffuse large B-cell type. No extra cranial tumor was identified in further radiological exams in the two patients. In 2018, we observed a 26-year-old woman admitted at our department with one-month history of left arm weakness. Neurological examination was negative. A cerebral MRI study with enhancement documented a solitary right fronto-parietal dural-based extra-axial mass causing moderate mass effect. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, presenting homogenous enhancement, with evidence of dural tail. Imaging characteristics were consistent with right fronto-parietal convexity meningioma , but a mass reduction of the lesion at CT-scan after 1 week of corticosteroid therapy raised a doubt . Right frontal craniotomy was performed with macroscopic excision of the tumor adherent to the dura with infiltrative characteristics a pseudofibrous consistency . The postoperative cranial wound infection was treated with antibiotics therapy without bone flap plates removal and complete recovery. Histopathological analysis documented lymphocytic and plasmacytoid cells, consistent with a diagnosis of PDL. Immunostaining was CD20+, CD3−, CD30−, EMA−, CD79a+, MUM1+, IgMcit+, IgD−, CD10−, CD5−, Tdt−, Cd34−, BCL6, and BCL1 negative, Mib-1 5%. Postoperatory staging studies PET and total body CT were negative. Only in the first case, the patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy treatment. In the second and third cases, the watch and see option was chosen with radiological controls. Both patients are currently alive without recurrence, while in the first case, the patient died in 2015 due to complications not related to cranial pathology.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 MRI study with contrast documented the presence of expansive lesions and isointense on T1-weighted, and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, characterized by an intense post-contrastographic enhancement, with dural tail, located in the first case in the right frontal region (a) and in the second case in the left occipito-parietal region (b).</u>\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 Intraoperative image of first case: the lesions, even though adherent to the dural structures, appeared with infiltrative characteristics, variable consistency (pseudofibrous shoots), intense vascularization, and bleeding.</u>\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 (a) MRI study with enhancement documented right fronto-parietal dural-based extra-axial mass causing moderate mass effect.

Discussion\n\n【11】Primary dural lymphoma (PDL) is a very rare disease, and most commonly it occurs in the 4<sup>th</sup>–6<sup>th</sup> decade of life predominantly in women. The incidence of this tumor varies from 0.6 to 3% of all brain neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>. Iwamoto et al. reported an incidence about 2.4% on 355 patients with primary CNS lymphoma in their institution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Meningeal involvement of lymphoma, as a result of systemic disease, can occur extremely rare. For patients with PDL the most predominant histopathological finding is a low-grade marginal B cell lymphoma (MZL).\n\n【12】Primary dural lymphoma (PDL) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of meningiomas. In O’Neil series of 15 patients with PDL, a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of meningioma was made in 14 out of 15 patients prior histopathological diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The PDLs share many features, including higher incidence in women and frequent occurrence of more than one extrassial lesion. When suspecting a PCNLS, enhanced MRI is the exam of choice, but neuroimaging findings are similar with meningiomas: both tumors present with extra-axial lesions that appear iso-hypointense on T1-weighted MR images and diffusely enhance with gadolinium. Moreover, dural tail sign, en plaque thickening of meninges, calvarial hyperostosis, and bone erosion have been common finding in both, but underlying vasogenic edema appears most common in PDL and depending on mass size and location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 10\\]</u>. Cerebral convexities are the most common site of involvement, but other sites are falx, tentorium, sellar, and suprasellar regions. Other differential diagnoses include dural metastasis, fibrous tumors, gliosarcomas, leiosarcomas, or neurosarcoidosis.\n\n【13】Primary dural lymphoma is a rare disease, and no standard treatment is described in literature. Surgical total excision remains the gold standard of treatment. Because complete resection of PDL may be technically difficult due to multiple tumors and infiltrative and en plaque presentation, many adjuvant drugs were indicated: systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy with R-CHOP, high dose of methotrexate, cytarabione, and vincristine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. As reported in the retrospective analysis by Quinn et al. given the rarity of diagnoses and paucity of available data, an optimal treatment strategy is still under debate. If complete resection is achieved, clinical and radiological follow-up, with no additional treatment, is appropriate; however, in most cases, adjuvant treatment with either radio or chemotherapy is necessary. Adjuvant radiotherapy is preferable because PDL is very radiosensitive, and it requires relatively low doses of radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. High-dose metrothexate and R-CHOP are the most effective drugs for parenchymal CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), but the effect is unclear in PDL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 9\\]</u>. In conclusion, there is no guideline in the treatment of PDL, so the decision should be tailored on each patient, based on the immunological and histopathological characteristics of the lesion. If leptomeninge are involved, chemotherapy or whole brain irradiation is required. Finally, when postoperative cranial wound infection develops the antibiotic therapy with or without tissue debridement grant recovery as in other surgical infections; the titanium plates of the bone flap may be maintained, but other complications may occur (subdural hematoma, subdural hygroma, intraparenchimal hematoma, hydrocephalus) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. A primary dural lymphoma has a better prognosis than parenchymal primary CNS lymphoma or systemic lymphoma with CNS metastasis. PDL are biologically indolent, with survival rates at 5 years around 70%, with positive response to surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 6, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【14】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【15】Primary dural lymphoma is a very rare disease, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other tumors of dura mater and/or cranial bone. Our cases illustrate that intracranial lymphoma may rarely present as a wide dural-based mass mimicking a meningioma clinically, radiologically, and intraoperatively. So it must be considered in the differential diagnosis for all extra-axial enhancing lesions. Since PDL is very rare, there is no standard treatment for this tumor, so the decision should be tailored on each patient, based on the immunological and histopathological features of lesion. However, surgical excision and radiotherapy are the gold standard of therapy which grant good outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Similar cases from the literature are reviewed and speculation about the relationship of these diseases is offered. Although the occurrence of these diseases together could be coincidental, an association seems immunologically plausible. Thus, relapsing polychondritis might be an unusual systemic manifestation of alopecia areata.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

It has been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, including thyroid disorders, vitiligo, and possibly atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Case Report\n\n【5】A 71-year-old retired welder with a 28-year history of alopecia universalis developed poison ivy on the right forearm. Three weeks later, after complete healing of the poison ivy, the patient noted pain, redness, and tenderness of his right ear. The earlobe was spared. Shortly thereafter, the patient's nose became red and tender, and his left ear developed similar changes . He was treated with antibiotics with no improvement. Because of severe, persistent inflammation of the cartilage of both ears and his nose, a diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis was considered. One week later, prednisone therapy was begun at a dose of 40 mg per day. Prompt resolution of his signs and symptoms occurred. One month later, as prednisone therapy was being tapered, the patient developed hoarseness and a severe sore throat. Rigid telescopy in the ENT clinic found marked swelling of the arytenoids and false vocal cords. Corticosteroids were increased with resolution of his symptoms. Still later, iritis of the left eye occurred. The patient's eye symptoms responded promptly to an increase in corticosteroid therapy. Interestingly, after six weeks of prednisone 30 mg per day, the patient's beard regrew and he shaved for the first time in 28 years!  There was no regrowth of hair on other parts of his body, including the scalp, axillae, eyelashes, or perineal area. Eleven months into the patient's illness, he developed profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. An autoimmune basis for his complaints was suspected. There was no history of fever, weight loss, prior similar symptoms, wheezing, or shortness of breath. The physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Ear inflammation with sparing of ear lobe. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | Chin whiskers after prednisone therapy. |</u>\n| --- |\n\n【8】Routine laboratory studies that were normal or within the expected range included complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, urinalysis, prostate-specific antigen, thyroid stimulating hormone, c and p antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, and protein-electrophoresis with immunoglobulins. Sedimentation rate was 43 mm/hr and the antimicrosomal antibody test was positive at 1  :  400 dilution. Pulmonary function tests showed a forced expiratory volume of 78% of predicted and the vital capacity was 71% of predicted, and the carbon monoxide diffusion test was normal. An antibody type II collagen was strongly positive at 65 eu/mL (positive greater than 25 eu/mL). These findings were felt consistent with relapsing polychondritis. A chest roentgenogram was normal.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【10】Alopecia areata is considered a systemic disease, as tissues other than hair follicles are involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Nail changes include pits, ridges, and reddening of the lunulae. Eye changes have included defects in the retinal pigmentary epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient and the two previously cited cases might suggest that relapsing polychondritis could be yet another systemic manifestation of alopecia areata. In each case, long-term alopecia areata preceded the onset of relapsing polychondritis. Two of the three patients had a particularly severe form of alopecia areata, that is, alopecia universalis. The third patient had recalcitrant alopecia areata .\n\n【11】Table 1 Summary of cases.\n\n【12】In alopecia areata, the immune response is directed at the hair follicles and helper lymphocytes are thought to play an important role in pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Malgouries et al. have surmised that the helper t-cell infiltration of the hair bulb correlates with loss of chondroitin sulfate, an important proteoglycan in both hair follicles and cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In point of fact, an important early finding in relapsing polychondritis is loss of proteoglycans in cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Additionally, a cell-mediated immune response to proteoglycans has been reported in relapsing polychondritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. One could envision a scenario in which lymphocytes, initially active against chondroitin sulfate in the hair follicle, later attack chondroitin sulfate in ear cartilage and perhaps other tissues. It should be noted that chondroitin sulfate helps maintain immune privilege in the hair follicle.\n\n【13】Two weeks prior to the onset of relapsing polychondritis our patient developed poison ivy on his right forearm. The area improved with conservative therapy. As in relapsing polychondritis, both helper and suppressor t-cells are important in the pathogenesis of allergic contact dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. We could not, however, identify literature support for hapten formation between urushiol and proteoglycans. Thus, the relationship between the illness we describe and allergic contact dermatitis remains unknown.\n\n【14】Our patient had a regrowth of beard hair following corticosteroid therapy. The first patient reported with relapsing polychondritis following alopecia areata, a 57-year-old woman, had no regrowth of scalp or body hair following prednisolone therapy. The second previously reported patient (a 13-year-old girl) had conventional alopecia areata, followed by relapsing polychondritis. She had a variable response to prednisone therapy but a more lasting response to a combination of cotrimoxazole treatment and prednisone. Her alopecia areata disappeared with this therapy. Interestingly, in a mouse model, androgens offer resistance to alopecia areata and estrogens promote susceptibility to alopecia areata 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Conceivably, our patient's beard regrowth may have been influenced by an androgen milieu in the beard area.\n\n【15】In summary, we present a third case of relapsing polychondritis following long standing alopecia areata. This rare association seems immunologically plausible. As noted by Tobin, both cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity are likely important in alopecia areata 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Likewise, it is possible that there are multiple “targets” of any immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. As suggested by Tosti et al. damage to retinal pigmentary epithelium might follow an immune attack on hair follicle melanocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In a similar vein, relapsing polychondritis could follow a long-term immune assault on a hair follicle proteoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, which is also abundant in ear cartilage and other cartilage-bearing tissues.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The patient presented two months after surgery following a urinary tract infection in septic shock with a discharging sternal wound and blood cultures positive for Proteus mirabilis. Imaging revealed a large anterior mediastinal abscess and aortic pseudoaneurysm which subsequently ruptured resulting in fatality. Gram-negative mediastinitis is a rare complication of cardiac surgery that can present late following initial clinical improvement and should be considered when “remote site” infections are present. Computerised Tomography scanning has a role to play in the identification of this.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Mediastinitis is a recognised complication following median sternotomy. Despite relatively low reported incidences of approximately 1–4%, postoperative mediastinitis poses a detrimental effect on morbidity and survival, with mortality rates as high as 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A plethora of studies exist attributing a whole host of risk factors in the pathogenesis of this condition, sometimes with conflicting views. It is proposed that development of mediastinitis is a multifactorial process involving both host and perioperative factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Most cases of mediastinal wound infections are attributed to gram-positive pathogens with Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated in 70 to 80% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Another complication of cardiac surgery is pseudoaneurysm formation involving the ascending aorta. This is rare with a reported incidence of less than 0.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. These false aneurysms represent a dreaded complication, with rupture as the most deleterious consequence. Postoperative development of aortic pseudoaneurysms is commonly encountered at sites of aortic wall disruption with aortotomy sites being the most commonly implicated following aortic valve replacement.\n\n【5】We report a case of an occult mediastinal abscess presenting in association with a ruptured mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta in the setting of perioperative infection due to a gram-negative pathogen.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】An 84-year-old female with a known history of congestive cardiac failure, hypertension, and stable angina was initially seen in the Emergency Department at Horton General Hospital, Banbury. She presented with an acute onset of rapidly worsening exertional dyspnoea and reduced exercise tolerance. She was subsequently diagnosed with critical aortic valve stenosis following transthoracic echocardiography and underwent an urgent aortic valve replacement. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful except for the development of a pericardial effusion requiring drainage on the 10th day. Microbiological analysis of the pericardial fluid yielded cultures of the gram-negative pathogen, Proteus mirabillis. The patient completed a full course of intravenous gentamicin for 3 weeks with serial negative blood cultures. The wound site appeared to be healing well throughout this time. Further transesophageal echocardiography revealed no significant pericardial effusion and the patient subsequently made a good recovery and was discharged. Further cross-sectional imaging was not performed at this time.\n\n【8】Four weeks following discharge from hospital (two months postoperatively), the patient represented with fever, worsening dyspnoea at rest, and light headedness. She was clinically in septic shock and physical examination revealed an erythematous, warm anterior chest wall alongside a fluctuant swelling overlying the sternotomy scar with some purulent discharge. Laboratory data included a severe normocytic anaemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and significantly raised inflammatory markers. Subsequent blood cultures grew meropenem sensitive Proteus mirabillis.\n\n【9】Initial treatment against the bacteraemia consisted of intravenous gentamicin and meropenem based on a working diagnosis of mediastinitis with or without bacterial endocarditis. The chest radiograph was unremarkable. Subsequent chest CT revealed osteomyelitis of the sternum, contiguous with a large anterior mediastinal abscess measuring 67 mm by 44 mm in diameter . The more interesting radiological feature was the direct communication and erosion of the abscess cavity into the anterior ascending aorta resulting in a localised periaortic area of contrast extravasation . The concomitant presence of endocarditis was ruled out on echocardiography which also revealed the large mediastinal cavity in close proximity to the aortic root as well as a 1.4 cm diameter pseudoaneurysm in the anterior ascending aorta.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | Axial slice from contrast-enhanced CT study depicting sternal osteomyelitis and a large related mediastinal collection (black curved arrow).

In view of her comorbidities, surgery was not deemed a suitable option and consequently the patient died soon after with pseudoaneurysm rupture as the attributed cause of death.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Sternotomy wound complications following cardiothoracic surgery have been well documented in the medical literature and can have varied manifestations from sterile wound dehiscence to suppurative mediastinitis. Mediastinitis is often used synonymously to denote deep sternal wound infections, whereby wound infection is complicated by sternal osteomyelitis with or without the infective involvement of the retrosternal space. Wound discharge is the most common reported feature occurring in 70 to 90% of the cases, with other local manifestations including chest wall tenderness and sternal dehiscence.\n\n【15】Most cases of mediastinal wound infections are attributed to Gram-positive pathogens with Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated in 70 to 80% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> with Pseudomonas being the most reported Gram-negative causative organism. Gram-negative mediastinal infections though less frequently incriminated are often associated with a more complicated postoperative course. In addition these cases are often encountered with other concomitant “remote-site” infections most commonly pneumonias and urinary tract infections which are reported to cooccur in up to 58% of the cases postoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【16】One such postoperative complication demonstrated by this case is the formation of a pseudoaneurysm. Pseudoaneurysms or false aneurysms involving the ascending aorta are rare sequelae of cardiac surgery with a reported incidence of less than 0.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. These aneurysms represent a dreaded complication, with rupture as the most deleterious consequence. Postoperative development of aortic pseudoaneurysms is commonly encountered at sites of aortic wall disruption with aortotomy sites being the most commonly implicated following aortic valve replacement.\n\n【17】Several theories exist regarding the pathogenesis but infection is often heralded as the common denominator as in the case reported herein. Infected or mycotic pseudoaneurysms represent approximately 2.7% of all postsurgical aneurysms and are most often attributed to Staphylococcus and Salmonella species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Early recognition and diagnosis of postoperative infective complications of cardiac surgery are imperative. Patients who have recently undergone open heart surgery that present with chest pain following any infection, even of a site and/or organism that is not usually associated with mediastinitis, should merit a high index of suspicion and should be investigated appropriately.\n\n【19】As demonstrated by this case, clinical improvement, negative blood cultures, and an unremarkable transesophageal echocardiography do not necessarily rule out an ongoing infective process and the development of complications such as a pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】Proteus mediastinitis is a rare complication of open cardiac surgery that can present late following initial clinical improvement and negative blood cultures and can result in potentially fatal pseudoaneurysm formation.\n\n【22】CT scanning has a role to play in the identification of these complications and should be considered prior to discharge in at-risk patients with sternal wound infections.\n\n【23】Postoperative vigilance for infective complications should be maintained after discharge and Gram-negative causative organisms such as Proteus mirabillis should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Signs and symptoms depend on the tumor location and size. The intrapericardial lipoma we report has massive dimensions and mimics a pericardial effusion. A 38-year-old male complained of dyspnea and precordial pain. On physical examination, heart sounds were diminished. The patient had received extensive medication for a clinically suspected pericardial effusion due to heart failure. A voluminous mass resembling fat within the pericardial sac was revealed by transesophageal echocardiography and a computed tomography scan. The tumor was removed successfully by a subxiphoid surgical approach. The diagnosis of a 635 gram intrapericardial lipoma was confirmed by pathological examination. After surgery, the patient recovered well and was completely asymptomatic at a follow-up at 90 days. No medications were being taken since. The diagnosis of a pericardial effusion should be secured by imaging exams to avoid unnecessary medications. Cardiac lipomas can be readily recognized by their typical features on radiologic imaging.

Lipomas represent approximately 10% of all primary cardiac tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–9\\]</u>.

Case Report\n\n【6】A 38-year-old male has complained of progressive dyspnea and sporadic precordial pain related to moderate effort for 5 months. Physical examination showed normal peripheral perfusion, and no edema was detected. On auscultation, no murmurs were heard; however, heart sounds were diminished. Clinically, a pericardial effusion due to heart failure was suspected and treated with pharmacologic drugs. The patient received digoxin, aspirin, furosemide, spironolactone, and carvedilol for 8 weeks until imaging exams were performed.\n\n【7】Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 79% ventricular ejection fraction and a hypoechoic mass within the pericardium attached to the free wall of the right ventricle and atria. A computed tomography scan showed an expansive mass in the anterior region of the pericardium with a homogeneously low density similar to fat. The tumor had a regular shape and measured 14.0 × 10.0 × 16.0 cm. The cardiac lesion extended from the upper to the lower thoracic region, displaced the heart backward, and reduced the right cardiac chambers .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 Voluminous pericardial mass.

No cardiopulmonary bypass was needed. At gross examination, the tumor was split into two irregular fatty fragments measuring 22.5 × 9.0 × 4.0 cm and 21.0 × 15.0 × 2.0 cm and weighing 635 grams 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>.

At a follow-up at 90 days, the patient was completely asymptomatic.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】Most cardiac lipomas are asymptomatic. Therefore, the diagnosis of these benign neoplasms is frequently done on autopsies. Medical literature may underestimate their real prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Generally, they remain indolent for many years since clinical symptoms depend on the growth speed, position, and tumor size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The majority of cardiac lipomas is sessile or polypoid masses implanted in the subendocardium or epicardium.

Size ranges from 1 to 15 cm in diameter, and weight such as 2 kg is described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Symptoms occur when the mass compresses the cardiac chambers and causes hemodynamic changes. Sometimes, it may cause pericardial effusions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Intrapericardial lipomas can cause dyspnea by reducing the pulmonary volume or by elevating the ventricular filling pressures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.

Our patient presented thoracic pain and dyspnea due to a voluminous intrapericardial lipomatous tumor compressing the cardiac chambers.\n\n【16】Chest radiography, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram, tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging play an important role in identifying the lipoma location and relationship to the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 36–38\\]</u>. On chest radiography, cardiac lipomas may mimic hilar neoplasia, diaphragmatic herniation, or mediastinal mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. An echocardiogram can usually define the position and size of the lipoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging establish the fatty differentiation of the tumor, define precisely its insertion and relationship to the cardiac structures, and give additional information to rule out malignant neoplasms, such as liposarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8, 11, 39\\]</u>. Coronary angiography can be useful in cases of coronary compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Imaging exams are important to evaluate the biological behavior of heart tumors. However, malignancy and the definitive diagnosis can be made by histopathological examination only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. On gross examination, lipomas are bright yellow fatty nodules with a delicate capsule. The cut surface is greasy with fine fibrous trabeculae. Under the microscope, lipomas are constituted by mature adipose tissue. There may be areas of steatonecrosis and calcification. Ruling out well-differentiated liposarcomas can be problematic in some cases. The latter contains a few lipoblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In our case, the histological exam excluded malignant criteria.\n\n【18】Although lipomas are benign and slow-growing tumors, the surgical approach is to prevent heart compression and hemodynamic changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 11\\]</u>.

Raising the awareness of clinicians and front-line healthcare workers about the less well-known potential side effects of vaccination is important. We describe the self-limited occurrence of gross hematuria in two elderly men on a combination of aspirin and another antiplatelet or anticoagulant following their second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. While the bleeding seems to be self-limited, the long-term course currently remains elusive.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】While knowledge regarding epidemiologic features, diagnostic tools, and management strategies for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly growing, healthcare systems are still challenged by uncertainties surrounding currently available preventive measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In December 2020, two messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the Emergency Use Authorization pathway in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Published safety and efficacy trials reported high effectiveness at preventing COVID-19-related illness after two interval doses, along with limited side effects and a low rate of adverse reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna Inc. Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. While pain at the site of injection, fatigue, and headache are among the most recognized reported adverse events, little is known about the vaccine’s less frequent potential side effects in the setting of rapid deployment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As COVID-19 vaccinations are now administered globally on a massive scale, rare temporal adverse events are being reported. We describe the self-limited occurrence of hematuria in two patients one day after receiving a second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Patient A\n\n【6】A 71-year-old man was in his usual state of health when he received his second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. The next day, he noted frank blood in his urine. He also reported two episodes of epistaxis. The patient’s past medical history was significant for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction about two months prior to presentation, after which he had been on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. He denied current or past tobacco use.\n\n【7】Vital signs were normal, and the physical exam only revealed dried blood in the right nostril. The urine dipstick showed small amounts of blood. Lab results were significant for a high monocyte count of 1,086 cells/μL (reference range 200–950) . Further urine studies or immunologic assessments were not performed, but the patient was referred to urology. However, he did not establish relationships with them.\n\n【8】Table 1 Laboratory results.\n\n【9】While both hematuria and epistaxis resolved without intervention, the patient’s cardiologist recommended continuing aspirin and holding Plavix for five days. After five days, the patient resumed DAPT and has not had any further bleeding episodes to date. His most recent renal function, about eleven months after the presentation, was normal with a serum creatinine of 0.76 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 91 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.\n\n【10】##### 2.2. Patient B\n\n【11】A 72-year-old man was in his usual state of health when he received his second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. The next morning, he noted “wine-colored” urine. His urine gradually became lighter and was “light pink” by the end of the day. However, he continued to have intermittent dark red urine for the next six days. The only other symptom he endorsed was dull right flank pain.\n\n【12】The patient recalled passing a kidney stone about 22 years prior to the presentation but reported more severe pain at that time. His past medical history was also significant for extensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and atrial flutter. His medications included aspirin (81 mg daily) and rivaroxaban (20 mg daily). While the patient had quit tobacco use 32 years prior to the presentation, he did endorse a 40-pack-year smoking history.\n\n【13】Vital signs were normal, and the physical exam revealed tenderness to deep palpation in the suprapubic region. The urine dipstick showed large amounts of blood. Lab results were significant for mildly elevated levels of INR at 1.2 (reference range 0.8–1.1) .\n\n【14】A urological work-up for painless gross hematuria in the setting of a history of tobacco use revealed a nonobstructing 9 mm stone in the proximal left ureter and a nonobstructing punctate right renal stone. Hematuria resolved after cystoscopy with bladder irrigation.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】The most frequent adverse reactions of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine reported in clinical trials involving more than 30,000 participants were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, and nausea/vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Adverse reactions were reported less frequently in older adults over 65 years of age than in younger individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. COVID-19 Moderna postvaccination bleeding events, including epistaxis, hemoptysis, and vaginal bleeding, have been recorded in the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)’s adverse event reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Since pharmacovigilance data suggest that thrombocytopenia is a frequent postvaccination observation, one proposed mechanism for these bleeding events has been vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Actual COVID-19 infection has also been associated with hematuria. Proposed mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2-mediated hematuria include viral tropism for kidney tissue resulting in tubular obstruction and acute kidney injury by indirect factors (e.g. cytokine-mediated, heme-pigment production) and by a direct viral infection and replication in kidney epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In patients with preexisting, biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, the development of gross hematuria shortly following Moderna vaccination with spontaneous resolution has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In addition to the relapse of preexisting glomerular disease, a wide range of de novo glomerular diseases has been reported shortly after the administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Gross hematuria has been the most common presentation of reported cases of vaccine-associated IgA nephropathy in the literature, followed by acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 10\\]</u>. In the majority of patients, hematuria was self-limited and seldom required immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 10\\]</u>. While the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated, it has been proposed that mRNA-based vaccines result in more robust and/or nonspecific immune activation that may trigger, unmask, or exacerbate autoimmune processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, three cases of nephrolithiasis were reported in association with mRNA-based vaccines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Interestingly, a recent retrospective study in Switzerland did not find a statistically significant association between mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination and an increased incidence of four common glomerulonephritis types (i.e. IgA nephropathy, pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease, and membranous nephropathy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The authors of this study concluded that most cases of new-onset glomerulonephritis manifesting shortly after COVID-19 vaccination are likely the result of temporal coincidence as opposed to causality. They also commented that their findings could not exclude an effect of vaccination on the development of minimal change disease, but the absolute risk would be very small 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Unfortunately, neither one of our patients underwent further urine studies (microscopic urine analyses, quantification of proteinuria), nor a renal biopsy, and therefore, it is not known whether there was any underlying glomerular disease. Furthermore, the association between vaccination and hematuria is only temporal. Similar to the majority of macrohaematuria episodes reported in the literature in association with the COVID-19 vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, our patients’ symptoms began within 2 days after the second vaccination dose. Both patients had normal platelet counts. The hematuria in the patient with nephrolithiasis could certainly have been caused by the kidney stones and his medications. He was on aspirin and rivaroxaban, while the other patient was on aspirin and clopidogrel. Certain medications, such as anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, may increase the risk of postvaccination bleeding; nevertheless, the bleeding resolved itself in both cases. Furthermore, while recurrent hematuria has been reported in some individuals after subsequent doses of the same vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, both our patients have since received and tolerated the Moderna vaccine booster.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【20】We hope that this correspondence will raise the awareness of clinicians and front-line healthcare workers about the possibility of a potential association between new-onset hematuria and mRNA-based COVID vaccines. It is possible that patients and clinicians do not recognize these events as vaccine-related. We strongly encourage reporting these postvaccination events to clarify their true incidence. Moreover, if an association with the vaccine is established and bleeding events remain self-limited, important implications include circumventing the cessation of potentially life-saving medications in patients without persistent hematuria, worsening renal function, or other systemic signs and symptoms. A close follow-up and additional workup are warranted to rule out underlying urologic, nephrologic, or hematologic etiology(ies) with relevant long-term health implications that may have been unmasked by the vaccination. Furthermore, some authors have suggested consideration of an alternative vaccine class for subsequent immunization of patients with vaccine-associated hematuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

However, whereas atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori involves the antrum, the antrum is spared in autoimmune gastritis. Here, we report the use of magnifying endoscopy to identify and distinguish atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori from autoimmune gastritis. The mucosal pattern in autoimmune gastritis is that of closely arranged small round and oval pits, thus differing from the pattern seen in atrophic mucosa due to H. pylori infection. We speculate that this reflects differences in inflammation between the two types of gastritis. In autoimmune gastritis the inflammation is directed primarily against gastric glands, whereas in H. pylori infection the inflammation is directed against the bacteria on or near the surface and the damage initially affects the surface epithelium. During repair, the normal regular round pits are destroyed, whereas they remain largely intact in mucosa with autoimmune-associated atrophy. Confirmation of the features of autoimmune gastritis revealed by magnifying endoscopy would not only make the endoscopic diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis more accurate, but also help to elucidate changes in the surface epithelial structure of gastritis due to various causes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The two most common causes of atrophic gastritis are an autoimmune mechanism or persistent infection with Helicobacter pylori. Ultimately, persistent chronic inflammation may result in severe atrophy of the stomach’s mucosal lining. In autoimmune gastritis the antral mucosa is spared, and characteristically the atrophy is associated with a marked elevation of the serum gastrin level, which may result in type I gastric carcinoid tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In contrast, H. pylori infection affects the gastric antrum and tends to blunt the hypergastrinemic response to hypochlorhydria, gastric carcinoids being uncommon. Although both of these two forms of atrophic gastritis are common, there have been no reports of endoscopically evident features that can reliably distinguish between autoimmune and H. pylori induced atrophic gastritis.\n\n【4】Here we used magnifying endoscopy to identify differences between the two types of atrophic gastritis. The appearance of the gastric corpus in patients with autoimmune gastritis differs from that of atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, which exhibits either ridged surface structures or a villous to granular surface pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. In contrast, the magnified endoscopic appearance of the atrophic mucosa in autoimmune gastritis is similar, but not identical, to that of the corpus in the H. pylori\\-negative stomach. We report our findings obtained using magnifying endoscopy in three patients with autoimmune gastritis. We found that the atrophic mucosa of the corpus in all three patients exhibited a previously undescribed pattern of closely arranged small round and oval pits.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 48-year-old woman presented with epigastric discomfort. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed severe mucosal atrophy in the gastric corpus. Magnifying endoscopy of the corpus revealed closely arranged small round and oval pits with a surrounding network of capillaries. In the antrum, both conventional and magnifying endoscopy demonstrated no abnormal features, and the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having autoimmune gastritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Biopsy specimens were taken from both the antrum and the corpus. The histology of the antral mucosa was normal, whereas that of the corpus exhibited severe atrophy. The serum gastrin level was 4440 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL), and the level of antiparietal cell antibody was ×160 positive. The patient was negative for anti-intrinsic factor antibody and anti-H.  pylori antibody IgG, and the urea breast test gave a result of 2.2‰  (reference range: <2.5‰). The diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis was therefore confirmed.\n\n【8】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【9】A 72-year-old woman presented for a routine health check. Upper GI endoscopy identified severe atrophy of the mucosa in the gastric corpus 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(a))</u>, and magnifying endoscopy showed a pattern of closely spaced small round and oval pits 删除1:<u>(Figure 1(b))</u>. Conventional endoscopy of the antrum demonstrated no abnormality, suggesting a diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis. As this endoscopic examination was part of a routine health check, no biopsy was performed. However, serum samples revealed a gastrin level of 1800 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL) and antiparietal cell antibody ×40 positive, with negativity for anti-intrinsic factor antibody and anti-H. pylori antibody IgG. Autoimmune gastritis was therefore confirmed.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 | (a) Conventional endoscopic finding in the corpus of Case 2.

Case 3\n\n【12】A 58-year-old man had been found to have gastric nodules by X-ray and endoscopic examinations at another hospital. During the endoscopic examination, three nodules were biopsied and one was suspected to be a carcinoid tumor. The other two were diagnosed as atrophic gastric mucosa. A conventional endoscopic reexamination at our hospital revealed multiple nodules on the greater curvature of the corpus 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>, one of which was reddish 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a) yellow arrow)</u>. Magnifying endoscopy showed that this reddish nodule had a gyriform-like structure with an irregular vascular pattern 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(b))</u>. Based on the magnifying endoscopy findings, the reddish nodule was diagnosed as a carcinoid tumor, and this was subsequently confirmed by histological examination of a biopsy sample. Conventional endoscopic examination of the corpus demonstrated severe atrophic gastritis 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(a))</u>. Magnifying endoscopic examination of the other nodules revealed closely arranged small round pits 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(c))</u> and a pattern of closely arranged small round and oval pits was also observed in the mucosa surrounding these nodules 删除1:<u>(Figures 2(b) and 2(c))</u>. Thus, magnifying endoscopy was able to show that this characteristic pit pattern was present even in the atrophic mucosa of the corpus, leading to a diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis associated with a carcinoid tumor. Analysis of the patient’s serum showed a gastrin level of 2700 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL), antiparietal cell antibody ×80 positive, positivity for anti-intrinsic factor antibody, and negativity for anti-H. pylori antibody IgG. The reddish nodule and some of the surrounding nodules that showed closely arranged small round pits were treated by endoscopic mucosal dissection (ESD). The reddish nodule was 3 mm in diameter and histological examination confirmed that it was a carcinoid tumor. The other small nodules showed remnants of fundic glands within the atrophic mucosa 删除1:<u>(Figure 2(d))</u>.\n\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 | (a) Conventional endoscopic findings in Case 3.

Discussion\n\n【15】Strickland and Mackay described autoimmune gastritis as Type A atrophic gastritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. One characteristic of autoimmune gastritis is hypergastrinemia, which may lead to the development of gastric carcinoids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, the histological features of autoimmune gastritis are a normal pyloric glandular mucosa and severe atrophic changes in the corpus, thus differing from those of atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, which primarily affects the antrum. The endoscopic diagnosis is based on an apparently normal antral mucosa alongside severe atrophic mucosa in the corpus. However, it difficult to reliably diagnose autoimmune gastritis on the basis of this criterion alone. Histologically, normal pyloric gland mucosa is taken from antrum, although atrophic mucosa is taken from the corpus in biopsy specimens. However, in a real clinical condition, a diagnosis is only rarely decided from biopsy specimens, and instead, is based on the results of serological examinations for gastrin, antiparietal cell antibody and anti-intrinsic factor antibody. A much more practical approach would be to diagnose autoimmune gastritis by imaging of the morphological features, that is, by using magnifying endoscopy, before serological confirmation.\n\n【16】We have previously described the characteristic features of the corpus in H. pylori infection revealed by magnifying endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u> and classified such H. pylori induced gastritis into four types (the so-called “Z classification”) which excludes an atrophic mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. However, in order to include cases showing an atrophic mucosa, the classification was subsequently modified and renamed the A-B classification system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. The normal mucosa of the corpus without H. pylori infection, as demonstrated by magnifying endoscopy, shows a pattern of regular round pits surrounded by a network of capillaries that coalesce into collecting venules; this is classified as type B-0 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Mild gastritis due to H. pylori shows round pits surrounded by a slightly irregular network of capillaries, and this is classified as type B-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Active gastritis showing round pits with dividing sulci is classified as type B-2, and active gastritis with dilated pits and denser sulci is classified as type B-3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Atrophic mucosa with ridge surface structures is classified as type A-1 and that with villous to granular surface structures as type A-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Magnifying endoscopy shows that atrophic mucosa has an appearance different from that of nonatrophic mucosa. In case 1, closely arranged small round and oval pits were seen in the atrophic mucosa and, based on the above classifications, we considered that the patient had autoimmune gastritis. From this experience, we were able to diagnose cases 2 and 3 as autoimmune gastritis based on these magnifying endoscopic features, which differ from those of the atrophic mucosa in H. pylori infection and are similar but not identical to those of the corpus in the absence of H. pylori (type B-0).\n\n【18】We think that this feature of autoimmune gastritis revealed by magnifying endoscopy is very practical for diagnostic confirmation before ordering serological examination.\n\n【19】Additional cases of autoimmune gastritis studied by magnifying endoscopy are needed to confirm that the pattern described above is truly a unique feature of the corpus in this disease. It is interesting to note that the magnified view of the atrophic mucosa in the corpus of patients with autoimmune gastritis differs from that seen in H. pylori induced mucosal atrophy. We speculate that this may be related to the differences in the pattern and type of inflammation between the two types of gastritis. In autoimmune gastritis, the inflammation is largely mononuclear and directed primarily against gastric glands, whereas in H. pylori infection the inflammation shows an acute on chronic pattern and is directed against the bacteria located on the surface. In H. pylori gastritis, the mucosal damage is largely a bystander effect, and most severe at the surface epithelium. Ongoing inflammation likely influences mucosal repair and does not allow reconstruction of the normal surface epithelium (i.e. the regular round pits are destroyed). In contrast, in autoimmune gastritis, the normal surface structure may remain intact or be subjected to less damage, remaining recognizable in the atrophic mucosa as a pattern of closely arranged round and oval pits.\n\n【20】The changes of surface epithelial structure in various types of gastritis are thought to differ according to cause, and the features revealed by magnifying endoscopy may provide clues for elucidating such changes in surface epithelial structure.\n\n【21】Furthermore, a gyriform-like structure surrounded by closely arranged small round pits in the atrophic mucosa, as seen in Case 3, may be a specific magnifying endoscopic feature of carcinoid arising from autoimmune gastritis. Further accumulation of cases of autoimmune gastritis, observed by magnifying endoscopy, will be necessary.\n\n【22】In conclusion, magnifying endoscopy has shown that, in autoimmune gastritis, the atrophic mucosa in the corpus has a characteristic pattern of closely arranged small and oval pits, thus differing markedly from the appearance of atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection. Magnifying endoscopic observation is thus very useful for diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis. Confirmation of the magnifying endoscopic features of autoimmune gastritis would not only make the endoscopic diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis more accurate but also help to clarify the changes in surface epithelial structure characteristic of gastritis due to various causes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
