{"seq_id": "5066e2fb-6da9-424e-bc43-46410a45b8c4", "title": "", "text": "【0】Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common endocrine and metabolic disease among western and more recently, Asian countries, and is characterized by chronically elevated blood glucose levels. Current projections predict that the global prevalence of T2DM, estimated at 366 million cases in 2011, will increase to 552 million by the year 2030. Equally alarming is the predicted increase in diabetes cases in China from 90 to 129.7 million over the same period.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> T2DM increases the risk of onset of all reported diabetes-associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, blindness, amputation, etc. by years to decades. However, such problems can be imminently addressed by consideration of the root causes of T2DM. Although T2DM is universally known to be associated with a genetic predisposition and is increasingly diagnosed in younger patients, the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease remains insufficient.\nSingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of DNA sequence deviations and reportedly account for approximately 90% of genetic variations in the human genome.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> SNPs theoretically can occur within any region of the human genome and those disrupting the coding region promote transcription of coding SNPs, which alter the amino acid sequences of transcribed proteins, thereby contributing to a state of disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Although genome-wide association studies have become a cutting-edge method to explore risk loci for T2DM,通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5,6]</u> SNPs only explain part of the heritability of T2DM, while the use of microRNA (miRNA), as only one aspect of epigenetic approaches, may be more appropriate to establish intimate correlations between genetic backgrounds and environmental factors. Therefore, elucidation of the interface between SNPs and miRNAs may be a reasonable approach to interpret the mechanism as well.\nMicroRNAs are a class of endogenous small noncoding, but functional, RNA molecules composed of 18–24 nucleotides. The generally accepted view of miRNA biogenesis is that primary miRNA transcripts are cleaved to stem-loop intermediates, known as pre-miRNAs, in the nucleus by the RNase III enzyme Drosha. These pre-miRNAs are then subsequently transported to the cytoplasm and lysed by the cytoplasmic RNase III enzyme dicer to generate mature miRNAs, although expression of these molecules might be affected by any of several aspects of this intermediate process. Nonetheless, miRNAs typically degrade or directly suppress translation of target genes by specific complementary base-pairing to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the target mRNA to regulate multiple pathways, such as cell death, cell proliferation, embryonic development, and metabolic processes.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,9]</u> It has been suggested that miRNAs may regulate translation of more than one-third of human genomic mRNAs. Recent studies have shown that gain or loss of miRNA function contributes to the onset of T2DM. For example, miR-27a expression was found to be up-regulated in adipose tissue of a spontaneous rat model of T2DM and circulating levels were found to be increased in patients diagnosed with metabolic syndrome and T2DM.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u> Moreover, serum miR-9, miR-29a, miR-30d, miR-34a, miR-124a, miR-146a, and miR-375 levels in T2DM were found to be significantly elevated compared to a normal glucose tolerance group and up-regulation five compared to a prediabetes group.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Compared with healthy controls, circulating miRNA-146a levels were significantly up-regulated in patients newly diagnosed with T2DM.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> However, a previous study reported a negative correlation between downregulation of miR-146a expression and that of the target gene tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance, poor glycemic control, several proinflammatory cytokine genes, and circulatory levels of TNF-α and interleukin-6.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms in miRNAs are emerging as an innovative method to alter functional polymorphisms present in the human genome to interfere with the function of miRNAs. For example, the presence of rs2910164 in pre-miR-146a affects miRNA expression levels and leads to a genetic predisposition to papillary thyroid carcinoma.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> A recent study verified correlations among 13 candidate loci derived from the literature and computational data regarding T2DM susceptibility that identified the mutated allele of rs895819 in miR-27a and rs531564 in miR-124a, but not rs2910164 in miR-146a, were relevant to T2DM onset in Italian nationals.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> However, these three SNPs have not been reported in Chinese diabetic patients, and their study did not address the correlations between gene mutations and clinical phenotypes. Therefore, in this case–control study, we replicated the effects of these three polymorphisms on T2DM susceptibility in a larger Han population from Northern China, which suggest the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of these SNPs of miRNA.\nWe recruited 995 newly diagnosed T2DM patients and 967 controls aged 20–79 years from September 2009 to September 2013. The patients were from the endocrine inpatient and outpatient clinic of the Second Affiliated Hospital at Harbin Medical University (Harbin, China) and controls were recruited from the physical examination center in the same hospital. A standard diagnosis of T2DM was in accordance with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dl) or a 2-hour postglucose level ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dl) by either a random elevated fasting glucose value on more than one occasion or an oral glucose tolerance test. The duration of newly diagnosed T2DM was shorter than 6 months, and patients who used oral medications or insulin injections to achieve adequate glucose control were excluded from this study. All patients routinely underwent arterial Doppler ultrasound electrocardiography, as well as nerve conduction velocity and ophthalmic examinations, to identify complications of T2DM. For elimination of prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance), we recruited controls with an FPG level of ≤ 5.1 mmol/L (91.8 mg/dl) at the same time as a HbA1c level of <6.0%. Exclusion criteria were the presence of malignancies, nephropathy, severe liver disease, and autoimmune diseases. To exclude type 1 diabetes patients, we tested for glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody and insulin autoantibody, otherwise, we attempted to eliminate gestational and type-specific diabetes.\nThe age and sex of the study subjects were recorded and blood pressure, circumference of the waist and hips, height, and weight were measured by trained medical staff. Approximately 2 ml of venous blood was collected from all subjects via venipuncture into tubes containing sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and then stored at −20°C. Levels of lipids, FPG, fasting insulin (FINS), C-peptide, and HbA1c were determined by physicians from two affiliated hospitals. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height2 (kg/m2); homeostasis model assessment of β cell function (HOMA-β) was calculated as 20 × FINS (mIU/L)/FPG (mmol/L)- 3.5(%); homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IS) was calculated as 1/(FPG (mmol/L) × FINS (mIU/L); and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated as FPG (mmol/L) × FINS (mIU/L)/22.5. The aim of the study was explained to each of the participants and all consented to donate blood samples and the use of the collected demographic and physiologic data.\nWe obtained miR-27a (rs895819), miR-124a (rs531564), and miR-146a (rs2910164) as previously described.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Our previous analysis of 13 miRNAs as candidate genes showed that there were no correlations between SNPs in 11 miRNAs associated with T2DM, with the exception of a protective effect of the mutated GG genotype of rs895819 in miR-27a and a risk effect of the mutated GG genotype of rs531564 in miR-124a. We chose miR-146a as a target in our investigation and found that the C allele in miR-146a (rs2910164) was associated with a lower risk of diabetic polyneuropathy.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> We also considered racial and ethnic differences in miRNA expression profiles and gene polymorphic genetic variants.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u>\nGenomic DNA was extracted from all blood samples using the TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co. Ltd. Beijing, China). The quality and concentration of DNA were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA). We used SNPscan minisequencing to identify SNPs. SNP genotyping was performed using a custom-by-design 48-Plex SNPscan Kit (catalog no.: G0104K; Genesky Biotechnologies Inc. Shanghai, China) according to methods described by Chen et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> This kit was an SNP genotyping technology patented by Genesky Biotechnologies, Inc. based on the ligase and multiplex fluorescence polymerase chain reactions.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>\nFor quality control, each SNP in the control population was assessed for conformity to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium using the Pearson’s Chi-squared test. SNPs with a P < 0.05 were excluded from further analysis. Categorical data are presented as frequencies (percentages) and continuous variables as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Student’s t-test was used to identify differences among quantitative variables and the Chi-squared test was used for comparisons of categorical variables of basic characteristics and genotype frequencies in cases and controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess correlations between genotypes and risks of T2DM by logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and BMI. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe characteristics of T2DM cases and controls are shown in Table 1. There were no obvious differences in gender and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between the two groups (P > 0.05). Of the studied basic characteristics, significant differences existed for age, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, FPG, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), FINS, HbAlc, HOMA-β, HOMA-IS, and HOMA-IR (all, P < 0.05).

Furthermore, females with the GC genotype of rs531564 had a lower risk of T2DM (P = 0.014; OR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.49–0.92), but we observed that this result changed after correction for age, gender, and BMI (adjusted, P = 0.060; OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.51–1.02).

Until recently, causative factors of T2DM have remained elusive. It is now widely recognized that a combination of environmental and genetic factors contribute to the onset and progression of T2DM. Therefore, analysis of miRNAs and SNPs could explain the associations between genetic variations and clinical phenotypes of disease to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the efficacy of targeted therapies.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report correlations of miR-27a, miR-124a, and miR-146a polymorphisms with T2DM among the Han population of northern China. Our observations of 995 Chinese T2DM patients and 967 controls were in contrast with the results of a study of 163 Italian cases and 185 healthy controls. In our study, there were no visible differences in association analysis of mutational alleles and T2DM, while the Italian study found that the G allele of rs895819 conveyed a significant protective effect, while the G allele of rs531564 was associated with an increased risk of T2DM, but rs2910164 in miR-146a was not significantly correlation with disease onset, as indicated by our results.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> One possible reason for these contradictory findings may be due to differences in sample size, ethnicity of subjects, geographic locations, and T2DM-associated miRNAs and SNPs. A recent report suggested that up-regulated miR-144 expression was closely correlated to T2D onset among Swedes (OR = 2.43, P = 0.035), but not Iraqis.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Frequencies of mutant alleles in Mendelian disorders are influenced by race and ethnic backgrounds, and genetic polymorphisms have been strongly correlated with race and ethnic backgrounds.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Previous studies reported differences in associations between the G allele of rs11196218 and the incidence of T2DM between southern and northern Chinese population,通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u> similar to those between Italian and Chinese populations.\nAlthough our findings revealed that the mutated alleles were not significantly associated with T2DM, the GRS was calculated to assess the effect of multiple candidate loci on disease onset. However, the GRS was not significantly associated with T2DM, but apparently had an effect on TC, which exists in the blood in the form of lipoproteins. Evidence clearly indicates that cholesterol regulates the function and survival of β-cells, and HDL-C regulates insulin sensitization, which are generally recognized as important pathogenic mechanisms in T2DM.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26,27]</u> We also found that TC in cases was distinctly higher than in controls. Therefore, we reasoned that these three gene loci were important susceptibility candidates for T2DM in the Chinese population.\nMoreover, our stratified data showed that the genotype GC of rs531564 in miR-124a alleviated the risk of T2DM among younger persons (age < 45 years) and the genotype CC of rs895819 in miR-27a elevated the risk of T2DM in an overweight group (24 ≤ BMI < 28 kg/m2). This evidence indicates that the miR-27a might suppress adipocyte differentiation by blockade of the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, which are extremely important regulators of adipogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> In the latter experiment, PPAR-γ was shown to be a direct target gene of miR-27a.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> Moreover, miR-27a expression was strongly and positively correlated with fasting glucose level.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Moreover, overexpression of miR-124a2 was involved in the regulation of pancreatic development and reduced insulin secretion by directly targeting forkhead box a2 mRNA.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> In addition, up-regulation of miR-124a decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by directly targeting Rab GTPase family 27a and rabphilin-3A-like.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Current evidence indicates that the mutated allele of rs895819 in miR-27a decreased the risk of gastric cancer via mature miR-27a and its target gene zinc finger and BTB domain containing 10.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Although there was no correlation between rs531564 in miR-124 and Alzheimer’s disease in a Mongolian population, this SNP site also changed expression levels of mature miR-124.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> Therefore, we reasoned that SNPs in rs895819 or rs531564 also influenced expression levels of mature miR-27a or miR-124a and their targets in the dysregulation of adipocyte differentiation, pancreatic development, and insulin secretion. However, there was no pronounced association between obese patients who carried genotype CC of rs895819 and T2DM. Based on the observed variations in circulating miRNA with altered insulin sensitization,通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> we speculated that miRNA profiles might change with weight gain from the status of overweight to obese. However, further studies are needed to validate this hypothesis. Therefore, our next study will explore correlations between SNPs in human miRNA and expression levels of mature miRNAs and functions of these miRNAs in the onset of T2DM among the Chinese Han population.\nMicroRNAs are attractive drug targets because they regulate expression levels of many important proteins and multiple cellular pathways. MiR-122 is highly abundant in the liver, and abnormal expression levels are closely related to many liver-related diseases. Besides, a recent study showed that miRNA inhibition acted to suppress hepatitis C viremia for extended periods.通用删除6(英):<u>[35,36,37]</u> In addition, a SNP 829C-T near the miR-24 binding site in the 3′ UTR of dihydrofolate reductase was closely associated with methotrexate resistance by interfering with miR-24 function,通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> while SNPs in miRNAs lead to altered expression levels and functions of miRNA, resulting in an increased risk of illness.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,32]</u> Thus, miRNA mimics or inhibitors are extensively used in a clinical setting.\nIn conclusion, the work presented here demonstrated that rs895819 in miR-27a and rs531564 in miR-124a were significantly associated with T2DM in overweight (24 ≤ BMI < 28 kg/m2) and younger (age <45 years) groups of the Han population in northern China. The genotype CC of rs895819 in miR-27a was associated with an increased risk of T2DM, while genotype GC of rs531564 in miR-124a conveyed a protective effect, and miR-146a (rs2910164) was not associated with these traits in any stratification analysis. We speculated that SNPs in miRNAs possibly participate in the regulation of mature miRNA and mRNA targets. These observations provide evidence of the genetic mechanisms of miRNA polymorphisms in T2DM.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

All subjects were given pure tone stimuli 50 times, 150 pairs of Chinese words(meaning related or unrelated)auditory stimuli, and pure tone stimuli subsequently 50 times. Evoked response fields time locked to the pure tone and Chinese words were recorded using a whole-head neuromagnetometer in real-time.

The data obtained by MEG were superimposed on MRI, using a GE Signa 1. 5T system.\n\n【2】Results\nMEG, showed there were two obviously higher magnetic waves named M50 and M100, which were localized in the bilateral transverse temporal gyri in all subjects. The responses to the pairs of Chinese words(meaning related or unrelated)were similar in the same hemisphere of the same subjects. There was a higher peak during 300-600 ms in the right hemisphere of one left handed subject, but no peak in the left hemisphere, indicating that the language dominant hemisphere was localized in the right hemisphere. Superimposing the MEG data on MRI, the language area was localized in the Wernicke's areas. A 300-600 ms response peak was obsarved in each hemisphere(the amplitude of the 300-600 ms response peak in each hemisphere was almost the same)in two right-handed subjects, showing that the language area was localized in the 2 hemispheres in the two subjects. There was one peak in each hemisphere(300-600 ms response)in 6 subjects, but the amplitude of the wave in the left hemisphere in the 6 subjects was much higher than that in the right hemisphere. By choosing randomly from the later component(300-600 ms response)several time points and superimposing them on MRI, all time points were localized in the posterior part of the superior temporal gyri, which is the Wernicke's areas.\n\n【3】Conclusions\nComparing with the later component of the bilateral hemispheres, the wave amplitude in the language dominant hemisphere was much higher than that in the non-language dominant hemisphere.

A previous study verified that the biostructure of this scaffold was very similar to natural human bone with both porosity and perfect biodegradability, which should make it possible for the scaffold to become an ideal antibiotics carrier for the repair of infected bony defects.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Although it was theoretically demonstrated that all of the scaffold monomers and degradation products had no significant toxicity or side effects to the human body,通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u> the scaffold would undergo changes and reactions during procedures including fabrication, storage, and sterilization. Furthermore, the blood concentration of the loaded antibiotics could reach toxic levels at certain times, especially in the early stages after implantation. Therefore, according to the ISO rules for medical implant biosafety, the biosafety of the scaffold was systematically evaluated by toxicity tests in vitro and in vivo in the present study, to provide a reference for subsequent clinical applications.\nVancomycin (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA)-loaded PLGA microspheres were prepared by an emulsification-solvent evaporation method, and then incorporated into the BHA/PAA scaffold using a homogeneous system method involving a diffusion control system. After curing molding, the scaffold was finally molded into cuboid granules with a size of 1.5 cm × 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm, containing 8 wt% of vancomycin. For preparation of vancomycin-loaded poly (methyl methacrylate) (V-PMMA), 80 mg of vancomycin was mixed with 920 mg of bone cement powder (DePuy Synthes Company, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA), before 1 ml of MMA monomer solution (DePuy Synthes Company, New Brunswick) was added and stirred carefully. Before curing, V-PMMA was molded into the same size and shape as V-BHA/PAA. The final content of vancomycin was also equal to 8 wt%.\nThe in vitro experiments included a V-BHA/PAA group (VC group), vancomycin-unloaded BHA/PAA group (VUC group), negative control group (NC group), and positive control group (PC group). The in vivo tests involved a VC group, VUC group, blank control (BC) group (only debridement without implants), and PC group (V-PMMA). In serum biochemical tests, the PC group was not included, while in blood drug concentration measurements, the VUC group was excluded. Fifteen New Zealand white rabbits (Animal Experimental Center, Chongqing Medical University, China) were involved in each group.\nLeaching solutions for the V-BHA/PAA and BHA/PAA scaffolds were obtained following ISO 10993-5 standards by immersing the respective scaffolds in 1640 culture solution at 37°C for 3 days. L929 fibroblasts (National Engineering Research Center of Ultrasound Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, China) were cultured for 2 days, and then digested with 0.25% trypsin to prepare a cell suspension at 6 × 104 cells/ml. The suspension was inoculated into a 96-well plate at 100 μl/well, with 8 wells per group, and the plate was incubated in a 5% CO2 constant temperature incubator 删除2：<u>(LRB MODEL 2300; Sheldon Company, USA)</u> at 37°C for 24 h to allow the cells attach to the wells. The culture medium was then replaced, and the cells were cultured for a further 24 h. After the culture medium was discarded, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, before 100 μl of leaching solution for the VC and VUC groups, 100 μl of 0.64% phenol solution for the PC group, or 100 μl of fresh culture medium for the NC group was added. After culture for 2, 4, and 7 days, respectively, the cellular morphology was observed under an inverted microscope (CKX41-A32PH, Olympus, Japan). MTT solution was then added to each well and incubated for 6 h, followed by addition of 150 μl of dimethylsulfoxide. After shaking for 10 min, the absorbance (A) values of the wells were detected using an immune enzyme-labeled instrument (Elx-808; Bio-Tek, USA) at a wavelength of 470 nm. The relative growth rate (RGR) of L929 cells was calculated according to the formula shown below, and the cytotoxicity of the leaching solutions was evaluated by the average RGR according to the grading criteria listed in Table 1.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nGrading criteria for cytotoxicity\n删除重复语句：<u>Grading criteria for cytotoxicity</u>\nRGR: Relative growth rate.\nEluates from the V-BHA/PAA and BHA/PAA scaffolds were obtained by immersing the scaffolds in normal saline (10 ml/3 cm2 surface area) and incubation at 37°C for 1 day. The eluates were disinfected using a microporous filter before being assayed. Blood collection was performed by heart puncture of New Zealand white rabbits, followed by immediate addition of 0.5 ml of 20 g/L potassium oxalate to prepare noncoagulant blood. The noncoagulant blood was diluted with normal saline (10 ml of normal saline per 8 ml of blood), before addition of leaching solution, normal saline (NC group), or double-distilled water (PC group) according to the groups. After gentle shaking and centrifugation at 2500 r/min for 5 min, the A value of each supernatant was measured using a spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer-Lamar II; PerkinElmer, Germany) at a wavelength of 545 nm. The hemolysis ratio was calculated using the formula shown below, by which the biosafety of V-BHA/PAA and BHA/PAA for hemolysis was determined according to the ISO standard (eligible if hemolysis ratio was <5%).\nA chronic osteomyelitis model in the right proximal tibia of New Zealand white rabbits was established based on a previously reported method.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> All of the rabbits were classified according to gross observation and X-ray detection criteria.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> Only the rabbits with class 2 and above were chosen to perform bacterial culture and identification using affected bone marrow. Only the rabbits with infected bacteria confirmed to coincide with the initially seeded bacteria ultimately became the experimental models. After general anesthesia by intravenous injection of 3% pentobarbital (1 ml/kg body weight), the infected tibial metaphysis was exposed through a primary incision approach to debride all of the dead bone and septic tissues. Finally, a 2.0 cm × 1.0 cm bone defect was made, debrided thoroughly and lavaged 3 times, and implanted with 3 g of V-BHA/PAA, BHA/PAA, or V-PMMA according to the groups. The NC group did not receive an implant. The general conditions, motion conditions, and deaths were recorded on each postoperative day. Blood aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) levels were checked preoperatively and at postoperative week 1, week 2, and month 1 to evaluate the influence of the scaffolds on the functions of the liver and kidney. Furthermore, the blood concentrations of vancomycin were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除2：<u>(Model 1200; Agilent, Japan)</u> at postoperative day 3, week 1, week 2, and month 1. In addition, the liver and kidney tissues were harvested on the last experimental day to observe the histopathological changes under microscopy after hematoxylin and eosin staining.\nStatistical analysis was conducted by SPSS . At first, F-test was used to test variance homogeneity of every group and then least significant difference (LSD) method was used to analyze the results of cytotoxicity assay and acute hemolytic test in vitro, while two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to analyze the results of toxicity assay in vivo meanwhile LSD test was also applied to compare any two groups. Values of P < 0.05 were regarded as significant.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the RGR of L929 cells in the VC and VUC groups was above 85% on every experimental day. Therefore, the cytotoxicity grades of V-BHA/PAA and BHA/PAA-based on the RGR values were all below 1. When compared with the PC group, the RGR of L929 cells in the VC and VUC groups was significantly higher on each experimental day. However, when compared with the NC group, the RGR became relative lower at day 2, and thereafter increased until it became equal to the NC group on day 7. Under the inverted phase-contrast microscope, as showed in Figure 2, the morphocytology of L929 cells in the VC and VUC groups was as normal as that in the NC group.\nAs shown in Table 2, the hemolysis ratios of the V-BHA/PAA and BHA/PAA scaffolds were 2.27% and 1.42%, respectively. As both values were below 5%, the hemolysis safety of V-BHA/PAA and BHA/PAA was considered to meet the standard of ISO 10993-5.\nHemolytic ratio of each group (mean ± SD, n = 5)\n删除重复语句：<u>Hemolytic ratio of each group (mean ± SD, n = 5)</u>\nVC group versus VUC group: No statistical difference; VC group versus NC group: Had statistical difference; VC group versus PC group: Had statistical difference; SD: Standard deviation.\nWithin the 1st postoperative week, all animals showed inactivity with limping and wound swelling without significant chills, cyanosis, or dyspnea. Thereafter, the activity of most animals in the VC and PC groups gradually recovered with weight increases. Two animals in the VUC group and three animals in the BC group died because of severe infection verified by autopsy. No animals died in the VC and PC groups.\nAs shown in Table 3 and Table 4, there were no significant differences between the experimental groups (VC group and VUC group) and the control group for not only liver function (AST and ALT levels), but also kidney function (BUN and Cr levels) at each time point examined.\nSerum AST and ALT level (mean ± SD, U/L, n = 5)\n删除重复语句：<u>Serum AST and ALT level (mean ± SD, U/L, n = 5)</u>\nThere was no significant difference between each pair of experimental and control groups at each time point (AST: F = 2.13, P = 0.28; ALT: F = 5.15, P = 0.15), and also no obvious difference between each pair of time points at VC group (AST: F = 5.89, P = 0.16; ALT: F = 0.51, P = 0.66).

SD: Standard deviation.\nAt 1 month postoperatively, the blood drug concentration in the VC group was slightly higher than that in the PC group.\nUnder microscopic examination, as shown in Figure 3, the liver and kidney tissues in the experimental groups showed normal appearances without significant differences compared with the control groups.\nThe BHA/PAA scaffold is a novel curable and biodegradable porous bone restorative material, which was researched and developed by us in association with Sichuan Guona Science and Technology Co. Ltd.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Among the active ingredients, BHA is an extremely bone-like hydroxyapatite that has been proven to be nontoxic and show favorable biocompatibility with the human body.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> PAA is a polymer of six amino acids (6-aminocaproic acid, glycine, L-alanine, L-phenylalanine, L-proline, and L-lysine) that also shows biodegradability and biocompatibility with the human body.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> The BHA/PAA scaffold is a composite of BHA and PAA materials, which perfectly combines the favorable mechanical property of BHA with the biocompatibility and biodegradability of PAA. By adjusting the proportions of BHA and PAA, the rate and speed of the scaffold degradation can be adjusted, meaning that the scaffold should have great potential for bone repair and as a drug carrier. Preliminary experiments initially demonstrated that the BHA/PAA scaffold had good biosafety and biocompatibility, and could be degraded completely in vivo and replaced by bone tissue.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The scaffold produced degradation products in vivo that included near-neutral oligopeptides and amino acid molecules or underwent further degradation to carbon dioxide and water, which are all nontoxic to the human body.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,9]</u>\nIn this study, vancomycin was encapsulated as drug-loaded microspheres synthesized with PLGA, which is a degradable macromolecular organic compound randomly polymerized by lactic acid and glycolic acid. As reported in the literature, PLGA possesses favorable features of biocompatibility, nontoxicity, and ease of creation into sacciform or membrane structures.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> In addition, if ester bonds in its chemical structure are disrupted, it can be degraded in vivo to lactic acid and glycolic acid,通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> which are normal catabolites in the human body. Consequently, PLGA is commonly considered to have excellent biosafety and has been extensively applied in the pharmaceutical, medical engineering, and modern industrial fields. In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the clinical application of PLGA, and formally included PLGA in the USA pharmacopoeia as a pharmaceutical excipient.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Recently, PLGA has been widely used for controlled drug release because of its desirable biocompatibility and biosafety as well as its lack of obvious disintegration phenomenon.\nAs an antimicrobial glycopeptide, vancomycin is always one of the most common antibiotics for treatment of Staphylococcus aureus, especially methicillin-resistant S. aureus,通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> and has been used extensively in orthopedics since the late 1950s. However, vancomycin can manifest obvious systemic toxicity toward the human body if applied by intravenous injection for a long period,通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u> for which nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity are the most common effects (incidence of approximately 12–43%).通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> The toxicity of vancomycin shows a significant dose- and time-dependence. Briefly, the toxicity increases as the blood drug concentration and application time increase. Currently, it is generally accepted that the initial blood trough level of a drug is the most important predictive index of toxicity, and the corresponding level of vancomycin is 60 mg/L.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> Owing to the obvious systemic toxicity by systemic administration, local application of vancomycin is increasingly being adopted to decrease the toxic side effects.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18]</u>\nUse of an antimicrobial-loaded bone tissue engineering scaffold is the most common controlled release system for local antibiotics to treat an infectious bone defect, because a scaffold can clearly improve the bioavailability of antibiotics and accordingly decrease their absorption into the bloodstream, thereby minimizing the toxicity and side effects of the drugs.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> However, in general, the procedure for a drug-loaded release system to deliver a drug in vivo involves an initial burst release process within 24 h of implantation before stable release, during which time the blood drug concentration can instantly achieve its highest level, and easily result in a toxic response. Furthermore, with prolongation of the drug-release time, the stable release procedure can lead to drug accumulation in the bloodstream, which can also produce toxic effects.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Therefore, according to the ISO rules concerning medical implant biosafety, we conducted toxicity tests in vitro and in vivo to systematically evaluate the biosafety of the V-BHA/PAA scaffold to provide a reference for subsequent clinical applications. Through cytotoxicity tests in vitro, we found that the V-BHA/PAA scaffold could influence the growth of L929 fibroblasts initially, but not cause cell death directly, and thus the cellular morphology remained normal. Thereafter, the effect of the scaffold to promote cell proliferation became stronger and stronger as time passed, by which the cell growth inhibition could be compensated effectively. The hemolysis test demonstrated that the V-BHA/PAA scaffold had eligible hemolysis biosafety following ISO standards. Through the toxicity test in vivo, we found that the blood concentration of vancomycin after implantation of V-BHA/PAA was far below its toxic concentration (60 mg/L) throughout the test period. Moreover, the function and histomorphology of the liver and kidney all showed normal appearances, just like those in the NC group and PC group (V-PMMA material), which has been used widely in the clinic.\nIn conclusion, according to ISO standards, the V-BHA/PAA scaffold is considered to have sufficient safety for clinical utilization.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81171685)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The proliferative potency of K562 cells and HL60 cells was detected using MTT colorimetric assay, Typan blue dye exclusion method, colony formation test. The proliferative potency of normal hematopoietic cells was evaluated using mixture colony -forming unit (CFU-Mix), granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM), and erythrocyte colony-forming unit (CFU-E) assays. K562 cells were mixed with normal mononuclear cells(MNCs) at ratios of 1: 100 and 1: 1000 for creating the model of simulated remission bone marrow. Colony formation test and nested-RT-PCR were carried out to detect the residual K562 cells in cell mixture.\n\n【2】Results\nAfter a 5-hour incubation with ZnPcS2P2, the content of ZnPcS2P2 in normal MNCs was the lowest value. At the same time, the content in K562 cells and HL60 cells was very high. Therefore, the time point was selected as the optimal one for irradiating the cell suspensions. ZnPc-PDT could significantly kill proliferative K562 cells and HL60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentration of 1. 0 (μg/ml, the inhibitory rate of ZnPc-PDT on the colony formation was 100% for K562 cells, 89. 7% for HL60 cells. 0. 25 μg/ml ZnPc-PDT could completely photoinactivate residual K562 cells in the simulated remission bone marrow. Under an identical condition, the inhibitory rates of CFU-Mix, CFU-GM, CFU-E were 18. 0%, 18. 6%, and 17. 8% respectively.\n\n【3】Conclusion\nZnPc-PDT appears to be a promising approach for bone marrow purging.

However, there is no gold standard to evaluate their effectiveness.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Some appraised the results according to the senior consultants’ assessment通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> while the others evaluate the journal clubs according to an attendee’s self-report survey.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,4]</u> The form of journal club varies; and a well-accepted assessment system has yet been established.\nWe have modified the journal club into a feedback system to ensure maximum learning experience. Participants were encouraged to express their views on each article and open discussion among peers and supervisors were shaped. The estimated effects of the modified feedback journal club (FJC) were formulated based on the number of total publication and participant’s survey.\nEver since August 2014, a weekly FJC has been hosted in the Department of Plastic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Each predetermined presenter selected a recent article 1-week prior. The selection of article had to be approved by a senior supervisor to ensure quality. One or two articles were discussed and at least two of the three senior supervisors must be present during each meeting.\nThe subjects of this research were young doctors in the Department of Plastic Surgery, including plastic surgical residents and doctoral/master degree students majoring in plastic surgery. Basic information such as the names of the presenter, attendees, discussion topic, and source of article were logged.\nTwo kinds of feedback modes were applied in the journal club. The first feedback form was received from peers and supervisors, followed by an open discussion. The presenters critically assessed the article according to the suggested peer-review guidelines通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> and shared deeper insights gained from the article for 15 min. The supervisors took charge of the open discussion; summarized all the diverse viewpoints and opinions based on their own research experience. At last, a consensus would be reached on whether/how to write a letter to the editor when suggestions were considered worthy.\nOur journal club has included a segment called \"experience from the first authors.\" The first authors were invited for a face-to-face communication. The invited authors included: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> those in the Department of Plastic Surgery who have published a research article; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Chinese authors who may not specialize in plastic surgery but recently published an article with a high impact factor; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> prestigious foreign professors specialized in plastic surgery. These authors were invited to share their experience in clinical or/and experimental research and presented their recent publication step-by-step.\nThe publications of participants as the first author were documented. Publications were divided into three categories: Chinese articles, Science Citation Index (SCI) articles, and SCI letters. The relationship between the times of participants’ attendance and the number of their publications was analyzed.\nA confidential online survey for the quality evaluation of FJC was distributed to all participants in January 2017 through WeChat. The questionnaire consisted of 25 questions, covering participants’ basic information and Likert-scale questions.\nA total of 113 times of FJC were held in 2.5 years, with a mean of 18.1 ± 6.4 participants attended each meeting. There were 29 participants who met our inclusion criteria as young doctors in the Department of Plastic Surgery. A total of 67 papers (29 in 2015 and 38 in 2016) were published, including 9 Chinese articles (2 in 2015 and 7 in 2016), 31 SCI letters (17 in 2015 and 14 in 2016), and 27 SCI articles (10 in 2015 and 17 in 2016). A positive correlation (R2 = 0.71) was revealed between the times of FJC attendance and the number of publications (P < 0.01). All the 29 participants (16 males, 13 females) were asked to complete the survey within a 3-day period. Most of them were doctoral (14, 48.3%) and master (10, 34.5%) students of Peking Union Medical College. The rest (5, 17.2%) were residents. Participants at the age of 25–30 years made up the largest group (23, 79.3%), followed by those <25 years old (4, 13.8%), and those 31–35 years old (2, 6.9%). Not all of the participants were available for each attendance due to clinical work. Favorably, 21 participants (72.4%) attended more than half of the meetings. Among all, the 18 questions answered with Likert-scale scores, the most satisfied items were \"the format of journal club organization\" (4.44 ± 0.61), gains from the \"experience from the first authors\" section (4.41 ± 0.66), \"peer-review checklist\" provided for article analysis (4.38 ± 0.70), \"skills of medical manuscript writing\" (4.35 ± 0.60), and \"enhanced critical thinking\" (4.35 ± 0.65).\nJournal club provides a forum to discuss new innovations and promotes improvement of clinical care, as well as to stimulate future research endeavors. In this research, a weekly journal club has been run for 3 years. The original format was like a closed-door lecture, which hampered its educational purpose. The holdup was similar to the previous studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> The two most common obstacles faced were the limited experience shared and the lack of time. A novel approach was introduced aiming to gain perspectives and interactions. As most participants were students or junior surgeons, inadequate knowledge, and clinical experience demanded inputs from senior supervisors. For questions that could not be answered first hand, original authors of the discussed articles would be reached through a letter format or a face-to-face discussion. Twenty-six out of the 34 accepted letters were inquired, and the original authors responded with satisfactory answers in 21 out of 26 letters.\nMedicine is rapidly advancing, finding a cost-effective method for teaching critical appraisal is challenging. Green and Johnson通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> were frontiers to teach critical appraisal and writing skills in a letter-to-editor manner. Participants were most pleased with this novel format; and we have had 34 letters published, which was a satisfactory result indicating progressive academic communication. However, further impact on medicine and research practice is still targeted. Participants without literature experience were advised to start from a letter first. Although only exemplary letters would be submitted for publication, skills were equally trained with the help of supervisors and peers. Numbers of participants have expressed that after several letter acceptance, they felt more confident and ambitious for future publications. At this time, they were encouraged to initiate their own research, ranging from systemic review, meta-analysis, experimental research, or clinical trial. Through the accumulation of knowledge and publication experience, the total publication within our journal club was 94.\nTime is another barrier that should not be neglected.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> As clinical practitioners, lack of time and time management are the key challenges. However, a platform for expressing ideas, communicating with peers and supervisors, initiating motivation, and generating benign competitions among peers are the reasons why they attend the FJC willingly despite heavy clinical work. What is inspiring is that most \"senior\" participants with more than 1-year experience in the journal club have achieved publications. Furthermore, the participants’ number of publications was positively correlated to the amount of attendance. Since there was no compulsory requirement on publication, all of the achievements were self-driven. Thus, publication could be a reliable and objective measurement for journal club evaluation.\nIn this research, the \"journal club organization\" earned the highest score, reflecting that this form of FJC was accepted. Not only did participants practice critical thinking and manuscript writing during the process, feedbacks from several sources had also benefited. The \"experience from the first authors\" was popular among participants, due to first-hand answers directly from the author. The lowest scored items were also acknowledged, and further improvements will be made in the future. Not everyone got to present every quarter; thus some participants have yet developed a regular reading habit. However, most of them reported that they would browse the topic, and read beyond the abstracts for the interesting topic. This was a good method of knowledge acquisition in a limited time. However, participants were not satisfied with statistical and English improvement. A multidisciplinary form, including the presence of biostatisticians and professional English medical editors, could be introduced later to better enhance discussion.\nIn conclusion, over the implementation of FJC, participants have received feedbacks from peers, supervisors and most importantly, original authors through multiple approaches. We have observed a significant improvement in both quantity and quality of participants’ publications. Anonymous survey has confirmed that the modified form of FJC was well accepted by the attendees, which was further proved to be an effective method to promote participants’ research ability with measurable outcomes.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by a grant from the Education Reforming Program, Peking Union Medical College 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2015zlgc0111)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Fifty-two isolated hearts of 3-4 week-old immature rabbits were divided into 4 groups randomly. During ischemia, 3 different cardioplegic solutions were administered intermittently by infusion every 15 min (20-25 ml each time in all groups).

{"seq_id": "bac783cd-4d3c-418d-b43f-7b9861445661", "title": "", "text": "【0】Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality. It affects 0.50-1.1 million patients in China each year 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>, and the median 1-month case mortality is 40%, among which many survivors remain severely disabled 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The most common location of ICH is the basal ganglia 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. However, despite the high frequency of ICH within the basal ganglia, its treatment strategy remains controversial among neurosurgeons and neurologists 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\nSurgery has the potential to improve neurological recovery of ICH because early mass removal might reduce nervous tissue damage, possibly by relieving local ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[5, 6, 7]</u> or the removal of noxious chemicals 通用删除6(英):<u>[8, 9]</u>. Nonetheless, the effect of surgery does not seem to be homogeneous, with expert opinion, mechanistic reasoning, and trial data all indicating that early surgery benefits only some particular clots. Thus, most neurosurgeons would not remove a small ICH in the internal capsule or basal ganglia because its surgical approach path is too close to the motion-conducting regions.\nSeveral prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were undertaken during the previous four decades to compare the outcome of early surgery with conservative treatment, the results of which were neutral 通用删除6(英):<u>[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]</u>. The results of a subgroup analysis from the International Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (STICH) indicated that patients with spontaneous ICH in the basal ganglia show no overall advantage from early surgery when compared with initial conservative treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. However, these trials had enrolled only small numbers of patients from China. A randomized controlled trial in China demonstrated improvements in independent survival in minimally invasive surgically treated patients with small basal ganglion hemorrhages 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\nTraditional craniotomy is generally used to remove hematomas. A large flap is created, and the brain is exposed, detached, and manipulated to inspect the site of bleeding, and the blood can be suctioned and hemostasis applied to multiple areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. With the development of neurosurgery and the updating of surgical instruments, the efficacy of craniotomy is worth investigating. The aim of this trial was to determine whether craniotomy evacuation would improve outcomes compared with conservative treatment in patients with small basal ganglion intracerebral hemorrhages (volume ≤40 ml) in China.\nConsecutive patients with acute spontaneous ICH (<24 h) were retrospectively enrolled from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang Province, China, between January 2018 and August 2019. A diagnosis of ICH was confirmed by computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head and was made according to the diagnostic criteria of the guidelines for the management of ICH 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\nPatients were eligible if 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> they had a diagnosis of ICH and treated in the neurosurgery department; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> their hematoma was located in the basal ganglia (internal or external capsule, caudate nucleus, putamen, or more than one of the abovementioned structures); 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the hematoma volume was between 25 and 40 mL; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> 40 ≤ age ≤75 years; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> the patients reached the hospital within 24 h of ictus, whereas they were ineligible if 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the hemorrhage was induced by an aneurysm, angiographically proven arteriovenous malformation, infarction, trauma, or tumor; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the hemorrhage originated from the cerebellum, brainstem, or lobes; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> they had severe pre-existing physical or mental disabilities or comorbidities that could interfere with the assessment of their outcomes; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> they had coagulation disorders; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> they had a prior history of stroke with neurological deficits; or 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> patients who needed urgent evacuation because of a hernia.\nDemographics, medical history, medication, the time between ictus and arrival at the emergency department, and baseline clinical and radiological information were obtained from the emergency and hospitalization datasets. The baseline volume of ICH was calculated by the formula A × B × C/2 according to the CT scan 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was not included in the volume calculated. The patient’s conscious disturbance and neurological function were evaluated through the Glasgow coma score (GCS) and modified Rankin score (mRS) at the time of admission.\nPatients were divided into a surgery group and a conservative treatment group according to the treatment they received. For patients in the surgery group, the hematoma was carefully evacuated under direct vision through a microscope via a small penetration in the superior temporal gyrus or other noneloquent area. Decompressive craniotomy was performed if necessary. In the conservative treatment group, no invasive procedures were applied. All patients were given the best medical treatment guided by the International Recommendations 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> and if necessary, they were individualized for particular patients.\nThe primary outcome was a prognosis-based favorable or unfavorable outcome dichotomized from the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) at 12 months after ictus. GOSE was evaluated from the answers to 14 questions in a questionnaire completed by the patients or their relatives 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. The questionnaires were completed by telephone interviews conducted by independent, blinded to the treatment group interviewers.\nThe prognostic outcome was designed to be different types of outcomes with two different levels for the patient’s status 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Prognosis was estimated using the following algorithm, which had been developed from patients with a broad range of different ICH:\nPrognostic score = 10 × GCS - age - 0.64 × volume\nPatients were divided into good and poor prognosis groups using the predefined cutoff of 27.672 for supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. For patients with a poor prognosis, the outcome was regarded as favorable if GOSE was better than upper severe disability, while for patients in the good prognosis group, favorable outcomes included a good recovery and moderate disability.\nSecondary outcomes included the incidence of hospitalized complications, mortality, and prognosis-based dichotomized mRS at 12 months of follow-up. For the good prognosis group, a Rankin score of 0-2 was judged as a favorable outcome, while for those with a poor prognosis, the equivalent thresholds were three for the Rankin score. Death was stratified as an unfavorable outcome for all patients.\nMatching analysis was performed on the basis of the estimated propensity scores of observed clinical factors that may influence decision making for treatment strategy, that is, the patient’s age, GCS, volume of hematoma, and midline shift. Patients in the two groups were one-to-one matched for the similarity of their propensity score by nearest neighbor matching. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated to assess the balance detail after propensity score match (PSM). The SMD less than 0.2 was defined as acceptable matching and all the variables achieved .\nThe variables comparison before and after PSM\n删除重复语句：<u>The variables comparison before and after PSM</u>\nPSM, Propensity score match, SMD Standardized mean difference, GCS, Glasgow Coma Score\nData for categorical variables were reported as the number and percentage in each group. The percentage was reported to no decimal places. For continuous variables, the mean and SD, as well as the median, quartiles, maximum, and minimum were calculated. Quantitative data were analyzed by Student’s t test or the Mann-Whitney test depending on the distribution. Categorical data were compared by Pearson’s chi-squared test or continuous corrected χ2 tests where appropriate. Outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI.\nThe primary outcome was a simple categorical variable compared by chi-square tests for prognosis-based favorable and unfavorable outcomes on GOSE. After adjusting for the covariates GCS, volume of the hematoma, and midline shift, multivariate-adjusted binary logistic regression was performed to calculate the OR and 95% CI for the primary outcome. Secondary analysis consisted of χ2 tests for mortality and 12-month prognosis-based mRS.\nPrespecified subgroup analyses were also undertaken for age (<55, ≥55), volume of the hematoma (≤30, >30), midline shift (≤6, >6), GCS (5-8; 9-12; 13-15), IVH, status of the worse limb (weak, paralyzed), and two prognosis groups (good and poor). P values were reported to three decimal places or at P <0.0001. In this study, the statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed P value less than 0.05 (P < 0.05). The analyses were performed with SPSS 23.0 (IBM Corp.), the Stata Statistical Software Release 12.0 (College Station, TX, StataCorp LP), and R 4.1.3.\nA total of 101 patients were eligible in the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Fourteen patients were lost to follow-up, and 33 patients were excluded after the propensity score matching (PSM) for age, GCS, hematoma volume, and midline shift. This analysis, therefore, includes 54 patients, of whom 27 patients underwent evacuation . Most patients were followed-up for 12 months, except for five patients who were 1 month short. Patients’ baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1, including age, sex, neurological status, and previous medical history. The two groups seemed to be well-matched at baseline, 78% were men, and their age was between 40 and 75 years (mean 54.87±9.05 years). At admission, 26% of patients in the surgery group and 22% of patients in the conservative treatment group were in a coma (GCS ≤8) and only 22% of patients had a GCS ≥13. Paralysis of the affected limb happened in most patients in both groups (93% and 81%, respectively) . The details of the hematoma are shown in Table 3. The median volume of the hematoma was 29.5 mL (26.3-32.8 mL), and the midline shift was 5.85±1.89 mm. Ten (19%) patients had concurrent intraventricular hemorrhage. Table 4 shows the comparison of the hospitalized complications between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the overall complication rate between the two groups. Exceptionally, the incidence of pneumonia in the surgery group was significantly higher than that in the conservative treatment group (P=0.005). At 12 months, epileptic seizures had affected one patient in the conservative treatment group and 2 in the surgery group, one of whom had an intracerebral ischemic stroke at the same time.\nBaseline characteristics of the patients\n删除重复语句：<u>Baseline characteristics of the patients</u>\nFor continuous variables, data are median (IQR; range) and mean (SD); for categorical variables, data are number (%). mRS, Modified Rankin Score, IQR, Interquartile range, SD, Standard deviation\n†χ2 test; ‡Continuous corrected χ2 test; *Mann-Whitney test; §Student’s t test\nCharacteristics of the hematomas\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of the hematomas</u>\nFor continuous variables, data are median (IQR; range) and mean (SD); for categorical variables, data are number (%).

Three (11%) of 27 patients died within 30 days in the surgery group, one of which had rebleeding after the first evacuation and his relatives refused permission for a second operation, one developed severe renal failure and the other one died for an unknown reason.\nThe prognosis-based modified Rankin score showed favorable outcomes in 10 (37%) of 27 patients in the surgery group, which was significantly lower than the favorable outcomes in the conservative treatment group (P= 0.006).\nThe prespecified subgroup analyses are shown in Fig. 2, none of which showed heterogeneity of treatment response. At 12 months, 2 (8%) of 26 patients died in the poor prognosis group and 9 (35%) had severe lower disability; 2 (7%) of the 28 patients in the good prognosis group died; and 2 (7%) were severely lower disabled. Patients in the good prognosis group were more likely to recover well or to have only moderate disability (3 [11%] of 28 and 16 [57%], respectively) than were those in the poor prognosis group (0 of 26 and 7 [27%], respectively).\nIn this study, using prognosis-based outcomes, we found that patients with small spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages in the basal ganglia (hematoma volume between 25 and 40 ml) experienced a good clinical outcome with conservative treatment. Among these patients, patients treated with conservative treatment appeared to have a beneficial effect on functional recovery at the 12-month follow-up compared with PSM patients treated with conventional craniotomy. Nevertheless, the two groups had no dramatic difference in their 12-month mortality rate.\nMendelow et al. found no significant difference between an early surgery group and an initial conservative treat group for patients with spontaneous ICH in the basal ganglia (16.9% and 17.7%, respectively) in STICH I 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. This might be influenced by patients who had undergone delayed surgery in the initial conservative treatment group. Patients who crossed over to surgery were in a significantly worse condition than were those allocated to early surgery. Thus, the present study excluded patients who must be operated on because of a brain hernia or underwent delayed surgery because of deterioration of their condition to purely compare the efficacy of conventional craniotomy and conservative treatment to the fullest extent possible. PSM with age, GCS, volume, and midline shift was performed to bridge the gap of patients’ baseline characteristics between the two groups. Thus, the comparisons were meaningful despite the small numbers of patients.\nThe resulting assignment used a sliding dichotomy, referring to the design of the first STICH trial 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Because patients in this study tended to be older (median 55 years) and all had limb nerve deficits, independence achieved at home is worthwhile compared to relying on 24-h care for an older stroke victim. The Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale classifies the severe disability categories as dependent or independent at home. To achieve the outcome of moderate disability, the person must be able to take public transport and go shopping independently 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. While this result might be expected in a patient with mild symptoms, a patient who was initially in a coma (GCS < 9) or severely hemiplegic would not be expected to achieve this degree of independence. Therefore, we decided to differentiate patients’ treatment goals based on their initial prognosis (according to a verified formula). This dichotomy based on prognosis greatly enhanced the power of the study to identify modest treatment effect.\nTo decrease any potential bias, we used interviewers blinded to the group assignment of the patients for the follow-up at 12 months. Patients were interviewed strictly based on the questionnaires for outcome assessment in order to be not biased by the interviewers' perceptions.\nThe overall results of the study indicate that conventional craniotomy is not a good choice for minor hematomas in the basal ganglia. This result is surprising but makes sense. There are good clinical reasons for the hypothesis that craniotomy might be harmful for deepseated intracerebral hemorrhage. The idea behind surgical evacuation of intracerebral hematomas is to reduce the mass effect, thereby reducing intracranial pressure, improving regional blood flow, and limiting the toxicity of blood-breakdown products 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. Additionally, craniotomy provides a clear operative field and hematoma borders under a microscope.\nHowever, craniotomy also requires a large scalp incision, which might cause secondary trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. Extensive siphoning and pulling in the basal ganglia region may injure any surrounding brain tissue that is still functional and may induce extensive damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. It could be observed in our study that long-term functional recovery in the surgery group was worse than in the conservative treatment group, which indicates that the trauma of open craniotomy for small basal ganglia hemorrhages outweigh the benefits it brings. In addition, the spastic vessels are hard to visualize intraoperatively, which possibly increases the risk of postoperative rebleeding. Three patients in the surgery group suffered rebleeding in this study, while none of the patients in the conservative treatment group experienced this.\nIn addition, the surgery was performed under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. Respiratory injuries and prolonged bed rest might explain the high rate of hospitalized pneumonia in the surgery group. Finally, hematoma evacuation through craniotomy has a relatively longer operative duration 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>, which might increase the risk of mortality in patients, especially among older people 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. The guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association in 2015 had mentioned that the effectiveness of surgery is not well established for most patients with supratentorial ICH 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Thus, less invasive surgery such as clot evacuation with stereotactic 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> or endoscopic aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> have moved naturally onto the research agenda for small hematomas in basal ganglia. The stereotactic needle aspiration of basal ganglia hemorrhages (25-40 mm3) was compared to medical management alone in the randomized study of 465 patients. The result revealed that neurological outcome was better in the aspiration group in the 3-month follow-up, while there was no significant difference on mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Recombinant Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator for ICH Evacuation Trial II (MISTIE II) was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery plus rtPA in the treatment of ICH. Seventy-nine surgical patients with 39 conservative patients were enrolled in this study which demonstrated a significant reduction of perihematomal edema in the evacuation group along with a trend toward better outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Therefore, the efficacy of minimally invasive clot evacuation is still uncertain.\nIt needs to be acknowledged that this study has some limitations. First, this study was a single-center retrospective case-control study with propensity score matching. Potential selective bias remained although it was greatly decreased. The small sample size of the present study could not provide robust evidence for clinical practice. The second limitation was that all operations were not performed by the same neurosurgeon, which might influence the consistency of surgical outcomes. Some high-quality, rigorous, randomized controlled trials are needed for further investigation of this topic.\nThe present study’s results suggest that for patients with minor hematomas (25-40 ml) in the basal ganglion, it should be cautious to undertake conventional craniotomy. The open craniotomy might induce worse long-term functional outcomes than conservative treatment. The results of this study might provide a warning for surgical decision making for patients with minor basal ganglion hemorrhages, but further detailed research is still needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is a gel-forming mucin predominantly expressed in airway epithelial cells; its expression is up-regulated in chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5]</u> Several natural products are reported to affect airway mucin production.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u> We, therefore, sought to identify natural medicinal compounds to inhibit MUC5AC overexpression. Curcumin (CUR), a polyphenolic compound of turmeric (Curcuma longa) and a pharmacologically safe agent, has been shown to exert various biological effects through its antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u> CUR is also known to inhibit paraquat-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis in mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> A recent study demonstrated that CUR may inhibit MUC5AC production induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or interleukin (IL)-1beta in human airway epithelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u> However, whether CUR plays the same role in mucus overproduction in vivo and the underlying mechanism remain to be elucidated.\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is an important and opportunistic human respiratory pathogen associated with serious chronic inflammatory airway disease, especially hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of P. aeruginosa, is one of the most potent inducers of mucus overproduction.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u> We sought to identify the role of CUR in LPS-induced MUC5AC mucin production, as well as the underlying mechanism.\nRecent studies have shown that excessive oxidative stress plays an important role in MUC5AC mucin expression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the MUC5AC production induced by LPS, cigarette smoke, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and neutrophil elastase.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16]</u> Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a member of the cap 'n’ collar basic leucine zipper transcription factor family, is a critical regulator of defense against oxidative damage. Nrf2 is thought to protect lung and other tissues against oxidative insults such as those caused by bacterial endotoxin, inflammatory factors, cigarette smoking, and hyperoxia.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18,19]</u>\nQi et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> reported that Nrf2 is involved in neutrophil elastase-induced MUC5AC expression in human airway epithelial cells. Our laboratory has previously shown that Nrf2 ameliorates cigarette smoking-induced mucus overproduction in airway epithelium and mouse lung.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> CUR is recognized to induce Nrf2 activation and to protect cells and tissues against oxidative insult, airway inflammation, and lung carcinogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22,23]</u>\nDespite extensive study of CUR’s role in the treatment of lung disorders, little is known about the effect of CUR on LPS-induced MUC5AC mucin expression or about the role of Nrf2 in this process. In the present study, we attempted to explore whether CUR regulates the production of MUC5AC induced by LPS in airway epithelial cells and mouse lung. To confirm the specific role of Nrf2 in mucin regulation of CUR, we investigated whether knockdown of Nrf2 with Nrf2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) could influence MUC5AC expression in NCI-H292 cells. We demonstrated that CUR protected against LPS-induced MUC5AC mucin production and that the process was mediated, in part, by Nrf2. Based on its antioxidant effects, we identified CUR as a potential agent for prevention of mucus hypersecretion in chronic inflammatory airway disease.\nRPMI-1640 and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). LPS, CUR (purity: 98%) and methylthiazolyltetrazolium (MTT) were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). TRIzol reagent was Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total RNA isolation and reverse transcription systems were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). Antibodies against human MUC5AC (45M1) was from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Rockford, IL, USA. Lot. PJ1926761). Antibodies against mouse MUC5AC, Nrf2, and β-actin were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA. Lot. GR257950-1, GR37038-9, and GR212262-9). Antibodies against human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were from Abway (China. Lot. F011207).\nA human pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line, NCI-H292, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2/95% air, water-jacketed incubator. Before experimentation, confluent NCI-H292 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and recultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 overnight to maintain low basal levels of MUC5AC expression. After serum deprivation, the cells were pretreated with varying concentrations of CUR for 30 min and treated with LPS (10 µg/ml) for 24 h in serum-free RPMI 1640. The LPS and CUR were dissolved in RPMI 1640 and dimethylsulfoxide, respectively. The final concentrations of dimethylsulfoxide were 0.5%, which did not affect mucin gene expression and production. The cytotoxicity was determined by the conventional 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, following exactly as the supplier’s protocol.\nThe human Nrf2 siRNA or the scrambled RNA as a negative control (Invitrogen, USA) were transfected into NCI-H292 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml, until they reached 50–70% confluency. Next, 100 nmol/L siRNA in 1 ml growth medium was incubated with NCI-H292 cells for 24 h. Then, infection medium was removed and replaced with fresh growth medium.\nA ROS detection Kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) was used to measure the total ROS generated by LPS following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded in each well of 6-well plates and grown to 70–80% confluency. After overnight serum starvation, the cells were co-treated with CUR and LPS for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with a ROS wash buffer containing ROS detection solution. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a flow cytometry.\nThe 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Fujian Medical University 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2015000515917 and No. 2015000518707)</u>. All animal protocols and procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Mice were pretreated with intraperitoneal injection of CUR (50 mg/kg) or vehicle. After 2 h of CUR administration, mice were treated with 100 µg LPS (in 50 µl saline) by intratracheal instillation and sacrificed after 6 days. Control mice received the same volume of saline.\nMouse tracheas were cannulated, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained by injecting 0.4 ml PBS into the right lungs (twice). After the total number of BALF cells was counted, remaining BALF was centrifuged at 400 ×g for 10 min at 4°C. Cell pellets were spun onto glass microscope slides and stained with Wright-Giemsa (Baso). Total cells and neutrophils counts were assessed through light microscopy.\nAfter BALF collection, the left lungs were fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h and then embedded in paraffin. The lung tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or periodic acid-Schiff’s (PAS) following standard protocols. The extent of inflammation was assessed according to published guidelines. To measure airway mucus production, PAS-stained goblet cells in airway epithelium were scored, as described previously.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>\nTotal RNA from cells and lung homogenate was isolated with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with the Reverse Transcription Reagent Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The mRNA expression of MUC5AC and Nrf2 was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using SYBR Green Master Mix (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Japan) on a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). PCR primers used in the study are listed in Table 1.\nPrimers for quantitative real-time PCR analysis\n删除重复语句：<u>Primers for quantitative real-time PCR analysis</u>\nPCR: Polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MUC5AC: Mucin 5AC; Nrf2: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2.\nAfter LPS stimulation for 24 h, H292 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (Beyotime) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, IN, USA), then subjected to 8–10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and incubated with various primary antibodies in antibody diluent overnight at 4°C. The membrane was washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Thermo Scientific, USA).\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). All calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 statistical software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Student’s t-test was used when two groups were compared. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nTo confirm whether LPS can induce MUC5AC production in NCI-H292 cells, we evaluated the MUC5AC mRNA expression after addition of LPS to the cells at various concentrations for different times. Consistent with previous reports, we found that stimulation with LPS led to a time-dependent and dose-independent increase in MUC5AC expression. This effect was most apparent after treatment with 10 μg/ml LPS for 24 h 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a and Figure 1b]</u>. Compared with the control group, the expression of MUC5AC mRNA and protein in LPS group is 7.169 ± 1.785 (t = −5.981, P < 0.01) and 2.340 ± 0.209 (t = −11.101, P < 0.01), respectively 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nIn order to assess the effect of CUR on LPS-induced MUC5AC expression in human NCI-H292 cells, mRNA, and protein expression of MUC5AC was measured by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Cells were pretreated with CUR for 30 min before the addition of 10 μg/ml LPS. There was no significant damage to NCI-H292 cells when the concentration of CUR was <40 μmol/L (data not shown). Compared with LPS group, the expression of MUC5AC mRNA (2.424 ± 0.318 vs. 7.169 ± 1.785, t= 4.534, P < 0.05) and protein (1.060 ± 0.197 vs. 2.340 ± 0.209, t = 7.716, P < 0.05) significantly decreased after treatment with CUR in a dose-dependent manner, respectively 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1c and Figure 1d]</u>.\nROS levels, as determined by flow cytometry, were significantly higher in the LPS group than those in the control group. However, pretreatment with CUR resulted in significant decrease in ROS production after exposure to LPS 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nIn order to investigate the possible role of Nrf2 in CUR-mediated inhibition of mucus production, we further analyzed mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2 in NCI-H292 cells that had been preincubated with 40 μmol/L CUR for 30 min before exposure to 10 μg/ml LPS for 24 h. CUR significantly increased Nrf2 mRNA and protein expression in NCI-H292 cells, compared with the LPS group (1.952 ± 0.340 vs. 1.142 ± 0.176, t = −3.661, and 2.010 ± 0.209 vs. 1.089 ± 0.132, t = −6.453, both P < 0.05, respectively) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3a and Figure 3b]</u>.\nTo confirm the involvement of Nrf2 in CUR’s inhibition of LPS-induced MUC5AC mucin production, we used Nrf2 siRNA to knockdown Nrf2. MUC5AC expression in NCI-H292 cells were examined by real-time PCR and Western blotting. As shown in Figure 3c and Figure 3d, Nrf2 siRNA (100 nmol/L) significantly decreased expression of Nrf2 mRNA and protein in NCI-H292 cells. Compared with the negative-siRNA + LPS group, knockdown of Nrf2 with Nrf2 siRNA increased MUC5AC mRNA expression by 47.7% (6.845 ± 1.478 vs. 3.391 ± 0.517, t = −3.821, P < 0.05). Using mouse monoclonal antibody to MUC5AC (clone 45 M1, 1:100), we confirmed that Nrf2 siRNA markedly increased MUC5AC protein expression in NCI-H292 cells. These results suggest that Nrf2 is partly involved in the inhibitory activity of CUR against LPS-induced MUC5AC expression in airway epithelial cells.\nAfter establishing that CUR inhibits LPS-induced MUC5AC expression through Nrf2 in vitro, we sought to evaluate the same phenomenon in vivo. We found that CUR (50 mg/kg) significantly decreased LPS-induced mRNA and protein expression of MUC5AC in mouse lung (1.672 ± 0.721 vs. 5.961 ± 2.452, t= 2.906, and 0.480 ± 0.191 vs. 2.290 ± 0.834, t = 3.665, respectively; both P < 0.05) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4a and Figure 4c]</u>, and also suppressed mucin production as demonstrated by Alcian blue/PAS stain 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4d]</u>. As shown in Figure 4b and Figure 4c, CUR significantly increased Nrf2 mRNA and protein expression, compared with levels observed in the LPS group (2.076 ± 0.097 vs. 0.953 ± 0.263, t= −6.924, and 2.303 ± 0.295 vs. 1.089 ± 0.132, t = −6.499; both P < 0.01, respectively).\nAs a major component of gram-negative bacteria, LPS increases airway mucin secretion and induces airway inflammation. To evaluate the effects of CUR on LPS-induced inflammation in mouse lung, we counted the numbers of inflammatory cells and neutrophils in BALF and lung tissue of mice pretreated with CUR for 2 h before exposure to LPS for 7 days. Compared with LPS group, the numbers of total inflammatory cells (247 ± 30 vs. 334 ± 24, t= 3.901, P < 0.05) and neutrophils (185 ± 22 vs. 246 ± 20, t = 3.566, P < 0.05) in BALF decreased in the LPS + CUR group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5a and Figure 5b]</u>. Inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue was also reduced in CUR-treated mice, compared with LPS-challenged mice 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5c]</u>. These data suggest that CUR might be involved in the regulation of LPS-induced airway inflammation in vivo.\nThe study demonstrates that CUR inhibits LPS-induced MUC5AC mucin production and that this effect is mediated by Nrf2. The results presented above show that CUR suppressed LPS-induced MUC5AC mRNA and protein production, accompanied increased expression of Nrf2 in alveolar epithelial NCI-H292 cells and mouse lung. Nrf2 siRNA significantly blocked the protective activity of CUR against MUC5AC mucin expression induced by LPS in NCI-H292 cells.\nExcessive mucus secretion is an important pathophysiological characteristic of chronic inflammatory airway diseases, and the regulation of mucus overproduction is a major therapeutic target. CUR has been reported to show anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress and anticancer effects in respiratory epithelial cell. Heo et al. and Chang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u> reported that CUR could inhibit the expression of MUC5AC induced by EGF or IL-1beta in NCI-H292 cells, respectively. LPS is a well-known pathogen for respiratory diseases, and also plays a significant role in the induction of MUC5AC expression. However, no previous study has reported that CUR regulates LPS-induced MUC5AC overproduction. We examined the effect of CUR on LPS-induced MUC5AC gene expression and mucin production in NCI-H292 cells and C57BL mice. The results presented above show that CUR suppressed the MUC5AC expression induced by LPS in vitro and in vivo; this effect was dose independent. CUR also inhibited the production of MUC5AC mucin protein induced by LPS. These results suggest that CUR regulates the mRNA and protein expression of mucin induced by LPS.\nThe mechanism by which CUR inhibits mucus production remains unclear. Numerous studies have reported the indispensable role of oxidative stress in LPS-induced mucin regulation. Our laboratory has reported that ROS and Duox1, one of the NADPH oxidases, are involved in LPS-induced MUC5AC expression in A549 cells and primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> As an important transcription factor responsible for anti-oxidative stress and cytoprotection, the role of Nrf2 in mucins regulation has been investigated. Qi et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> demonstrated that Nrf2 could regulate neutrophil elastase-induced MUC5AC expression in human airway epithelial cells. We found that Nrf2 ameliorated cigarette smoking-induced mucus overproduction in airway epithelium and mouse lungs.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Soetikno et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> demonstrated that CUR alleviated oxidative stress, inflammation, and renal fibrosis in remnant kidney through the Nrf2-keap1 pathway. Kim et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> showed that CUR-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated macrophages through Nrf2 signaling. Liu et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> showed that CUR ameliorates asthmatic airway inflammation by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. However, there is none answer whether or not Nrf2 directly regulated the protective activity of CUR against MUC5AC mucin production induced by LPS. In the present study, we confirmed CUR attenuate LPS-induced ROS production and induce Nrf2 expression in NCI-H292 cells and mouse lungs. When Nrf2 expression was knockdowned by siRNA, the inhibitory effect of CUR against LPS-induced MUC5AC mucin expression was suppressed. These findings suggest that CUR might regulate LPS-induced mucus production through Nrf2 signaling.\nThe study had certain limitations. We should have included a rescue experiment by adding back Nrf2 after siRNA knockdown. Experiments on Nrf2-/- mice would have been useful to confirm the role of Nrf2 in mediating CUR’s inhibition of LPS-induced mucin overproduction.\nIn conclusion, the results presented above demonstrate that CUR inhibits LPS-induced mucus production partly through activation of Nrf2. The findings presented in this study might provide novel insight into the development of new drugs against mucus hypersecretion. CUR represents a promising candidate for a therapeutic intervention in inhibit mucus hypersecretion in chronic inflammatory airway disease.\nThis study was supported in part by grants from the Youth Research Project of Fujian Provincial Bureau 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 40935)</u>, the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2013J01289)</u>, and National Key R and D Program of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2016YFC1304000)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Actually, real-world studies differ significantly from RCTs in terms of study conditions and mass vaccination in real world requires taking into account factors, which are far more complex, such as widely heterogeneous populations, vaccine supply, willingness, medical accessibility, etc. Therefore, the real safety and effectiveness of vaccines turn out to be a major concern of international community.

In the present study, we aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the COVID-19 vaccine in the real world and to establish a reliable evidence-based basis for the actual protective effect of the COVID-19 vaccines, especially in the ensuing waves of infections dominated by variants.\nOur methods were described in detail in our published protocol [PROSPERO (Prospective register of systematic reviews) registration, CRD42021267110]. We searched eligible studies published by 22 July 2021, from three databases including PubMed, Embase and Web of Science by the following search terms: (effectiveness OR safety) AND (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (vaccine OR vaccination). We used End-NoteX9.0 (Thomson ResearchSoft, Stanford, USA) to manage records, screen and exclude duplicates. This study was strictly performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).\nWe included observational studies that examined the effectiveness and safety of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines among people vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Cohort studies and case-control studies were classified as having low (≥ 7 stars), moderate (5-6 stars), and high risk of bias (≤ 4 stars) with an overall quality score of 9 stars. For cross-sectional studies, we assigned each item of the AHRQ checklist a score of 1 (answered \"yes\" ) or 0 (answered \"no\" or \"unclear\" ), and summarized scores across items to generate an overall quality score that ranged from 0 to 11. Low, moderate, and high risk of bias were identified as having a score of 8-11, 4-7 and 0-3, respectively.\nTwo investigators (LQ and QCY) independently assessed study quality, with disagreements resolved by a third investigator (LJ).\nWe performed a meta-analysis to pool data from included studies and assess the effectiveness and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines by clinical outcomes (rates of the prevention of COVID-19, the prevention of hospitalization, the prevention of admission to the ICU, the prevention of COVID-19-related death, and adverse events after vaccination). Random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the rates and adjusted estimates across studies separately, based on the heterogeneity between estimates (I2). Fixed-effects models were used if I2 ≤ 50%, which represented low to moderate heterogeneity and random-effects models were used if I2 > 50%, representing substantial heterogeneity.\nWe conducted subgroup analyses to investigate the possible sources of heterogeneity by using vaccine kinds, vaccination status, sample size, and study population as grouping variables. We used the Q test to conduct subgroup comparisons and variables were considered significant between subgroups if the subgroup difference P value was less than 0.05. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot and Egger’s regression test. We analyzed data using Stata version 16.0 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).\nA total of 4844 records were searched from the three databases. 2484 duplicates were excluded.

VE was 94% (95% CI: 78-98%) in ≥ 21 days after the second dose for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, higher than other subgroups, regardless of 2 dose group . For the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19, VE was also relatively higher in 21 days after the second dose (99%, 95% CI: 94-100%). Subgroups showed no statistically significant differences in the prevention of hospital admissions, ICU admissions and COVID-19-related death (subgroup difference P values were 0.991, 0.414, and 0.851, respectively).\nIn the fully vaccinated groups (over 14 days after the second dose), the pooled VE was 85% (95% CI: 80-91%) for the prevention of Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 54% (95% CI: 35-74%) for the Gamma variant, and 74% (95% CI: 62-85%) for the Delta variant. There was only one study 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> focused on the Beta variant, which showed the VE was 75% (95% CI: 71-79%) for the prevention of the Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2 infection. BNT162b2 vaccine had the highest VE in each variant group; 92% (95% CI: 90-94%) for the Alpha variant, 62% (95% CI: 2-88%) for the Gamma variant, and 84% (95% CI: 75-92%) for the Delta variant .\nFor studies which had not mentioned the variant of SARS-CoV-2, the pooled VE was 86% (95% CI: 76-97%) for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated people. mRNA-1273 vaccine had the highest pooled VE 通用删除1(英):<u>(97%, 95% CI: 93-100%, Fig. 2)</u>.\nAs Table 2 showed, the incidence rate of adverse events varied widely among different studies. We conducted subgroup analysis by study population (general population, patients and healthcare workers), vaccine type (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, CoronaVac, and et al.), and population size 删除2：<u>(< 1000, 1000-10 000, 10 000-100 000, and > 100 000)</u>. The overall pooled incidence rate was 1.5% (95% CI: 1.4-1.6%) for adverse events, 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2-0.5) per 10 000 for severe adverse events, and 0.1 (95% CI: 0.1-0.2) per 10 000 for death after vaccination. Incidence rate of adverse events was higher in healthcare workers (53.2%, 95% CI: 28.4-77.9%), AZD1222 vaccine group (79.6%, 95% CI: 60.8-98.3%), and < 1000 population size group (57.6%, 95% CI: 47.9-67.4%). Incidence rate of sever adverse events was higher in healthcare workers (127.2, 95% CI: 62.7-191.8, per 10 000), Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine group (175.7, 95% CI: 77.2-274.2, per 10 000), and 1000-10 000 population size group (336.6, 95% CI: 41.4-631.8, per 10 000). Incidence rate of death after vaccination was higher in patients (7.6, 95% CI: 0.0-32.2, per 10 000), BNT162b2 vaccine group (29.8, 95% CI: 0.0-71.2, per 10 000), and < 1000 population size group (29.8, 95% CI: 0.0-71.2, per 10 000). Subgroups of general population, vaccine type not mentioned, and > 100 000 population size had the lowest incidence rate of adverse events, severe adverse events, and death after vaccination.\nSubgroup analysis of incidence rate of adverse events, sever adverse events and death after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, by study population, vaccine type, and population size\n删除重复语句：<u>Subgroup analysis of incidence rate of adverse events, sever adverse events and death after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, by study population, vaccine type, and population size</u>\nCI confidence interval\nIn the sensitivity analyses, VE for SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic COVID-19 and COVID-19-related death got relatively lower when omitting over a single dose group of Maria et al.’s work 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>; when omitting ≥ 14 days after the first dose group and ≥ 14 days after the second dose group of Alejandro et al.’s work 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>, VE for SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalization, ICU admission and COVID-19-related death got relatively higher; and VE for all clinical status of COVID-19 became lower when omitting ≥ 14 days after the second dose group of Eric et al.’s work 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. Incidence rate of adverse events and severe adverse events got relatively higher when omitting China CDC’s data 通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u>. P values of Egger’s regression test for all the meta-analysis were more than 0.05, indicating that there might not be publication bias.\nTo our knowledge, this is a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effectiveness and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on real-world studies, reporting pooled VE for different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and incidence rate of adverse events. This meta-analysis comprised a total of 58 studies, including 32 studies for vaccine effectiveness and 26 studies for vaccine safety. We found that a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was about 40-60% effective at preventing any clinical status of COVID-19 and that two doses were 85% or more effective. Although vaccines were not as effective against variants of SARS-CoV-2 as original virus, the vaccine effectiveness was still over 50% for fully vaccinated people. Normal adverse events were common, while the incidence of severe adverse events or even death was very low, providing reassurance to health care providers and to vaccine recipients and promote confidence in the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Our findings strengthen and augment evidence from previous review 通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u>, which confirmed the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, and additionally reported the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, giving insight on the future of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine schedules.\nAlthough most vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 are two-dose vaccines, we found that the pooled VE of a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was about 50%. Recent study showed that the T cell and antibody responses induced by a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine were comparable to those naturally infected with SARE-CoV-2 within weeks or months after infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[76]</u>. Our findings could help to develop vaccination strategies under certain circumstances such as countries having a shortage of vaccines. In some countries, in order to administer the first dose to a larger population, the second dose was delayed for up to 12 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[77]</u>. Some countries such as Canada had even decided to delay the second dose for 16 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u>. However, due to a suboptimum immune response in those receiving only a single dose of a vaccine, such an approach had a chance to give rise to the emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>[79]</u>. There remains a need for large clinical trials to assess the efficacy of a single-dose administration of two-dose vaccines and the risk of increasing the emergence of variants.\nTwo doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were highly effective at preventing hospitalization, severe cases and deaths resulting from COVID-19, while the VE of different groups of days from the second vaccine dose showed no statistically significant differences. Our findings emphasized the importance of getting fully vaccinated, for the fact that most breakthrough infections were mild or asymptomatic. A recent study showed that the occurrence of breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 in fully vaccinated populations was predictable with neutralizing antibody titers during the peri-infection period 通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u>. We also found getting fully vaccinated was at least 50% effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 variants infections, despite reduced effectiveness compared with original virus; and BNT162b2 vaccine was found to have the highest VE in each variant group. Studies showed that the highly mutated variants were indicative of a form of rapid, multistage evolutionary jumps, which could preferentially occur in the milieu of partial immune control 通用删除6(英):<u>[81,82]</u>. Therefore, immunocompromised patients should be prioritized for anti-COVID-19 immunization to mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections, during which multimutational SARS-CoV-2 variants could arise 通用删除6(英):<u>[83]</u>.\nRecently, many countries, including Israel, the United States, China and the United Kingdom, have introduced a booster of COVID-19 vaccine, namely the third dose 通用删除6(英):<u>[84,85,86,87]</u>. A study of Israel showed that among people vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine over 60 years, the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe illness in the non-booster group was 11.3 times (95% CI: 10.4-12.3) and 19.5 times (95% CI: 12.9-29.5) than the booster group, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[84]</u>. Some studies have found that the third dose of Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Sinovac produced a spike in infection-blocking neutralizing antibodies when given a few months after the second dose 通用删除6(英):<u>[85,87,88]</u>. In addition, the common adverse events associated with the third dose did not differ significantly from the symptoms of the first two doses, ranging from mild to moderate 通用删除6(英):<u>[85]</u>. The overall incidence rate of local and systemic adverse events was 69% (57/97) and 20% (19/97) after receiving the third dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[88]</u>. Results of a phase 3 clinical trial involving 306 people aged 18-55 years showed that adverse events after receiving a third dose of BNT162b2 vaccine (5-8 months after completion of two doses) were similar to those reported after receiving a second dose 通用删除6(英):<u>[85]</u>. Based on V-safe, local reactions were more frequently after dose 3 (5323/6283; 84.7%) than dose 2 (5249/6283; 83.5%) among people who received 3 doses of Moderna. Systemic reactions were reported less frequently after dose 3 (4963/6283; 79.0%) than dose 2 (5105/6283; 81.3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u>. On August 4, WHO called for a halt to booster shots until at least the end of September to achieve an even distribution of the vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>[89]</u>. At this stage, the most important thing we should be thinking about is how to reach a global cover of people at risk with the first or second dose, rather than focusing on the third dose.\nBased on real world studies, our results preliminarily showed that complete inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines was still effective against infection of variants, although the VE was generally diminished compared with the original virus. Particularly, the pooled VE was 54% (95% CI: 35-74%) for the Gamma variant, and 74% (95% CI: 62-85%) for the Delta variant. Since the wide spread of COVID-19, a number of variants have drawn extensive attention of international community, including Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), first identified in the United Kingdom; Beta variant (B.1.351) in South Africa; Gamma variant 通用删除11(英):<u>(P.1)</u>, initially appeared in Brazil; and the most infectious one to date, Delta variant (B.1.617.2) 通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u>. Israel recently reported a breakthrough infection of SARS-CoV-2, dominated by variant B.1.1.7 in a small number of fully vaccinated health care workers, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the original vaccine against those variants 通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u>. According to an observational cohort study in Qatar, VE of the BNT162b2 vaccine against the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variants was 87% (95% CI: 81.8-90.7%) and 75.0% (95% CI: 70.5-7.9%), respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Based on the National Immunization Management System of England, results from a recent real-world study of all the general population showed that the AZD1222 and BNT162b2 vaccines protected against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of Alpha variant with 74.5% (95% CI: 68.4-79.4%) and 93.7% (95% CI: 91.6-95.3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In contrast, the VE against the Delta variant was 67.0% (95% CI: 61.3-71.8%) for two doses of AZD1222 vaccine and 88% (95% CI: 85.3-90.1%) for BNT162b2 vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\nIn terms of adverse events after vaccination, the pooled incidence rate was very low, only 1.5% (95% CI: 1.4-1.6%). However, the prevalence of adverse events reported in large population (population size > 100 000) was much lower than that in small to medium population size. On the one hand, the vaccination population in the small to medium scale studies we included were mostly composed by health care workers, patients with specific diseases or the elderly. And these people are more concerned about their health and more sensitive to changes of themselves. But it remains to be proved whether patients or the elderly are more likely to have adverse events than the general. Mainstream vaccines currently on the market have maintained robust safety in specific populations such as cancer patients, organ transplant recipients, patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases, pregnant women and the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>[54,91,92,93,94]</u>. A prospective study by Tal Goshen-lag suggests that the safety of BNT162b2 vaccine in cancer patients is consistent with those previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>[91]</u>. In addition, the incidence rate of adverse events reported in the heart-lung transplant population is even lower than that in general population 通用删除6(英):<u>[95]</u>. On the other hand, large scale studies at the national level are mostly based on national electronic health records or adverse event reporting systems, and it is likely that most mild or moderate symptoms are actually not reported.\nCompared with the usual local adverse events (such as pain at the injection site, redness at the injection site, etc.) and normal systemic reactions (such as fatigue, myalgia, etc.), serious and life-threatening adverse events were rare due to our results. A meta-analysis based on RCTs only showed three cases of anaphylactic shock among 58 889 COVID-19 vaccine recipients and one in the placebo group 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The exact mechanisms underlying most of the adverse events are still unclear, accordingly we cannot establish a causal relation between severe adverse events and vaccination directly based on observational studies. In general, varying degrees of adverse events occur after different types of COVID-19 vaccination. Nevertheless, the benefits far outweigh the risks.\nOur results showed the effectiveness and safety of different types of vaccines varied greatly. Regardless of SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccine effectiveness varied from 66% (CoronaVac 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>) to 97% (mRNA-1273 通用删除6(英):<u>[18,20,45,46]</u>). The incidence rate of adverse events varied widely among different types of vaccines, which, however, could be explained by the sample size and population group of participants. BNT162b2, AZD1222, mRNA-1273 and CoronaVac were all found to have high vaccine efficacy and acceptable adverse-event profile in recent published studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[96,97,98,99]</u>. A meta-analysis, focusing on the potential vaccine candidate which have reached to the phase 3 of clinical development, also found that although many of the vaccines caused more adverse events than the controls, most were mild, transient and manageable 通用删除6(英):<u>[100]</u>. However, severe adverse events did occur, and there remains the need to implement a unified global surveillance system to monitor the adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines around the world 通用删除6(英):<u>[101]</u>. A recent study employed a knowledge-based or rational strategy to perform a prioritization matrix of approved COVID-19 vaccines, and led to a scale with JANSSEN (Ad26.COV2.S) in the first place, and AZD1222, BNT162b2, and Sputnik V in second place, followed by BBIBP-CorV, CoronaVac and mRNA-1273 in third place 通用删除6(英):<u>[101]</u>. Moreover, when deciding the priority of vaccines, the socioeconomic characteristics of each country should also be considered.\nOur meta-analysis still has several limitations. First, we may include limited basic data on specific populations, as vaccination is slowly being promoted in populations under the age of 18 or over 60. Second, due to the limitation of the original real-world study, we did not conduct subgroup analysis based on more population characteristics, such as age. When analyzing the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccine, we may have neglected the discussion on the heterogeneity from these sources. Third, most of the original studies only collected adverse events within 7 days after vaccination, which may limit the duration of follow-up for safety analysis.\nBased on the real-world studies, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have reassuring safety and could effectively reduce the death, severe cases, symptomatic cases, and infections resulting from SARS-CoV-2 across the world. In the context of global pandemic and the continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, accelerating vaccination and improving vaccination coverage is still the most important and urgent matter, and it is also the final means to end the pandemic.\nCharacteristic of studies included for vaccine effectiveness.\nCharacteristic of studies included for vaccine safety.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Therefore, the utilization of stem cells is becoming the most promising therapy for diabetes mellitus (DM). Here,we studied the differentiation capacity of the diabetic patient's bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and tested the feasibility of using MSCs for β-cell replacement.Methods Bone marrow-derived MSCs were obtained from 10 DM patients (5 type 1 DM and 5 type 2 DM) and induced to IPCs under a three-stage protocol. Representative cell surface antigen expression profiles of MSCs were analysed by flow cytometric analysis. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect multiple genes related to pancreatic β-cell development and function. The identity of the IPCs was illustrated by the analysis of morphology, ditizone staining and immunocytochemistry. Release of insulin by these cells was confirmed by immunoradioassay.Results Flow cytometric analysis of MSCs at passage 3 showed that these cells expressed high levels of CD29 (98.28%), CD44 (99.56%) and CD106 (98.34%). Typical islet-like cell clusters were observed at the end of the protocol (18 days). Ditizone staining and immunohistochemistry for insulin were both positive. These differentiated cells at stage 2 (10 days) expressed nestin, pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1), Neurogenin3, Pax4, insulin, glucagon, but at stage 3 (18 days) we observed the high expression of PDX-1, insulin, glucagon. Insulin was secreted by these cells in response to different concentrations of glucose stimulation in a regulated manner (P＜0.05).Conclusions Bone marrow-derived MSCs from DM patients can differentiate into functional IPCs under certain conditions in vitro.

These alterations include the hierarchy of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements and somatic hypermutation of Ig variable region (V) genes, and may cause inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and overexpression of oncogenes that, in turn, result in B-cell transformation. In addition to genetic alterations, microenvironmental factors that deliver positive signals for B-cell survival and growth may contribute to the development and progression of B-cell lymphomas.1 A number of signaling pathways are involved in the initiation and development of B-cell lymphomagenesis. In particular, the functions of several key proteins that represent branching points in the signaling networks are altered as a result of aberrant expression, degradation, and/or accumulation, and these events determine the fate of the affected B-cells. Of these proteins, the most influential transcription factors involved in B-cell lymphomas are Myc and p53, with alterations in these molecules commonly associated with poor prognosis.\nMyc aberrations are common in aggressive B-cell lymphoma subtypes. During B-cell lymphomagenesis, oncogenic Myc variants are deregulated via various mechanisms, such as gene translocation, gene amplification, and epigenetic deregulation of expression.2 In most cases, aberrations include translocations or amplifications of the MYC coding region, leading to Myc overexpression and a change in protein function due to aberrations in the amino acid sequence or protein conformation.3 On the other hand, Myc, as a transcription factor, functions as both an activator and a repressor of multiple downstream pathways, promoting proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells. Myc overexpression adds to the existing oncogenic gene expression profile by enhancing activity of the already active genes in the tumor cells.4 Myc contributes to oncogenic changes and cell transformation; however, its aberration alone is not sufficient to initiate lymphomagenesis. This is consistent with very low or negative Myc protein expression in normal lymphoid cells.\np53 is one of the most important molecules involved in the pathogenesis of cancers, including B-cell lymphomas. Tumor suppression by TP53 occurs via both transcription-dependent and transcription-independent activities. Transcription-dependent activities occur in the nucleus by which p53 regulates transcription of genes involved in the cell cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis, signaling, transcription, and metabolism.5 Transcription-independent activities induce apoptosis and autophagy in the cytoplasm. Mutations in TP53 and dysregulation of the pathway are important in the pathogenesis of many human cancers, including lymphomas. In lymphoid malignancies, the frequency of TP53 deletions and mutations is lower than that in other types of cancers. Nonetheless, the status of TP53 is an independent prognostic factor in most lymphoma types.删除4：<u>6</u>\nClinically, each of the Myc or p53 alterations functions as an independent marker of poor prognosis, and alterations in one or the other are detected in a variety of B-cell lymphomas. Notably, lymphomas with co-existent Myc and p53 alterations are synergistic, resulting in more aggressive lymphomas, and patients have a particularly poor prognosis with a short median survival time.7 However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the bidirectional cross-talk between Myc and p53 in B-cell lymphomas have been relatively neglected. Many genes or pathways are involved in the cross-talk between Myc and p53, including Bmi-1, Mel-18, Krueppel-like factor 4 (KLF-4), POXM1, and adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factor (Arf). Additionally, key microRNAs (miRs) (miR-34a and miR17-92) and the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) connect the Myc activation to p53, and play a vital role in some B-cell lymphomas, as shown in Table 1. Although identification of the molecular mechanisms between MYC and TP53 is challenging, the results may help to understand how the lymphoma cells escape apoptosis to develop and progress. Understanding these mechanisms will also provide an opportunity to identify new targets and develop novel agents to improve the therapeutic response in patients with various types of lymphomas.\nThe miRs involved in the cross-talk between p53 and Myc pathways.\n删除重复语句：<u>The miRs involved in the cross-talk between p53 and Myc pathways.</u>\nmiR: microRNA; SIRT1: Sirtuin 1; HDAC3: histone deacetylase 3; DLBCL: diffuse large B cell lymphoma; MCL: mantle cell lymphoma; ALCL: anaplastic large cell lymphoma; GC-DLBCL: germinal center - diffuse large B cell lymphoma; BL: Burkitt lymphoma; HCL: hairy cell leukemia; FL: follicular lymphoma; Bim: Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death; -: not available.\nIn this review, we address the functional role and genetic alterations of MYC and TP53 in normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells, the potential clinical impact of these alterations in understanding the clinical and biological heterogeneity of B-cell lymphomas, and the prospects of targeting Myc and p53 as a part of new therapeutic strategies for these lymphomas. Recent advances have greatly enhanced our understanding of MYC and TP53 and have led to new insights into the mechanisms involved in dysregulated gene expression in various subtypes of lymphomas. This has unraveled cellular targets of mechanism-mediated drug resistance and new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of patients with lymphomas.\nMyc acts as a transcription factor related to numerous physiological functions, and drives the increase in protein synthesis and the cell size of normal pre-transformed B-cells at all stages of B-cell development. Myc is essential and required in the antigen-dependent step of the maturational process of B lymphocytes.8,9,10,11 Antigen naïve B-cells, usually characterized by the expression of surface IgM, encounter specific antigens and are activated with the assistance of T cells, which can trigger the production of the Myc transcription factor and the formation of GC. In the GCs of secondary follicles, B-cells produce the transcription factor B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6), which suppresses the expression of Myc through binding to the promoter of the MYC gene. In addition, Myc is present in B-cells located in the light zone, acquiring high antigen specificity and ensuring the most appropriate gene antigen affinity, which can suppress Bcl-6 expression and re-express Myc. After interacting with activated T cells, B-cells re-enter the dark zone of the GC to proliferate and undergo a series of divisions. Other B-cells in the light zone of the GC experience a different course of development and differentiation. Normally, these B-cells leave the GCs, do not reexpress Myc, downregulate Bcl-6 through the coordinated activity of several signaling pathways, and express B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), which further suppresses Myc . These B-cells become early plasmablasts or eventually memory B cells.2,9 Notably, Myc is required during the initiation and re-entry into the dark zone from the light zone, whereas it is absent in most GC B-cells.删除4：<u>12,13</u>\np53 mediated critical functions within lymphoid cells including the response to genotoxic stress, differentiation, senescence, and cell death.5,14 However, unlike Myc, p53 does not act at a specific phase of the B-cell development and differentiation. P53 functions as the guardian of the genome, which is vital for cellular responses to oxidative stresses, and might be a key coordinator in aging and oxidative stress. In spite of a low or high level of oxidative stress, p53 regulates the expression of a panel of genes involved in the cellular response to oxidative stresses. In response to high levels of oxidative stress, p53 shows pro-oxidative activities that further up-regulate the levels of stress, causing cell death. However, at low levels of oxidative stress p53 exhibits antioxidant activities to eliminate oxidative stress and ensures cell survival.删除4：<u>15</u>\nMyc has strong oncogenic potential and participates in lymphomagenesis.2,8,16 Translocations of MYC into the IGH or IGK/L loci are present in virtually 100% of Burkitt's lymphoma cases and up to 10%-15% of cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Myc expression can be detected immunohistochemically in almost 100% of Burkitt's lymphoma and 30%-50% of DLBCL.11,17MYC rearrangement, as well as Myc overexpression, affects prognosis, especially in cases of DLBCL with overexpression18 or rearrangement of BCL2. Paradoxically, most lymphomas with MYC alterations originate in cells that usually do not express Myc protein, suggesting that the up-regulation of Myc needs additional oncogenic events to overcome Myc regulatory mechanisms and also its pro-apoptotic functions, such as Bcl-6 in GC cells or Blimp-1 in terminally differentiated B-cells,1 which physiologically repress Myc expression in GC B cells and plasma cells, respectively.\nMyc is thought to function as a nonlinear amplifier of expression instead of an on-off specifier of genes, acting universally at active genes.4 B-cell lymphoid malignancies are characterized by an altered signaling of antigen receptors, including, B-cell receptors (BCR), phosphatidylinositol 3＇-kinase (PI3K), Toll-like receptors (TLR) and cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) that are closely associated with Myc18 . Myc interacting with these targets or environmental antigen receptors provides neoplastic B-cells with growth and/or survival signals that play a vital role in the pathogenesis of lymphomas. In many B-cell lymphomas, Myc is constitutively activated more or less strongly and plays a pathogenic role. To a greater extent, Myc is activated because it functions as the major downstream effector of these pathways, conveying pro-survival and proliferation signals, summarized in the following sections.\nThe p19ARF -p53 and Myc-Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) pathways are activated to stimulate proliferation and play a vital role in promoting lymphomagenesis. There are no differences in cell cycle profiles between lymphomas expressing mutant Myc and wild-type, but they both induce lymphoma efficiently. Myc mutants reduce Bim, a BH3-only protein functioning as a member of the Bcl-2 family, to effectively inhibit Bcl-2, leading to abrogation of a parallel apoptotic signal transmitted from Myc to Bim.19 Additionally, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) has a major role in lymphomas initiating pro-B-cells to oppose Bim, which is upregulated in response to the oncogenic stress.20 Wild-type Myc enforces expression of Bcl-2, or loss of either Bim or p53 function to disrupt the apoptosis of lymphoid cells. On the other hand, wild-type Myc can neutralize Bcl-2 by inducing Bim to trigger apoptosis. In contrast, Myc point mutants fail to induce Bim to evade apoptosis, which promotes lymphomas through escaping both wild-type p53 and p19ARF.21 Another molecular mechanism of MYC involved in the lymphomageneses is through protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT 1) (Pias-1) that is often upregulated in B-cell lymphomas. Pias-1 promotes the function of Myc toward the development of mature B-cells, whereas the overexpression of Myc and/or Pias-1 promotes lymphomagenesis, suggesting the possibility of repressing Pias-1 as a therapeutic target22 .\nMiRs interact with Myc acting as a regulatory feedback that can influence the pre- or post-transcriptional expression of multiple genes shown in Table 1. Myc increases expression of both let-7a and miR-34a in DLBCL cells.23 Myc represses several miRs by the recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, including miR15a/16-1, miR26a, miR29, and miR34, which contribute to tumor suppression through deregulation of apoptosis by targeting BCL2 and TP53 (miR15a/16-1 and miR34, respectively), promoting proliferation by targeting CDK6 (miR29a), or cell differentiation by targeting EZH2 (miR26a). On the other hand, Myc itself is also negatively regulated by some miRs, such as miR-34 and miR-494.16 This regulatory loop is complex and still needs elucidation. Further, a positive feedback loop involving miR-26a, miR-29, MYC, and EZH2, exists in both cell lines and primary samples, supporting the presence of a MYC-miR-EZH2 positive feedback loop. Moreover, MYC-miR-26a-EZH2-miR-494 loop and the MYC-EZH2-miR-29 axis have been observed in Mycexpressing lymphoma cell lines and primary lymphoma cells.删除4：<u>24</u>\nTP53 functions as one of the most important genes that regulate the apoptosis. The cellular commitment to apoptosis provides a fundamental benefit to the B-cells, and errors in this process may give rise to lymphoma. Disruption of TP53-dependent apoptosis plays an essential role in the development and progression of lymphoproliferative diseases. Loss of p53 function can result in enhanced rates of cell proliferation, resistance to cell death stimuli, genomic instability, and metastasis.14,25TP53 and p53 dysfunction in lymphoid malignancies can occur at the DNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), or protein level. Point mutations and missense mutations are the main mutations in hematologic malignancies, 90% and 79.9% respectively. Many TP53 mutants inhibit wild type (WT)-p53 function acting in a dominant-negative manner. Single allele mutations are frequently followed by loss of heterozygosity, which further induces lymphoma development.26TP53 mutation acts as a prognosis factor and is linked to worse clinical outcome in patients with DLBCL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma.27,28,29,30 Moreover, small TP53 mutated subclones are associated with a worse prognosis and become predominant under conventional treatment, ultimately causing treatment refractoriness,31 suggesting that increasing the frequency of TP53 mutations in lymphomas increases their clinical aggressiveness and the frequency of these neoplasms being refractory to therapy.\nP53 can be activated by oncogenic stress and DNA damage32 by two distinct signaling pathways that involve the kinase mediated phosphorylation of p53 by inhibition of mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and via p19ARF and the cascade of ATM/CHK2/1, causing p53 protein stabilization, respectively.33,34,35 MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the most important negative regulator of p53. By binding directly to p53, MDM2 mediates ubiquitination-dependent degradation of p53, and by ubiquitinating itself, MDM2 targets itself for destruction and promotes the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.25,34,36,37 Heterodimerization with mouse double minute 4 homolog (MDM4) enhances the E3 activity of MDM2 toward p53, whereas MDM4 can also inhibit the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 under some circumstances. Through the direct binding to p53 at its trans-activation domain, MDM4 represses p53 transcriptional activity. Moreover, MDM4 can downregulate the stability of p53 by promoting MDM2-mediated degradation.37 This regulatory mechanism involved in lymphomagenesis has been illustrated .\nTP53, acting as one of the key tumor suppressor genes, induces activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and the p53 tumor suppressor is one of the first lines of defense against the effects of metabolic changes, hypoxia, genotoxic damage, and oncogene activation.14,15,38 Upon transcriptional induction of genes encoding antioxidant and anti-apoptotic proteins, p53, downregulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), blocks cell apoptosis along the apoptotic pathways.38 Briefly, p53 up-regulates NOXA and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA; also known as Bcl-2- inding component 3 [BBC3]) which are two proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Next, NOXA and PUMA interact with Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak) at the mitochondrial site, and form the signaling complex or apoptosome to initiate apoptosis, followed by activation of the effector caspases-3, -6 and -7 to complete apoptosis. Both p53- induced apoptosis and an increase of radical oxygen species (ROS) are strongly inhibited by the absence of Bax or PUMA.39 DNA damage upregulates stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (Stra6) in a p53-dependent manner and has a critical role in cell death responses. Stra6 expression promotes significant amounts of apoptosis in normal and cancer cells, and influences p53-mediated cell fate decisions by turning an initial arrest response into cell death,39 shown in Fig. 3.\nThe pro-oxidative activities of p53 increase cellular oxidative stresses to induce apoptosis through inhibition of the expression of antioxidant genes. P53 can inhibit expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)40 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2),41 resulting in the induction of apoptosis or enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress.15 P53 and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) act as sensors of the cellular responses to stress and one of the main anti-oxidant enzymes, and are involved in these processes. P53 could repress SOD2 gene expression at the promoter level whereas overexpression of MnSOD decreases p53-mediated induction of apoptosis.40 Additionally, p53 induces cell cycle arrest via p21, inhibiting proliferation and serving as one of the major transcriptional targets of p53,42,43 and p21WAF1/Cip1 regulates cell proliferation by inhibiting the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes at the G1/S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints.删除4：<u>44</u>\nMiRs are also key factors to maintain the normal TP53 pathway, joining forces with MDM2 and MDM4 to guarantee proper p53 activity,45 as shown in Table 1. The dysregulation of these miRs is associated with poor clinical outcomes.46 For example, miRs trans-activated by p53 in lymphocytes include miR-15a, miR-16-1 which targets oncogene MYB, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1,47 and enhances expression of the LEU2 gene,48 a locus deleted in 55% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases (del13q14). Among the miRs, the miR-34 family (miR-34a, b, c), directly targets p53 transcription and plays a vital role in the TP53 network involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence, and its loss can cause resistance to p53-mediated apoptosis.46,49,50 MiR-34b and miR-34c, targeting Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70), are deleted in 18% of CLL cases (del11q).47 MiR-34a targets FOXP1, BCL2, and can block B-cell development when overexpressed,51 whereas reduced miR-34a expression has been correlated with inferior overall survival (OS) in patients with DLBCL52 and significantly shorter treatment-free survival in CLL patients.53 The regulation of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) by miR- 34a is part of a positive feedback loop. SIRT1 can deacetylate and inactivate p53 resulting in impaired cell growth arrest and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress, whereas TP53 upregulates miR-34 expression that, in turn, promotes p53 by inhibiting SIRT1,50,51,54 suggesting that the precise gene dose regulation by miRs has vital regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas .\nClinically, MYC-rearrangement (MYC-R), Myc expression, loss of TP53, TP53 mutations, and high expression of p53 are associated with lymphomas that arise from GC B cells. Expression of Myc or p53 is often higher in clinically aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHLs).55,56 Although expression of Myc or P53 individually has been shown to contribute to poor survival in DLBCL patients, the role of MYC-R or Myc expression associated TP53 genetic alterations or p53 expression has been relatively neglected.\nConcurrent Myc and p53 expression impacts the prognosis of patients with B-cell lymphoma.35MYC-R or p53 expression alone are independent prognostic factors for DLBCL patients, whereas those with concurrent p53 expression and MYC-R display a worse prognosis. Ye et al57 and Xie et al58 have reported that Myc expression is similarly distributed between the GC B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC) subtypes; however, the GCB-DLBCL patients with high Myc expression had a higher frequency of TP53 mutation.59 In other studies, patients with DLBCL without Myc and p53 expression had the best overall survival. In contrast, patients with DLBCL harboring MYC-R or Myc expression and p53 expression had significantly worse OS, regardless of Bcl-2 expression status,7,60,61 suggesting that p53 enhances the negative prognostic effect of Myc expression in DLBCL patients.7,62 Theoretically, dysregulation of Myc and p53 promotes tumor proliferation and apoptosis, and has a synergistic effect on tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy, similar to the recent reports on double expressor DLBCL with Myc and Bcl-2 coexpression. Data regarding Myc and p53 being involved in bidirectional cross-talk in B-cell lymphomas are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table 2.\nExpression and prognoses of p53 and Myc in GCB and non-GCB subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\n删除重复语句：<u>Expression and prognoses of p53 and Myc in GCB and non-GCB subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</u>\nGCB: germinal center diffuse large B cell lymphoma; Non-GCB: non-germinal center diffuse large B cell lymphoma;MYC-R: MYC-rearrangement; MUT: mutation; WT: wild type; OS: overall survival; NA: not available.\na Mean ± SE. SE: standard error.\nb Median.\nThe first cross-talk mechanism lies in the ability of Myc to inhibit Bmi-1 and Mel-18, and KLF-4 and POXM1 (which regulate Bmi-1); Bmi-1 inhibits Arf. Mounting evidence suggests that Arf has critical p53-independent tumor-suppressor functions, supported by the findings that TP53 and CDKN2A are frequently and simultaneously inactivated in human cancers.63 Moreover, p19ARF downregulates MDM2 and Arf-BP1, which mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53, resulting in the accumulation of p53 protein involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence. Additionally, Bmi-1 serves a key role in this pathway from Myc to p53, and its biological functions including development, cell cycle, DNA damage response, senescence, stem cells, self-renewal, and cancer. In Bmi-1-deficient mice, expression of Ink4a and Arf is greatly increased in the hematopoietic cells, leading to the cell cycle arrest and p53-dependent apoptosis, respectively.64 Bmi-1 collaborates with Myc in inducing proliferation and transformation of primary embryo fibroblasts in an Ink4a-ARF dependent manner, which is associated with prohibiting Myc-mediated induction of p19ARF and apoptosis.65,66,67,68 Bmi-1 can also directly mediate the stability of p53, further negatively regulating cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis through the retinoblastoma protein (pRb)-p53 pathway.删除4：<u>67,69</u>\nMeanwhile, Bmi-1 is positively mediated by forkhead box protein M1 (Foxm-1), E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F-1), and Sal-like protein 4 (Sall-4), whereas KLF4, Mel-18, and HDAC inhibitors suppress the expression at the transcriptional level. In addition, Mel-18 reduces Bmi-1 expression by inhibiting Myc, forming a positive regulator of Bmi-1.删除4：<u>70</u>\nMiR-34a and miR17-92 are the key miRs that connect Myc activation to p53 and play a vital pathogenic role in some B-cell lymphomas. miR-34a is inhibited by Myc and is transcriptionally activated by p53.45,46 MiR-34a is reported to have tumorsuppressive activity in DLBCL cell lines23 and its expression is mediated by Myc, or through mechanisms that may involve epigenetic silencing of the miR-34a promoter or chromosomal deletion of the miR-34a genomic locus.71,72,73 MiR-34a is also closely associated with TP53 through a feedback loop in which TP53 promotes miR-34 expression that, in turn, activates p53 through SIRT1 inhibition. Recently, miR-34a was shown to also target MDM4.45,74 On the other hand, although most miRs directly regulated by Myc are usually repressed, Myc up-regulates the oncogenic miR17-92 cluster. The miR17-92 polycistron at 13q31 is commonly amplified in several subtypes of aggressive lymphomas, and its oncogenic function is regulated partly by the down-regulation of TP53, PTEN, and E2F1, facilitating the activation of the PI3K/AKT (protein kinase B, PKB) pathway and apoptosis inhibition, respectively.\nEBV, a ubiquitous herpes virus, has a tendency to preferentially infect B lymphocytes and plays an important role in some EBV-associated B-cell lymphomas, in which Epstein-Barr viral nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) regulates Myc positively whereas EBNA3A and EBNA3C repress Arf, which forms a regulatory loop among EBV, Myc and p53.75,76 EBV latent antigens (EBNA1, EBNA2 and EBNA3C) are essential for in vitro B-cell immortalization leading to the continuously proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). DNA damage of LCLs knocked down for EBNA3C experienced a drastic promotion of apoptosis, as a possible outcome of both p53-and E2F1-regulated activities. Mechanistically, EBNA3C inhibits E2F1 transcriptional activity via blocking its DNA binding activity at the responsive promoters of p73 and apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) apoptosis inducing genes, and also facilitates E2F1 degradation in an ubiquitin-proteasome dependent fashion.删除4：<u>77</u>\nThese results suggest that TP53 and MYC mutations are present in all types of lymphomas, which may help the tumor cells to escape the apoptotic effects of Myc; however, the details of the cross-talk mechanisms between Myc and p53 remain unclear. Through the cross-talk between Myc and p53, a number of genes and pathways are intimately connected in the development and progression of neoplastic B-cells, which participate in the construction of a complex biological network in B-cell lymphomas. Identification of the molecular mechanism between Myc and p53 is difficult as a large number of genes and pathways can be influenced by various factors. However, elucidating these mechanisms will greatly enhance our understanding of Myc and p53, and will lead to new insights into the mechanisms involved in the dysregulated gene expression in various types of B-cell lymphomas, and lead to the development of cellular targeting agents to overcome drug resistance in patients with lymphomas.\nMyc and p53 are widely present in normal and tumor cells, and play important roles in lymphomagenesis. However, the use of Myc and p53 inhibitors affects the cycle of normal cells, often clinically, resulting in adverse side effects in the patients. Although it is predicted that long-term treatment of lymphoma patients with Myc and/or p53 inhibitors eventually impairs the immune function, short-term administration of such agents might be possible and manageable. Technically, Myc and p53 can be inhibited by targeting the Myc components directly or indirectly by inhibiting the upstream signaling pathway components, and Myc inhibition also interrupts p53 as a result of being downregulated by Myc. Therefore, combining Myc or p53 inhibitors with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs is a rational and logical therapeutic strategy that is currently being evaluated in trials. Therefore, optimization of the combination and personalized approaches is important and needs to be well defined. Here, we summarize the current research directions for targeted therapy of Myc and p53 pathways, in Fig. 5 and Table 3.\nOngoing clinical trials of novel agents in patients with different types of cancers with TP53.\n删除重复语句：<u>Ongoing clinical trials of novel agents in patients with different types of cancers with TP53.</u>\nMDM2: mouse double minute 2 homolog.\nTargeting Myc might be an alternative strategy for treating lymphoma patients. HDAC inhibitors are able to reduce the expression of Myc,24,78 whereas PI3K inhibitors can decrease Myc family protein stability by disrupting their regulation at the post-transcriptional level.79,80 CUDC-907, an oral small selective molecular inhibitor of both HDAC (class I and II) and PI3K (class Iα, β, and δ) enzymes, has shown a promising outcome with rituximab in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory (R/R) DLBCL.81,82,83 In a phase I trial, CUDC-907 was used in R/R DLBCL including patients with MYC-alterations, and the results showed an objective response rate in the evaluable patients of 64% (7 of 11; 4 complete responses and 3 partial responses), compared with 29% (2 of 7) in patients with MYC unaltered DLBCL. The median duration of response was 13.6 months in MYC-altered DLBCL versus 6 months in MYC unaltered DLBCL patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 21.8 months (range, 1.0-25.4 months) for MYC-altered DLBCL patients, with a median PFS of 21.8 months (range, 1.0-16.4 months) for patients treated with monotherapy, and was not reached in patients treated with rituximab combined with CUDC-907. In comparison, the median PFS in MYC negative DLBCL patients was 1.3 months (range, 0.4-15.5 months). The most frequently reported grade ≥3 treatmentrelated events were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and anemia,81 suggesting that CUDC-907 is well tolerated and long-lasting stabilization of the disease can be obtained in MYC-altered, R/R DLBCL patients, as shown in Fig. 5.\nOther potential therapeutic targets of Myc include bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) and runtrelated transcription factor (Runx). Brd4 is essential for MYC transcription to address its regulatory function, and is a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) subfamily of proteins. Delmore et al68,84 used JQ1, a small-molecule inhibitor of BET bromodomains, to selectively downregulate MYC transcription in the treatment of human multiple myeloma cells. In myeloma models of MYC-dependent hematologic malignancy, JQ1 shows an active antiproliferative effect related to cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Overall survival was increased in JQ1 treated mice compared to the vehicle control. These studies offer a challenge to treat lymphomas with high Myc expression, and additional clinical trials are needed to better address the role of CUDC-907 in targeting Myc .\nLenalidomide functions as an immunomodulatory drug, but can also repress Myc and its target genes and proteins in plasma cells harboring MYC rearrangement. In a human tumor xenograft model, interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) was the target gene of the tumoricidal effect of lenalidomide, as the upregulation of IRF4, a hallmark of ABC subtype DLBCL, was associated with high Myc expression. Lenalidomide decreases IRF4 levels in multiple myeloma cell lines and bone marrow samples with high levels of Myc85,86,87,88. A recent trial showed that lenalidomide combined with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) appears to be particularly beneficial in non-GCB DLBCL, including Myc-positive DLBCL and highgrade B-cell lymphomas (features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt's lymphoma with a poor prognosis), showing no difference in the 24-month PFS or OS on the basis of non-GCB and GCB subtype (60% vs. 59% [P ＝0.83] and 83% vs. 75% [P ＝0.61] at 2 years, respectively). This trial will be one of the first trials to offer up-front adjusted treatment for Mycpositive DLBCL patients, with probably better treatment outcomes in these patients.88 Lenalidomide is synergistic with R-CHOP and overcomes high-risk Myc-positive DLBCL with a poor prognosis, providing valuable insights into the synergistic effect, and this combination is a potential treatment for patients with R/R B-cell lymphomas.\nIbrutinib, a first-in-class, oral, irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a cytoplasmic signaling molecule situated downstream of the BCR, has shown promising results in the treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies89 . In a phase II, single-arm study, single-agent ibrutinib was used to treat 51 patients with previously untreated (n＝35) and R/R (n＝16) high-risk CLL with TP53 aberrations.90 This study showed persistent responses in patients with CLL with TP53 aberrations, especially in patients with previously untreated disease. This response to ibrutinib was equivalent to the response in TP53 wild-type CLL cells, suggesting a p53-independent mechanism of action. Furthermore, histological transformation rates of CLL appeared to be lower than in CLL patients treated with conventional chemotherapy when used first line, emphasizing the role of up-front ibrutinib in patients with TP53 aberrations.91 Moreover, in another single-arm phase Ib/II study, the PFS of all patients with TP53 mutation was 78% with an OS of 83.8% at 18 months.删除4：<u>91,92</u>\nOther studies support many novel agents that may have potential as therapy for B-cell lymphomas with TP53 mutation.93 Targeting the p53/p21 axis might be an alternative treatment strategy. RO-3306, a cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) inhibitor, is able to modulate the balance of p53 functions, which blocks cell-cycle arrest by inhibiting p53-mediated activation of p21, and enhances apoptosis by reducing levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2, survivin, and MDM2 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines with WT-p53 . X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) functions as a p53/p21 axis regulator through MDM2 in many cancers regardless of the p53 status (wild-type or mutant). Further, XBP1 suppression induces G0-G1 phase arrest and represses cell proliferation by negatively regulating the p53/p21 axis and enhancing p53 ubiquitination, which in turn down-regulates p21 expression94 as shown in Fig. 5. However, no clinical trials have been performed using inhibitors of the p53/p21 axis in patients with B-cell lymphomas, and additional clinical trials are needed to better address the role of these agents to target p53 in B-cell lymphomas.删除4：<u>6,95</u>\nRapamycin, which targets mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is an important mediator of intracellular signaling in B cells. Rapamycin and other rapalogs, including everolimus and temsirolimus, inhibit the activity of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) by binding to mTOR, and it has been verified in vivo that everolimus can downregulate AKT activity in hematopoietic cells96 . Further, everolimus has been shown to have clinical activity in a variety of B cell lymphomas including CLL with TP53 deletion/mutation.97 R/R CLL patients with TP53 disruption or purine analogue refractory disease had a short survival prior to the recent introduction of BCR and Bcl-2 inhibitor therapy. Clinical trials illustrated that alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 antibody) combined with high dose methylprednisolone therapy used in 22 R/R patients with CLL and TP53 deletion/mutation achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 77%, median PFS of 6.5 months and median OS of 19.5 months. In this study, everolimus and alemtuzumab reportedly had ORR rates and PFS similar to those of alemtuzumab monotherapy, but with a longer median OS.98 These data highlight that combined later generation mTOR inhibitors with less toxic B cell targeted drugs, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or small molecule inhibitors, could provide a direction in designing future clinical trials in CLL or other B cell lymphomas.删除4：<u>97</u>\nOther agents or small molecular inhibitors have been studied. For example, arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been found to induce expression of Pirh2 E3 ligase at the transcriptional level, degrading mutant p53 for polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation . Moreover, ATO can cooperate with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) or HDAC inhibitors, as well as induce the Pirh2-dependent proteasome pathway to promote mutant p53 degradation and growth suppression in tumor cells.99 Another target, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), acts as an oncogene in patients with high-risk DLBCL with an active host inflammatory response; targeting STAT1 mediated by BAL1 might be a strategy to increase the sensitivity of DLBCL towards classic therapy.100 In all, these outcomes could pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for clinical trials for the treatment of p53-associated B-cell lymphomas.\nBoth Myc and p53 are closely associated with physiological cellular functions, including immune response and lymphocyte survival, and are expressed in lymphoid organs in which the development and activation of B-cell malignancies occurs. However, Myc and p53 also have an anti-apoptotic role and the activation of these pathways is a common feature in various malignancies, independent of the cell of origin. Aberrant or mutant MYC contributes to lymphomagenesis by interacting with lymphoid cells or environmental antigen receptors, providing neoplastic B-cells with growth and/or survival signals, but MYC aberrations alone are insufficient to induce lymphomagenesis. TP53 dysfunction can result in enhanced rates of cell proliferation, resistance to cell death stimuli, genomic instability, and metastasis. As previously known, many genes and pathways are involved in the process of lymphoma transformation, constituting the regulating molecular web. For these reasons, the B-cell lymphomas function as preferential models for the action of Myc and p53; the cross-talk between Myc and p53 contributes to an inferior prognosis for patients with many B-cell neoplasms. Further knowledge of the cross-talk mechanisms is essential to better define the relationship and effect in each B-cell lymphoma subtype.\nMYC and TP53 are an Achilles heel in many B-cell lymphomas, and therapies targeting these pathways have preliminarily shown encouraging therapeutic effects with minimal toxicity in patients with these diseases. Therefore, new agents designed to specifically target the MYC and TP53 pathways are being studied and developed. However, these agents, used as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, have failed to achieve a favorable outcome and overcome tumor resistance. Further studies with the multitude of available agents are needed to create diverse possibilities for targeted therapy, and the outcomes will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of Myc and p53 in each type of B-cell lymphoma, as well as provide an opportunity to improve the therapeutic response for various types of lymphomas. Moreover, the goal in treating patients with B-cell lymphoma should be to combine Myc and p53 targeted inhibitors rationally and synergistically block several pathways, inducing apoptosis, and hopefully achieving efficacious treatment with less toxicity.\nAll authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 81460030 and 81770221 to LY.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2019.08.001</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Malaria was terminated with chloroquine after 10-20 malarial febrile episodes. Clinical assessments were made before(baseline), during(malarial phase)and after(post)termination of malaria. The density of Plasmodia in peripheral blood from the HIV/AIDS patients were compared to that from HIV-negative naturally infected malarial patients who donated the blood for the therapeutically induced malaria.

However, it was found that the HIV-positive patients had milder malarial symptoms and parasitemia with progressively lower CD4 cell baseline levels. All patients developed every day or every other day fever episodes with headache and shaking chill. These symptoms were well tolerated with the aid of anti-pyretic medications. Spleen and liver enlargement were seen in 15 of 20 and 4 of 20 patients respectively.

Exosomes derived from ADSCs (ADSCs-Exos) have excellent tissue repair functions, including high vascular endothelial growth factor A, fibroblast growth factor 2, hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor subunit BB, and other important wound healing factors.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Supplementary Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A828 is a simplified diagram of the exosome formation and release model.\nWound healing refers to a series of pathophysiological processes in which local tissues undergo regeneration, repair, and reconstruction after tissue loss caused by injury factors. It involves inflammation, angiogenesis, proliferation, tissue remodeling, and scar repair. In recent years, with the increasing research on ADSCs-Exos, their potential applications in promoting or supporting wound healing have become research hotspots. In contrast to traditional therapy, it achieves healing effect by activating the wound healing mechanism. Herein, we discuss in detail the roles of ADSC-Exos in various stages of wound healing 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Figure 2, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A829]</u>.\nIn the early stage of wound healing, inflammatory phenomena such as hyperemia, white blood cell infiltration, and local redness and swelling are observed. The anti-inflammatory function of ADSC-Exos is mainly related to its protein and RNA. In addition, macrophages play a crucial role in the inflammatory phase of wound healing. In both normal and diabetic mice, the accumulation of monocytes or macrophages in the wound could significantly accelerate the speed of wound healing. ADSC-Exos could be transferred into macrophages. Argininase-1 is activated by the active signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) carried by exosomes, inducing macrophages to polarize to the M2 phenotype, thereby reducing the inflammatory response. Li et al通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> reported the effect of ADSC-Exos overexpressing nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) for the treatment of diabetic rats, and found that ADSC-Exos overexpressing Nrf2 can significantly reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- 1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α.\nAngiogenesis is a key step in wound healing. It is a complex and highly regulated process involving the expression of various angiogenic factors. Yang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> explored the effect of ADSC-Exos on cerebral vascular remodeling. The results of the capillary network formation experiment showed that exosomal microRNA-181b-5p upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and accelerated the migration and formation rates of cerebral vascular endothelial cells after hypoxia and glucose treatments. Moreover, miR-21 overexpression of ADSC-Exos was found to significantly promote the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. ADSC-Exos overexpressed by miR-21 could promote angiogenesis by activating the Akt, also called protein kinase B, and extra-cellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathways, and the expressions of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and stromal cell derived factor-1.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> ADSC-Exos contain vascular growth factors such as thrombopoietin, milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8, and angiopoietin-like protein 1. Matrix metalloproteinases carried by exosomes can promote the activation of angiogenic factors, thus greatly increasing the activity of angiogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Lu et al通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> found that ADSC-Exos increased miR-486-5p level, which obviously promoted angiogenesis of human mammary epithelial cells. Notably, this effect was realized by miR-486-5p through its target gene Sp5. Xu et al通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> systematically studied the effect of microRNAs on angiogenesis. The results of real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that miR-423-5p and miR-21-5p had the maximum enrichment in ADSC-Exos. The authors also verified that miR-423-5p was the critical and most abundant miRNA in ADSC-Exos for promoting angiogenesis.\nThe proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts mark the beginning of new tissue formation. Zhang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> isolated normal human dermal fibroblasts and ADSC-Exos from patient dermal and adipose tissue. Real-time cell analysis, cell counting kit-8 analysis, and cell scraping experiments showed that proliferation and migration of fibroblasts treated with exosomes were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner compared with untreated cells. After exosome stimulation, the mRNA and protein levels of type I collagen, type III collagen, transforming growth factor beta 1, and basic fibroblast growth factor in fibroblasts were increased. Notably, exogenous ADSC-Exos can promote collagen expression only in the early stage of wound repair, while in the later stage of wound repair, collagen production is inhibited.\nThe signaling pathway of wound healing is complex, and involves various overlapping stages of wound repair. Zhang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> evaluated the effect of ADSC-Exos on wound repair using a mouse model of incision wound and found that ADSC-Exos could facilitate the proliferation and migration of human fibroblasts and increase collagen formation through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway. Growth factors such as PDGF, epidermal growth factor, TGF-β, VEGF, and insulin like growth factor-1 play a role by activating this signaling pathway. Ma et al通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> treated human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells with hydrogen peroxide to study its therapeutic effect on skin diseases. The results showed that ADSC-Exos could reduce apoptosis by promoting the proliferation and migration of HaCaT cells. In addition, the experiment also showed that ADSC-Exos may promote skin wound healing by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway. Zhang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> showed that ADSC-Exos can up-regulate AKT phosphorylation level and HIF-1α expression in HaCaT cells. ADSC-Exos treated with hypoxia can activate the protein kinase A signaling pathway and promote the expression of VEGF to accelerate wound healing. Studies have shown that ADSC-Exos significantly increased the expression of miR-19b in recipient cells, and miR-19b targets chemokine cc-motif ligand 1 to regulate the TGF-β pathway thereby accelerating skin wound healing.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>\nThe signaling pathways of ADSC-Exos that are known to promote wound healing include TGF-β, ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK/MAPK), PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, Janus kinase-STAT (JAK-STAT), which are involved in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, and apoptosis. They are different but interrelated signaling pathways 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nThe TGF-β signaling pathway. The TGF-β family ligand dimer forms complexes with the corresponding type II and type I receptors on the membrane 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. The type I receptor is phosphorylated by the type II receptor and activates its activity. Thereafter, the type I receptor recruits and activates the downstream Smad protein. Smad2/3 is phosphorylated and binds to Smad4, and after translocation into the nucleus, it acts as a nuclear factor to participate in the transcriptional regulation of target genes. The ERK/MAPK signaling pathway 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. It involves the sequential activation of rat sarcoma, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and ERK. Activated ERK further activates downstream pathways, and these kinases are activated sequentially to jointly regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, stress inflammation, and other multiple responses. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. PI3K is a dimer composed of the regulatory subunit p85 and the catalytic subunit p110. When it binds to growth factor receptors (such as epidermal growth factor receptor), it activates Akt, which is phosphorylated and subsequently activates downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) targets. Activated Rheb directly regulates mTORC1 and regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration phenotypes. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. When WNT binds to the membrane receptor Frizzled, the intra-cellular protein dishevelled is activated and stabilizes the free β-catenin protein in the cytoplasm. β-Catenin then enters the nucleus and binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor transcription factors, thereby activating downstream target gene transcription. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. Various cytokines/growth factors bind to receptors and can be phosphorylated to activate JAK, phosphorylate tyrosine residues of downstream target proteins, and recruit and phosphorylate transcription factor STAT, which then enters the nucleus as a dimer. STAT binds to target genes, regulates the transcription of downstream genes as well as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. There are few studies on the mechanisms of ADSC-Exos in promoting wound healing, and extensive research is needed in the future.\nOur future research will focus on using ADSC-Exos in combination with other biological materials to promote wound healing or use it after co-cultivation with other types of mesenchymal stem cell exosomes with the same function. Recent studies have shown that gene over-expression can also promote wound healing. A promising way to accelerate wound healing is to use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats gene editing technology. Implanting the edited gene after overexpression or structural modification into the human body, and interacting with exosomes may produce positive effects. In summary, the research on effects of ADSC-Exos on wound healing is in its infancy, and numerous experimental studies are needed to confirm and optimize this new cell-free treatment strategy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

No lymphadenopathy was observed. Neurological examinations revealed no abnormalities.\nPreoperative computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed large, irregular, and well defined lesions in the posterior part of bilateral lateral ventricles, the triangle area, and the temporal horn, based on the dural membrane. The lesions on the right and left were about 9.2 cm and 9.1 cm in diameter, respectively. The lesions exhibited heterogeneous density on CT scans, were isointense on T1-weighted MRI, were slightly hypointense on T2-weighted MRI, and were avid and unevenly enhanced on contrast medium administration. There were high-density flakes in the lesion in the CT scan, which were hypointense on T1- and hyperintense on T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images . No evidence of any calcification was noted.\nLaboratory examinations revealed slightly increased fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, D-dimer on quantitative detections, and prolonged activation of partial thromboplastin. The results of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hemoglobin, neutrophil count, red blood-cell count, thyroxine, prolactin, cortisol levels, and further routine hematological and biochemical tests were normal.\nThe clinical diagnosis was intraventricular RDD. The lesions were bilateral and huge, so we decided to resect in stages. The right one was larger and was first resected to relieve the symptoms. Through parieto-occipital sulcus approach, under ultrasound guidance, yellow-white, solid, leather-like, hypervascular nodules  with clear boundaries, tight adhesion, and overall size of 9 cm × 6 cm × 5 cm, in both ventricles, were completely removed. The interval between two operations was 3 months. The lesions were completely removed, as confirmed by postoperative CT.\nHistopathological examinations revealed emperipolesis, a lymphocytic engulfment by the proliferative histiocytes, and chronic inflammation with lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration in hyperplastic fibrous stroma. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the histiocytes were positive for cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68) and S100 proteins in a scattered or disordered manner and negative for CD1a, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and IgG4 . Finally, the lesions were diagnosed as intracranial RDD.\nSix months later, the patient was admitted to the ophthalmology ward for poor vision. During fundus photography and fluorography, round, orange-yellow uplifts of about 3 × 4 pupillary distance size and spotted pigmentations could be seen in the posterior poles of both eyes . They were considered to be choroidal osteoma of fundus of both eyes. A regular follow-up was recommended.\nFifteen months after the second operation, blurred vision still existed while facial paralysis (H-B I degree), giggle, and cognitive impairment disappeared. MRI and contrast scans revealed that the bilateral ventricles were smaller, and no new or recurring lesions were found .\nMost cases of intracranial RDD present with isolated lesions.1,2,4,8,11 Twenty-eight isolated cases of intracranial RDD with multiple lesions, and three systemic ones, have been reported. Among eight intraventricular cases  in the literature, the lesions were all isolated, with five multiple ones and three single ones.删除4：<u>2,7,12,13,14,15</u>\nClinical manifestations of intracranial RDD are not specific and vary greatly in location, size, and number of lesions. Common sites of intracranial RDD consist of the cerebral convexity, the cranial base, the parasagittal and the suprasellar regions, the cavernous sinus, and the petroclival region, and most lesions are attached to the dura.2,5,12 RDD can also be primary in the brain parenchyma, but this is very rare and it can be misdiagnosed as lymphoma or metastatic tumor.删除4：<u>16</u>\nImaging is significant in intracranial RDD diagnosis. The lesions in our case were well defined and dural based, exhibited heterogeneous density on CT scans, were isointense on T1-weighted MRI, were slightly hypointense on T2-weighted MRI, and were avid and unevenly enhanced on contrast medium administration.1,2,4,10,12,17 To the best of our knowledge, our case was the first to describe an intracranial RDD case with an internal hemorrhage on CT scans. The large size of the lesions leads us to believe that the hemorrhage may be caused by a rupture of proliferating blood vessels.3,5,10 Zhang et al.18 also reported a case of RDD with necrosis and calcification on CT scans.18 Hemorrhage, necrosis, and calcification on CT scans cannot help rule out the diagnosis of RDD.\nIntraventricular tumors in children, meningioma, and choroid plexus papilloma are the first to be differentiated from RDD. Meningiomas are hypo-iso-hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI with clear borders. They are hypervascular in angiography and show increased alanine peaks in the proton spectrum. Bone changes often accompany them, like bone hyperplasia, bone destruction, and calcification. RDD is generally an irregular solid mass with a low signal on T2-weighted MRI, hypovascular features, and no bone changes. Lipid and N-acetyl aspartate peaks elevate owing to features of granulomatous inflammation, and choline peaks also raise. Choroid plexus papilloma is also a highly vascularized mass with a high signal on T2-weighted MRI. The mulberry-like imaging features can help distinguish it from RDD.删除4：<u>3,19</u>\nHistopathological analysis is the gold standard to establish a diagnosis of intracranial RDD. Emperipolesis is a hallmark of RDD and may relate to immune response abnormalities. The phenomenon is not unique, however, and may also exist in leukemic processes. Emperipolesis can be observed in only 70% of RDD cases and even less in intracranial ones.1,2,3,4,5,7,8,12,20 In immunohistochemical examination, RDD lesions show positive for S-100 protein, CD68, α1-antitrypsin, lysozymes, MAC-378 but negative for CD1a, GFAP and epithelial membrane antigen, displaying characteristics of antigen presenting cells and phagocytic histiocytes.4,7,12,20 Yang et al.7 revealed 15/high power field IgG4 positive lymphocytes in RDD lesions, which may explain why some RDD lesions respond to steroid therapy like IgG4-related disease.\nIn laboratory diagnoses, we found that the child had increased fibrinogen quantity and prolonged activation of partial thromboplastin, which had not been reported in other literature.1,2,5 We therefore believe that laboratory tests may not be specific, and the abnormal coagulation function of our patient may be related to RDD itself involving the blood and lymphatic systems.\nSurgery is the cornerstone for the management of multiple intracranial RDD with a favorable prognosis. The lesions in our case were bilateral and huge, so surgery was under-taken to relieve compression symptoms. Among 28 isolated multiple intracranial RDD lesions mentioned above, most of them were removed surgically in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for residual lesions. Twenty-one patients were alive (20 patients with stable masses and 1 patient with enlarged mass), two patients died of RDD, one patient died of respiratory failure, and four patients were unknown. For the eight patients with intraventricular RDD, six received surgical treatment only, one received surgical treatment combined with chemoradiotherapy, and one received drainage and steroids. In the follow-up, five patients were in stable condition, one patient’s mass enlarged, one patient died, and one patient did not provide a follow-up result.删除4：<u>2,7,12,13,14,15</u>\nStaged surgery and appropriate surgical intervals help children to tolerate surgical treatment and obtain a good prognosis. The overall fluid volume in children is lower than that in adults. When the volume of blood loss is certain, children are at higher risk of hemorrhagic shock than adults. Excessive operation time may increase the risk from anesthesia.\nConsequently, we adopted the strategy of staged surgery and the second operation was performed 3 months later. The prognosis of the child was good. Ma et al.21 reported 50 cases with pediatric intracranial tumors who underwent staged resection. All the tumors were totally removed without any serious outcome such as death, coma, or hemiplegia. They recommended 3-5 months interval between operations.21 We also support that for staging operations of RDD, an interval of 3-5 months is appropriate.\nPostoperative treatment is not uniform in adults or children. In this patient, staging surgery removed the tumors completely. Complete excision is ideal, because no recurrence after complete resection has been reported in intracranial RDD, while the recurrence rate with subtotal resection is about 14%.3,8 The curative effects of postoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or steroid for RDD vary individually and they all have certain side effects.1,2,3,4,5,7,12,20,22,23,24,25,26 We therefore recommend active follow-up with MRI. Once the condition deteriorates, radiotherapy and chemotherapy may play a role.\nIn our case, the symptoms of blurred vision still existed 6 months after the second surgery, and the ophthalmology department suggested bilateral choroid osteoma. As far as we know, RDD with choroid osteoma has not been reported in other literature. Mehraein et al.17 also reported four RDD patients with huge numbers of parvovirus B19-positive cells in their tissues, indicating a variety of inflammatory vasculitis. One of them had concomitant RDD and Takayasu arteritis.17 We suspect that RDD may be related to other specific abnormal histiocytic proliferation diseases. More experiments are needed to confirm this.\nIn conclusion, multiple huge bilateral intraventricular masses of children need to be differentiated for RDD. Surgery is the first line of treatment and staged resection is helpful for perioperative safety. Operation time intervals ranging from 3 to 5 months are advisable and active follow-up with MRI is necessary.\nSupplementary information", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The World Health Organization reported that 47.5 million people were affected by dementia worldwide in 2015. The social and economic implications are enormous, resulting in an estimated annual global societal cost of 604 billion dollars, corresponding to 1.0% of the worldwide gross domestic product.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The three most common dementia subtypes are Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and mixed dementia (combined AD and VaD pathology), among which AD is the most common type, accounting for 60–70% of all cases, with a prevalence of approximately 1% in those aged 60–64 years, which increases to 40% in those aged 85 years or older.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> VaD accounts for a further 17–25% of cases,通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> with an estimated prevalence rates of 1.6% and 1.7% in Europe通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> and China,通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> respectively. However, many people have mixed AD/VaD. Vascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and smoking can contribute to both VaD and AD, and approximately one-third of AD cases are due to modifiable vascular risk factors通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> because of their potential impact on the neurovascular unit.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Due to the increasing life expectancy of the population, there is an urgent need to control vascular risk factors and to identify therapies to prevent and treat both cognitive impairment and dementia. Here, we reviewed the association between plasma lipids and cognition function and the underlying mechanisms.\nIn the Finnish study titled Cardiovascular Risk Factors Aging and Dementia, midlife measures of total cholesterol were significant predictors of cognitive impairment. Moreover, it was shown that a high midlife cholesterol level increased the risk for VaD.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Some studies have reported that higher levels of late-life cholesterol were associated with a higher risk of VaD. In contrast, a longitudinal study of 1159 elderly Chinese individuals found associations between the elevated levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the accelerated cognitive decline.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> The literatures generally suggest that the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia is associated with hypertriglyceridemia, high LDL levels, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u> A large cohort study (n = 7087) showed that a high triglyceride level was the only component of metabolic syndrome that was significantly associated with the incidence of VaD (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.27); no such association was found for AD (HR: 0.90).通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Hypertriglyceridemia-induced/associated atherosclerosis might contribute to cognitive decline in patients with type 2 diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Panza et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> noted that hypertriglyceridemia was associated with increased risk of dementia syndromes, particularly VaD. An elevated LDL level is particularly atherogenic and may be closely related to VaD.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> A Swedish study (n = 60) found that higher apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels at baseline predicted dementia at least 3 years later, although all forms of dementia were included in this small study.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> One study also indicated that the ApoB/LDL ratio might be a potential clinical index for vascular cognitive impairment.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>\nMost cross-sectional studies that included participants aged over 75 years showed an association between increased HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and better performance on cognitive tests.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> In addition, a prospective study has confirmed the association of lower ApoA-I levels with increased dementia risk.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> A higher ApoB/ApoA-I ratio increased the risk of cognitive decline over 2 years in cognitively normal individuals.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Therefore, an elevated ApoA-I level and a decreased ApoB/ApoA-I ratio might be associated with decreased dementia risk.\nIn contrast, one study found that higher levels of late-life cholesterol were associated with a lower risk for VaD.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Other large studies of older adults have found an association of high triglyceride通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> and LDL levels with better cognitive performance.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Furthermore, in a recent longitudinal study of 192 adults with AD, rising LDL levels were associated with a trend toward improvement in functional performance.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>\nRecently, one study reported that high total serum cholesterol in late life was not associated with MCI, AD, VaD, any form of dementia, or cognitive decline.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Vicario et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> reported that only dyslipidemia was unrelated to cognitive impairment in the Cardiovascular Prevention Program (n = 1365). The latest research showed that late-life measurements of HDL-C and triglycerides were not associated with increased risk of VaD, and HDL-C was not associated with the risk of MCI, AD, or any form of dementia.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> A pooled analysis of two Finnish prospective population-based cohort studies (n = 13,275) found that the baseline ApoB level was not associated with incident AD or dementia 10 years later.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>\nThe relationship between plasma lipids and cognition is very complex and controversial. As with blood pressure, inconsistencies might reflect the timing of cholesterol measurements according to age, with older people possibly being less likely to receive lipid-lowering therapy (an example of the so-called \"generational effect\" ) and differences in the clinical onset of dementia.\nBrain cholesterol is involved in synapse development, synapse formation, dendrite differentiation, axonal elongation, and long-term potentiation.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> In the adult brain, the synthesis of primary cholesterol occurs in astrocytes and to a lesser extent in neurons.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Cholesterol is transported within the brain by local lipoproteins. Brain cholesterol metabolism is unrelated to metabolism in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system (CNS), and plasma cholesterol/lipoprotein compartments are strictly segregated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB).\nThe BBB is created by the tight junctions between the endothelial cells of brain microvascular tissue and the astrocyte foot processes surrounding capillary endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> BBB injury has been recognized as a contributory factor to the development and progression of cognitive impairment. Recently, multiple studies have reported that rats fed with high energy diets, specifically diet rich in saturated fats and cholesterol, exhibited increased BBB permeability along with cognitive dysfunction.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31,32]</u> Although normal aging increases BBB permeability,通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> oxidized LDL (oxLDL) promotes endothelial cell activation including increased the adhesion of monocyte to the vascular wall and the induction of the nuclear factor-κB pathway. A recent study showed that the activation of microvascular endothelial cells by LDL increased the secretion of the inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 and decreased the membrane localization of the tight junction protein ZO-1.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> LDL isolated from patients with hypercholesterolemia was more oxidized and inflammatory in endothelial cells than that isolated from healthy age-matched participants.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> In conjunction with these studies, another investigation demonstrated that anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering agents could reverse the high fat-induced BBB damage in rats.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> The reversal of BBB damage would, therefore, be expected to be accompanied by improvement in cognitive function. Inflammation and lipid oxidation might play an important role in the development of VaD.\nHDL-C might be involved in the removal of excess cholesterol from the brain mediated by ApoE and heparin sulfate proteoglycans in the subendothelial space of cerebral microvessels. In addition, HDL particles reverse the inhibitory effect of oxLDL particles on endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation and inhibit cytokine-induced expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> Paraoxonase 1 is an A-esterase with peroxidase-like activity present on the surface of HDL that decreases the peroxidation of LDL.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> These might be related to the protective effect of HDL against cognitive decline.\nAlthough several studies have reported no association between LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and magnetic resonance imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease,通用删除6(英):<u>[36,37]</u> one cohort study (n = 1919) revealed a significant relationship among increased HDL-C, decreased LDL-C, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) progression.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> Furthermore, in 1135 acute ischemic stroke patients, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or the use of lipid-lowering medication was associated with a decreased severity of WMH.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> Unfortunately, the authors were unable to assess the contribution of statin therapy to the observed association, which might have confounded their findings. Although a smaller cohort study (n = 112) showed no association between midlife total cholesterol and WMH two decades later, lipid-lowering therapy reduced the risk of WMH in later life.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> And low HDL levels increased the severity of white matter changes.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>\nSome evidences indicate that changes in brain cholesterol homeostasis are associated with the main pathological features of AD, especially amyloid beta (Aβ). Evidences also suggest that amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing might preferentially occur in the cholesterol-rich regions of membranes known as lipid rafts and that alterations in cholesterol levels could exert their effects by altering the distribution of APP-cleaving enzymes within the membrane. Functional cell biology studies further support the critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of Aβ precursor protein processing by β-secretase and γ-secretase, resulting in altered Aβ production. Decreased cholesterol levels have been shown to inhibit β-secretase activity while increasing the activity of α-secretase, the major proteolytic enzyme involved in APP metabolism.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>\nExperimental studies suggested that high cholesterol accelerated the production of Aβ, the putative pathologic species in AD, by shifting APP metabolism from α to β cleavage products.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> Animal studies showed that intervention with a high cholesterol diet led to memory deficits, increased oxidative stress, and doubled the concentration of amyloid in the hippocampus.通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> One study demonstrated that LDL from AD and AD with VaD patients was more damaging to endothelial barrier properties and increased release of inflammatory cytokines.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> However, HDL-C could prevent aggregation and polymerization of Aβ, thus slowing or even preventing the development of AD.通用删除6(英):<u>[39,40]</u> HDL-C was also reported to have anti-inflammatory properties.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>\nApoE is an important protein involved in cerebral cholesterol transport and influences aggregation and clearance of Aβ peptide. The ApoE ε4 allele in both homozygosis and heterozygosis increases the risk of developing AD.通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> The ε4 allele is associated with a higher risk of atherosclerosis and higher plasma levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> In addition, several other genes involved in cholesterol metabolism have been reported to be associated with AD including adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily A member 7,通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> clusterin, and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1).通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>\nIn addition, in vitro studies have shown that cholesterol acts as an antioxidant and therefore plays a protective role in dementia pathogenesis, possibly through intercepting prooxidants to create oxysterols, which are less toxic than free radicals.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> High cholesterol might have a protective effect by increasing gamma-glutamyltransferase. This enzyme plays an important role in amino acid uptake and transport and could reduce the neurotoxic effects of amino acids.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>\nStatins are a class of drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy- 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the cascade of cellular cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins thereby reduce the formation and entry of LDL-C into the circulation and upregulate LDL receptor activity, lowering LDL-C and triglycerides and increasing HDL-C. At present, firm conclusions regarding whether mid- or long-term statin use might influence cognitive decline and dementia remain elusive.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> Statins have neuroprotective effects through a variety of mechanisms. At the same time, the cognitive problems caused by statins should not be overlooked.\nTo date, most studies on statins and cognition are observational, and few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted. Two large, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs of statins, the Heart Protection Study (HPS),通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> and the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial, have been conducted.通用删除6(英):<u>[50,51]</u> In the HPS, simvastatin had no effect on cognitive decline, compared to the control.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> In the PROSPER trial, pravastatin treatment was not associated with a change in cognitive test results.通用删除6(英):<u>[50,51]</u> Several observational studies (conducted almost exclusively in adults aged >65 years) have considered the association between statin use at the baseline study visit and subsequent cognitive decline or incident dementia. Likewise, no association was observed between baseline statin (irrespective of their lipophilicity) use and incident dementia in the Three-City study, in which the follow-up period was 7 years.通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u> However, the Gingko Evaluation of Memory Study showed that time-updated statin use was associated with a reduced risk of dementia in participants without MCI at baseline.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> New statin use during follow-up was reported to be associated with a reduced risk of incident dementia.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> Trials of statins assessing outcomes relevant to cognition and dementia are rare. Several observational studies have observed an association between statin use and dementia. These have been systematically reviewed by several groups of authors. All reviews found significant heterogeneity between studies and reported the biases and confounding factors commonly associated with observational research, making conclusive results and implications for practice difficult to establish and disseminate.通用删除6(英):<u>[55,56,57]</u>\nMany previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of statins on endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u> However, statins might also confer neuroprotection by other mechanisms. For example, statins, particularly lipophilic statins, might cross the BBB and exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects within the CNS or modulate cholesterol metabolism in the brain.通用删除6(英):<u>[59,60]</u> Experiments in animal and cell models of AD have also suggested that statins modulate Aβ; however, few evidences currently support a similar effect in humans.通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> In addition, statins might modulate brain tau metabolism.通用删除6(英):<u>[61,62]</u>\nHowever, increasing concern exists that statins may be a causative factor of cognitive problems. Randomized trials, case reports, observational studies, and postmarketing surveillance have all reported data regarding cognitive impairment in people using statins.通用删除6(英):<u>[53,63,64]</u> Symptoms of confusion, forgetfulness, and memory loss have been reported within a few days after therapy, while other reports described symptom onset years after commencing statin use. Overall, the symptoms were not serious and reversed within a few weeks of ceasing statin therapy. Subsequently, at least three groups have systematically evaluated the situation and found no significant evidence showing that statins cause cognitive impairment.通用删除6(英):<u>[65,66,67]</u> The consistency of the independent findings of all recent reviews further shows that, to date, the evidence does not indicate an adverse effect of statins on cognitive function. Furthermore, these adverse effects seem to be rare and likely represent some yet-to-be-defined vulnerability in susceptible individuals.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u>\nThe associations between plasma lipids and cognition and the underlying mechanism, and the relationship between statins and cognitive function are complex and currently not fully understood. Given the aging population, there is an urgent need to identify treatments to prevent and treat cognitive impairment and dementia. Statins have important benefits in patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events that far outweigh the putative risks of cognitive dysfunction as an adverse effect. The true incidence of these adverse effects cannot be determined with currently available data. Nevertheless, because of the potentially serious nature of cognitive dysfunction, the widespread use of statins, and the high prevalence of cognitive impairment resulting from any causes (particularly aging and concomitant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases), patient reports regarding cognition should be taken seriously and be appropriately evaluated. Future research aimed at identifying the mechanisms that underlie plasma lipid and statin effects on cognition will not only provide important insights into the causes and interdependencies of cognitive impairment and dementia but also inspire novel strategies for treating and preventing these cognitive disorders.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by grants from the Science and Technology Pillar Program of Hebei Province, China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 14277787D)</u> and the Science and Technology Plan Program of Hebei Province, China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 16397795D)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

However, an important limitation of this study is that the multivariate model only included the baseline characteristics of patients, but not important intra-operative and post-operative risk factors associated with short-term mortality after cardiac surgery. It must be pointed out that if surgery is successful without severe post-operative complications, cardiac surgery can improve cardiac function, physical health status, and quality of life in most of the patients. It has been shown that established pre-operative risk factors including Logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation are not good predictors of post-operative mortality after cardiac surgery.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u>\nThe available evidence indicates that intra-operative major bleeding and blood transfusions, long cardiopulmonary bypass time, surgical re-exploration, immediate post-operative cardiovascular dysfunction, global ischemia, and metabolic dysfunction, acute kidney injury, pulmonary and gastrointestinal complications, and anemia beyond the 2nd post-operative day are the independent predictors of post-operative mortality of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Especially, post-operative anemia is common and sustained post-operative anemia is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events during the first 3 months after cardiac surgery; every 10 g/L decrease in post-operative hemoglobin level is associated with a 13% increase in adverse cardiovascular events and a 22% increase in all-cause mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> The multivariate logistic regression analysis is a commonly used statistical method to adjust patients’ baseline characteristics and control selection biases in a retrospective or prospective study, a limitation of this method is the assumption of a particular mathematical relation between intervention and measured outcome. To obtain the true inferences of multivariable regression analysis for an adjusted odds ratio of a measured outcome, all of the known risk factors affecting measured outcome must be taken into the model. If an important risk factor is missed, multivariate adjustment for an odds ratio of measured outcome can be biased and even a spurious association between the intervention and outcome of interest may be obtained. Thus, we argue that not taking the intra-operative and post-operative risk factors into the model would have tampered with the inferences of multivariate logistic regression analysis for risk factors of post-operative short-term mortality and their adjusted odds ratios in this study.\nFinally, the authors assessed the association of pre-operative atrial fibrillation with post-operative short-term mortality and showed that atrial fibrillation was not a risk factor for increased mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> However, they did not determine the influence of post-operative atrial fibrillation on short-term mortality after cardiac surgery. In fact, post-operative atrial fibrillation is a common, expensive, and potentially morbid complication following cardiac surgery and has been identified as an independent predictor of numerous adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery, including reoperation for bleeding, cardiac arrest, renal or respiratory failure, cerebral complications, need for permanent pacemaker placement, a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of stroke, and a 2-fold increase in all-cause 30-day and 6-month mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> We believe that the results of this study will be more informative, if this issue would have been included in the study design.\nAuthor’s Reply: Thank you for your professional comments on our study titled \"Prediction of short-term mortality after valve surgery: a single center’s perspective\" .通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> We have to admit that our risk factors were mostly concentrating on the baseline characteristics of our patients. Since our study included varies types of surgeries, such as mitral valve replacement (MVR), aortic valve replacement (AVR), double valve replacement (DVR), as well as concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), as a result, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time could not be a normal distribution. In addition, for data missing and other reasons, we were failed to analyze some intraoperative and postoperative risk factors, including postoperative cardiovascular dysfunction, global ischemia, and metabolic dysfunction, acute kidney injury, pulmonary and gastrointestinal complications, and some other risk factors. As you said, logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation and some other prediction models are not good predictors of postoperative mortality after cardiac surgery. We have tried to build our own model. However, eventually, we gave up due to the fact that we did not include some potential risk factors as you described in your letter, as well as we did not have a large enough sample basis. As for atrial fibrillation, we only counted the number of preoperative atrial fibrillation without leaving any evidence for postoperative electrocardiography (ECG). It made our lack of data for postoperative atrial fibrillation. Thank you again for your professional comments. We will improve our study design and put more intraoperative and postoperative risk factors in our further study.\nNone.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}
{"seq_id": "02883e05-41c1-4dca-8ada-eede94692e2c", "title": "", "text": "【0】According to the World Health Organization, a large number of people worldwide die from cardiovascular disorders each year than from any other cause.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3]</u> Each year, more than 3.0 million people experience acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI).通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Currently, myocardial reperfusion is the first option for treatment to reduce the area impacted by the acute MI and improve prognosis. However, the return of blood flow to the ischemic myocardium can also induce injury;通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> this is referred to as myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and associated with poorer functional recovery and adverse outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>\nConsiderable effort has gone toward finding ways to reduce the degree of injury from reperfusion;通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> however, few effective treatments exist, and further research is needed to seek new approaches.\nThe sigma-1 receptors (σ1Rs) are a relatively novel receptor group and are a ubiquitously expressed, unique binding site in the central nervous system and other peripheral tissues.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> These receptors are currently expected to be a potential target for drugs that treat neurodegenerative disorders, depression, idiopathic pain, and cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Recent studies have suggested that σ1R agonists have potent cardioprotective effects in mice. Intracerebroventricular infusion of the σ1R agonist PRE-084 for 1 month improved both mental and cardiac functioning in mice in which MI was induced.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (antidepressant drugs), such as sertraline and fluvoxamine, are potent agonists of σ1R. Fluvoxamine attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and restored contractility in transverse aortic constriction mice after being delivered for a month by stimulating σ1R; co-administration of the σ1R antagonist NE-100 eliminated the cardioprotective effect.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> However, these studies assessed σ1R over a relatively long time; whether PRE-084 is effective right after administration (i.e. in acute treatment directly after MI) is unknown.\nTo date, no studies have been performed regarding the effects of σ1R agonists on myocardial I/R injury. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanism of action and assess the effect of PRE-084 on myocardial I/R injury in rats.\nThe experiments were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines on the Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Wuhan University Ethics Committee on Animal Care.\nForty-two healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (220-250 g) were purchased from the animal center at Wuhan University, Hubei, China.\nThe rats were injected intraperitoneally with PRE-084 or saline (Santa Technology Co. Ltd. USA; dissolved in normal saline 1 mg/kg). One hour later, ischemia was induced by ligation at the left anterior descending coronary artery. Rats were subjected to 30 min of myocardial ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Successful reperfusion was defined as recovery of the elevated ST segment. Rats were randomized into three groups with computer (n = 14 for each group): 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the sham group, in which rats underwent identical surgical procedures but without occlusion of the coronary artery; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the I/R group, ischemia was induced in the rats for a period of 30 min; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the PRE-084 group (I/R + PRE-084 1 mg/kg).\nThe maximal velocity of left ventricular pressure development (LV ± dp/dt), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were measured through a polyethylene-50 tube that was advanced into the left ventricle through the right carotid artery and connected to a multichannel physiological monitoring system (Biopac MP150) 24 h after reperfusion.\nThe terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to analyze the degree of myocardial apoptosis according to the manufacturer’s protocol;通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> there were five rats in each group. To briefly summarize, the TUNEL reaction mixture was added to each sample. The slides were then incubated and washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by fixation in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4).通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> 3-3’ diaminobenzidine staining and hematoxylin and eosin restaining were performed. Stained slides were viewed under a light microscope. The apoptotic index was defined as the percentage of apoptotic cells out of the total number of myocardial cells.\nWestern blotting analyses were performed in five randomly selected rats from each group according to routine protocols. Briefly, the cardiac tissue from the left ventricle was homogenized in tris-buffered saline and then centrifuged at 12,000 bpm for 5 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicichoninic acid assay (Pierce Chemical, USA). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel, underwent electrophoresis, and were finally transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Merck Millipore, Burlington, Massachusetts, USA). The membranes were blocked with a 5% bovine serum albumin buffer at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. After washing three times with Tris buffered saline Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz, California, USA) for 30 min at 37°C.\nProtein signals were detected with a chemiluminescent system; expression levels of the proteins were compared to the control based on the relative intensities of the bands, which were determined using an image analyzer (AlphaEaseFC; Genetic Technologies, Inc.; Miami, Florida, USA).\nThe statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS Inc. USA). Data were described as means ± standard deviations (SD). The basis of homogeneity of variance was evaluated by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); multiple comparisons between the groups were performed using the Student-Newman-Keuls method, with a P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.\nTo assess the effect of PRE-084 on cardiac function, hemodynamic parameters such as LVEDP, LVSP, and LV ± dp/dt were measured. Compared with those in I/R group, LV ± dp/dt (+F = 92.4, −F = 36.2, P < 0.01) and LVSP (F = 62.6, P < 0.01) significantly increased in the PRE-084 group. LVEDP (P > 0.05) was not significantly changed between the two groups 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a, Figure 1d]</u>.\nThe TUNEL assay was used to assess the effect of PRE-084 on myocardial apoptosis during I/R injury. PRE-084 treatment significantly decreased the degree of myocardial apoptosis in the PRE-084 group (as measured by percentage of apoptotic cells) compared with that of the I/R group (F = 86.0, P < 0.01).\nThe expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) (Ser473) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS) (Ser1177) was assessed to explore the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effects of PRE-084. Phosphorylation levels of Akt and eNOS decreased significantly in I/R group compared with the sham group (P < 0.01). PRE-084 treatment led to significantly increased expression of p-Akt (F = 131.7, P < 0.01) and p-eNOS (F = 196.4, P < 0.01) in the PRE-084 group compared with those in the I/R group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3a and Figure 3b]</u>.\nCaspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax are the most important factors in the regulation of apoptosis. We assessed their expression levels to determine the potential mechanism. Compared with the sham group, Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly decreased (F = 37.2, P < 0.01) and Bax protein expression was significantly increased (F = 75.7, P < 0.01), with the Bcl-2/Bax ratio significantly reduced in the I/R group (P < 0.01); PRE-084 pretreatment restored most of the changes as illustrated in Figure 3c (P < 0.01).\nCompared with the sham group, the expression of cleaved caspase-3 significantly increased in the I/R group (P < 0.01) and significantly decreased in the PRE-084 group compared with the I/R group (F = 44.7, P < 0.01).\nOur study showed that PRE-084 protected the heart by reducing myocardial I/R injury in rats, as proved by preserved cardiac function and reduced myocardial apoptosis. Our data suggest that this occurs via changing the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and Bax) after activating the Akt-eNOS pathway.\nApoptosis is the major pathogenic mechanism of myocardial I/R injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> Since myocardial cells are nonregenerative, apoptosis may cause myocardial dysfunction, which surfaces during ischemia and then is aggravated after reperfusion.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> In the present study, the TUNEL assay clearly demonstrated that myocardial apoptosis was increased after IR injury, and that PRE-084 reduced its extent.\nThe mechanism through which IR injury increases myocardial cell apoptosis is not clear. The Bcl-2 gene family is recognized as containing the most important set of genes with respect to mediation of apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u> Bcl-2 is a protein that inhibits cell apoptosis, while Bax is a protein that promotes cell apoptosis. Accordingly, increases in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decrease the level of apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a major factor in the activity of the apoptotic pathway and is involved in the final step of the apoptotic process; it is also responsible for the cleavage of many other apoptotic proteins.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> The important role of caspases in the apoptotic process makes them a potential target for antiapoptotic treatments.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>\nIn the present study, PRE-084 upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 protein while downregulating the expression of Bax and caspase-3 proteins, thereby increasing the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax. These findings suggest that PRE-084 may decrease IR-induced apoptosis of myocardial cells by upregulating Bcl-2 expression and downregulating Bax and caspase-3 expression.\nWe further investigated the molecular mechanisms of the cardioprotective effects of PRE-084. Studies have shown that some signaling molecules have the function of upstream apoptotic regulation during myocardial reperfusion injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u> The PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway is the most important pathway for apoptotic regulation.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,24,25]</u> Activation of Akt restrains GSK-3β, which inhibits mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, a primary step for apoptotic and necrotic cell death.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u> On the other hand, activation of eNOS by Akt generates NO and activates mitochondrial KATP channels in a cGMP-dependent manner, leading to acute cardioprotection.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> It has been shown in a previous study that stimulating σ1R can activate Akt and eNOS in the heart, while ERK1/2 and PKC-α phosphorylations were not obviously changed.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> In the present study, levels of p-Akt and p-eNOS were significantly reduced after IR injury. PRE-084 treatment significantly increased the expression of p-Akt and p-eNOS, suggesting that PRE-084 protects the heart by activating the Akt-eNOS pathway.\nOur study has limitations. First, in our study, the animals were pretreated with PRE-084 before MI, which did not mimic the clinical setting, in which drugs would be administered after MI (in most cases, just before reperfusion). Second, previous studies have shown that PRE-084 can protect the heart by stimulating the σ1R in brain, which may also contribute to a certain extent to the cardioprotective effects shown in our study. Finally, σ1R interactions with ion channels, including Ca2+ channels, potassium channels, sodium channels, and chloride channels. These molecular mechanisms may also contribute to its myocardial protective effects.\nIn conclusion, these findings suggest that PRE-084 reduces apoptosis and improves cardiac function following reperfusion via activation of the Akt-eNOS signaling pathway. The results of this study reveal that PRE-084 may be a promising candidate for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury in ischemic heart diseases.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

{"seq_id": "d8639f3b-f0a0-40aa-bf90-7a1553da07e4", "title": "", "text": "【0】In recent years, drugs that have been reported to be associated with dermatitis include glucocorticoid, tacrolimus pimecrolimus,1 epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) such as erlotinib2 and cetuximab, vitamin B6,3 rarely the oral antidiabetic drug metformin, parabens, calcium channel blockers, and selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors. However, few reports have described drug-induced rosacea-like dermatitis.\nEGFRIs are the most widely used targeted drugs, and mainly used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer.2 A targeted drug has a specific target, thus avoiding common adverse effects of traditional chemotherapy drugs and reducing tissue and organ non-specific damage. However, EGFRIs may produce severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as rosacea dermatitis, consequently limiting their application. A Japanese study showed that patients with NSCLC treated with erlotinib developed a facial rash.4 However, rosacea-like dermatitis caused by icotinib hydrochloride has not been reported to date. Herein, we report such a case to call attention of clinician on the adverse events of this targeted drug.\nA 73-year-old man presented with a more than five months history of erythema and purulent pimples of the hair follicles accompanied by facial pruritus, which had become aggravated after taking icotinib hydrochloride again during the past one month. The erythema had first appeared on the middle portion of his face and mandible five months earlier; however, he had no subjective symptoms and was therefore not treated. The patient subsequently developed dense military purulent pimples of the hair follicles and blood scabs with mild pruritus overlying diffuse erythema without fever. One month before presentation, the rash became more severe after he began taking icotinib. Therefore, he was admitted to The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical University.\nThe patient had a six-year history of hypertension and a six-month history of NSCLC. He has been orally administered icotinib hydrochloride tablets since he was diagnosed as NSCLC. One month before presentation, he had begun taking the icotinib hydrochloride tablet of 125 mg three times daily as a new course of treatment for NSCLC. Clinical laboratory examination revealed a carcinoembryonic antigen concentration of 5.52 μg/L, soluble cytokeratin group concentration of 20.23 μg/L, and neuron-specific enolase concentration of 50.58 μg/L. Physical examination showed no remarkable superficial lymph node swelling and normal lung and heart sounds. Dermatological examination revealed symmetrical and well-defined erythema on the central aspect of the face and under the jaw . A mass of dense but isolated purulent pimples of the hair follicles overlying diffuse erythema was also seen. No scales were observed, but a higher skin temperature was present at the site of the rash. Dermatoscopic examination revealed telangiectasia, minimal bleeding, and numerous isolated purulent pimples . Examination for parasites and a bacterial smear of the contents of the pimples showed Demodex mites and a large number of inflammatory cells .\nThe patient was diagnosed as rosacea-like dermatitis. He was treated with 50 mg minocycline twice a day and topical compound polymyxin B cream twice a day. Two weeks later, the patient’s rash had subsided and his symptoms were relieved . The treatment regimen was changed to 50 mg minocycline once a day with continuation of the topical cream. The patient was followed up every two to four weeks. The erythema did not recur, and the targeted drug was not stopped.\nRosacea-like dermatitis, also known as acne-like rash, is caused by oral or topical use of drugs. This skin condition is not actually related to rosacea or acne, but is instead categorized as a drug eruption. The diagnosis of rosacea-like dermatitis depends on the patient’s medical history and clinical manifestations—combined with microscopic or histopathological examination.5 Previous reports of rosacea-like dermatitis induced by EGFRIs described enlarged follicles, proliferative inflammatory infiltration, and Demodex mites at the orifice of the hair follicles as shown by histopathological examinations.2 In the present case, the patient refused to undergo tissue biopsy and pathology, but a large number of Demodex mites and inflammatory cells were found by direct microscopic examination of the shaved purulent pimples. Combined with the patient’s history (ie, worsening of the facial rash one month after starting treatment with icotinib hydrochloride tablets) and the time relationship between the rash and drug use, the diagnosis of rosacea-like dermatitis was confirmed. The patient had taken an oral antihypertensive drug for more than six years before the onset of the rash; therefore, this drug was excluded from the relationship with the rash. Oral minocycline and topical antibiotic ointment were effective for the patient.\nAccording to the literature, rosacea-like dermatitis is mostly found in women. The clinical manifestations of rosacea-like dermatitis vary among different drugs. Glucocorticoid-related rosacea-like dermatitis mainly occurs on the middle aspect of the face and manifests as skin atrophy, erythema, telangiectasia, pustular papules, light sensitivity, and a high incidence of secondary infection. The clinical manifestations of local immuno-suppressants are similar to those of local glucocorticoids, but immunosuppressants do not cause skin atrophy. Rosacea-like dermatitis induced by vitamin B6 is relatively rare and is mainly characterized by erythematous papules rather than telangiectasia. In one reported case, the rash appeared to be due to the maximum amount of daily intake of vitamin B6 than acceptable daily intake, and long-term use induced rosacea-like dermatitis.6 The early responses of EGFRIs after two to three weeks of drug use are characterized by diffuse erythema and papules, followed by pustules, desquamation, blood scabbing, pruritus, sensitive skin, or pustular papules overlying edematous erythema.2,7 The late responses after continued treatment for a few weeks or months include telangiectasia, dry chapped skin, hair changes, hyperpigmentation, nail damage such as paronychia, periodontal abscesses, and pyogenic granuloma, potentially adversely affecting the patient’s quality of daily life.8 In the present case, only the patient’s face was affected. Symmetrical edematous erythema appeared after he had taken icotinib hydrochloride tablets for one month, and follicular pyogenic papules and blood scabs subsequently appeared overlying the erythema; however, no apparent desquamation was noted. EGFRs are mainly expressed in epidermal cells, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles, and they affect epidermal growth factor, epidermal growth and proliferation, and hair growth, potentially resulting in skin complications. In addition, patients usually develop secondary skin infections due to destruction of the skin barrier and the damage to the antiseptic mechanism.\nRosacea-like dermatitis should be differentiated from rosacea and perioral dermatitis.5 Rosacea-like dermatitis, also known as acne rosacea, usually occurs on the middle of the face, mainly on the tip and ala of the nose. The main manifestations are erythema and telangiectasia. In severe cases, enlarged nodules develop on the dorsal aspect of the nose, the surface of which is uneven. The condition can become aggravated by eating spicy foods or drinking hot liquids, being exposed to an elevated ambient temperature, and experiencing emotional excitement. Perioral dermatitis is the most frequently diagnosed dermatitis in women (approximately 90% of cases of dermatitis) and is characterized by 1–2 mm papules and papulovesicles scattered around the mouth. These may be accompanied by mild scales, and they gradually improve and subside after exposure factors are removed or avoided.\nRosacea-like dermatitis gradually subsides after discontinuation of the causative drug. However, such a drug is indispensable for the treatment of another disease. As described in the present case, the drug is icotinib hydrochloride, a targeted drug for NSCLC. Withdrawal of it will lead to the proliferation of cancer cells; therefore, treatment of the rash is particularly important instead of discontinuation of the causative drug. Generally, a combination of one or two types of antibiotics (eg, tetracycline, metronidazole, clindamycin, doxycycline) can produce satisfactory curative effects. According to the treatment guidelines established in recent years, a fixed combination of topical corticosteroids and antibiotics (betamethasone, gentamicin) combined with cold compresses (twice a day for 10 days) confers significant benefits over the skin-related adverse effects of EGFRIs.删除4：<u>7,9</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

However, traditional sclerotherapy via anoscope may cause iatrogenic risk and complications due to misplaced injections.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The flexible endoscopic sclerotherapy for internal hemorrhoids using a short needle without cap assistant was first reported in 1991 in the United States.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The flexible endoscopic injection using a short needle with cap assistant was reported in 2014 in Japan.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Cap-assisted endoscopic sclerotherapy (CAES) primarily using a long needle was reported in 2015通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> as an emerging flexible endoscopic therapy, and has been widely used for internal hemorrhoids and some prolapse in China. A panel of experts aimed to develop expert recommendations for CAES and derived guidelines on the key issues in hemorrhoidal disease, including rationale, new positioning methods for anus, indications, contraindications, techniques, post-procedure management, and core outcome set for evaluation 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nMethods and results for expert recommendations development: The modified three-round Delphi procedure was used for developing expert recommendations. Each invited expert did not know who else were invited before the third round. Each statement was accepted when ≥80% of the experts agreed. All statements were presented to 33 of 33 (100%) members on May 28, 2021, at the China Gut Conference, Nanjing, China. The full version of the Expert Recommendation is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary File 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A818]</u>.\nRationale: The concept and value of CAES for hemorrhoidal disease mainly include: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Endoscope with cap and air delivery improves the endoscopic exposure for diagnosis and therapy, which should contribute to avoid iatrogenic injury due to ectopic injection; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> CAES is an effective therapy for internal hemorrhoids bleeding, and an option for rectal mucosal prolapse; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Anorectal lesions differentiation, colon screening, and endoscopic therapy can be performed during the CAES procedure for better cost-efficacy.\nAnus positioning methods: The residual fluid or injected water within the anus under endoscopy is the sign for determining the left anus under the left lateral decubitus position. Along the clockwise direction, left anus, posterior anus, right anus, and anterior anus (LPRA) is recommended to replace the typical lithotomy position for the precise direction description on the anal lesions and endoscopic therapy.\nBased on the standard left lateral decubitus position for colonoscopy, the fluid accumulation is located on the left side of the anal canal 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. After confirming the position of the left side of the anus by the endoscopic injected water or the residual fluid, along the clockwise direction, the LPRA positioning method is practical, reliable, and a simple technique for physicians and patients to have direct and quick understanding. This LPRA four-direction description can be further divided into eight directions: left, left-posterior, posterior, right, right-posterior, anterior, right-anterior, and left-anterior. The LPRA positioning method for anal lesions and targeting therapy can improve the clinical workflow, scientific communications, and physician-patient communications 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>.\nIndication 1: CAES for internal hemorrhoids. Patients with symptomatic Grade I or II internal hemorrhoids are considered for CAES when lifestyle intervention and conservative management are ineffective. CAES can be considered for patients with Grade III internal hemorrhoids unsuitable for surgery or those refusing surgery. Several studies have shown that flexible endoscopic sclerotherapy is effective minimally invasive therapy for Grades I-II internal hemorrhoids, with a relatively low occurrence of post-procedural pain and bleeding.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u> It has also been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for some Grade III hemorrhoids.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u>\nIndication 2: CAES for internal mucosal prolapse. CAES is a therapeutic option for symptomatic small rectal mucosal prolapse. The most common symptoms of rectal mucosal prolapse are the protrusion itself, such as anal pendant expansion, obstruction feelings, and tenesmus. CAES with a long needle was reported as an effective therapy for small rectal mucosal prolapse,通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> however, more solid evidence is necessary.\nContraindications: The contraindications of CAES for hemorrhoids at least include patients with perianal abscess, stricture, fistula, anal malignancies, and pregnancy. CAES with conventional-dose injection is not recommended for patients with active proctitis, radiation enteritis, immune-related ulcer, or unexplained anal ulcer.\nCAES can be considered as an option for bleeding hemorrhoids during an emergency in patients with cerebrovascular accidents, immunodeficiency, or hyperco-agulability disorders after balancing potential risks and possible benefits from the interventional procedure. CAES is not recommended to treat thrombosed and strangulated hemorrhoids, Grade IV internal hemorrhoids, or external hemorrhoids. Psychiatric consultation should be recommended when a patient with hemorrhoid-like complaints has suspicious mental stability, such as hypochondriasis, hysterical reactions, and somatization of anal symptoms.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>\nBowel preparation for CAES: Bowel preparation is recommended for meeting the criteria of the required colonoscopic diagnosis and therapy. Anesthesia assistance during CAES is helpful in improving physician-patient satisfaction.\nCap and air insufflation for CAES: Both conventional short-straight cap on the endoscope and the proper air insufflation are the key conditions for effective exposure and fluent therapy during the CAES procedure for the hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C]</u>. A conventional short-straight cap is recommended for maximizing visibility of the targeting field for diagnosis and injection 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1D-F]</u>. The colonoscope with the cap is helpful for preventing air leaking from the anus during injection of air for improving endoscopic exposure.\nChoosing the needles and related consideration: The long or short injection needles should be considered according to the condition of hemorrhoidal disease.\nThe different techniques using long and short needles are shown in Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/ CM9/A819. A long injection needle is defined as the length ≥10 mm. For patients only with bleeding hemorrhoids, both long and short needles can be selected for injection.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,7]</u> The long needle is recommended for the hemorrhoids combined with prolapse. The sclerosing agent is injected into the submucosal layer for about 5 s with 0.5 to 2.0 mL lauromacrogol per site.\nPositioning and injection: The LPRA anus positioning method is helpful for the endoscopist to locate the injected and non-injected sites, thus avoiding the use of a tracer agent. The six o’clock position under endoscopic view is the recommended site for injection.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> The sclerosing agents for treating internal hemorrhoids in China mainly include lauromacrogol, polidocanol, and traditional Chinese medicine (e.g. Xiaozhiling and Shaobei). Lauromacrogol is recommended to be injected with original fluid.\nPost-CAES management 1: Patients post-CAES should remain in a supine position for at least 2 h to prevent prolapse and monitor potential short-term complications. Given the scarce literature, the supine position in bed for at least 2 h post-procedure is helpful for monitoring and managing the potential CAES-related complications in clinical practice.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Diets that might cause defecation during 6 to 12 h post-CAES should be avoided for patients.\nPost-CAES management 2: Patients with chronic constipation or diarrhea should be treated with etiological treatment after CAES for preventing the recurrence of hemorrhoids. Both chronic constipation and diarrhea should be treated post-CAES.\nPost-CAES management 3: Both antibiotics and hemostatics are not regularly required during and after the CAES procedure. No evidence supports the necessity of conventional use of antibiotics during or post-CAES. CAES has advantages in preventing iatrogenic risk from misplaced injections, which largely reduces the potential post-operative infections due to mucosal ulceration or necrosis, prostatic abscess, and others.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nPost-CAES management 4: CAES-associated complications mainly include difficulty in passing gas, bleeding, infection, ulcer, and chronic anal pain. The CAES procedure-associated complications were mainly reported from physicians who were in the early stage of CAES training.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Enema is the way to solve the difficulty in passing gas and defecation, and lower intestinal obstruction.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\nCore outcome set for evaluation: The patient self-report based on both hemorrhoid-specific symptoms (pain, prolapse, blood loss, itching, and soiling) and life quality can be applied for efficacy evaluation of CAES in clinical practice and research. The patient-reported outcome measure based on both hemorrhoid-specific symptoms and patient quality of life has been widely applied to clinical practice and research of hemorrhoids. The primary outcome measurements, which included the core outcome, were sets of \"pain\" , \"prolapse\" , \"blood loss\" , \"itching\" , and \"soiling\" . Other additional domains, such as complications, recurrence, patient satisfaction, and others, were common sets of secondary outcomes.\nTo conclude, this expert opinion on the new anus positioning methods and the updated protocols of CAES will guide the research and practice of hemorrhoidal disease management.\nFei-Hu Bai, Haikou; Shi-Yao Chen, Shanghai; Ye Chen, Shenzhen; Bo-Ta Cui, Nanjing; Ming-Ming Deng, Luzhou; Zhi-Ning Fan, Nanjing; Bai-Sui Feng, Zhengzhou; Xing-Xiang He, Guangzhou; Yun-Lian Hu, Wuhan; Xiao-Meng Jiang, Nanjing; Yan Jin, Wuxi; Jing-Nan Li, Beijing; Rong Lin, Wuhan; Tian-Yu Liu, Suining; Zhan-Guo Nie, Urumqi; Ying Song, Xi’an; Yang Sun, Kunming; Rong Wan, Shanghai; Fang-Yu Wang, Nanjing; Xin Wang, Xi’an; Wei Wei, Beijing; Yan-Ling Wei, Chongqing; Quan Wen, Nanjing; Kai-Chun Wu, Xi’an; Fang Xiao, Wuhan; Shi-Ming Yang, Chongqing; Ping Yao, Urumqi; Yu Yuan, Guangzhou; Hui-Hong Zhai, Beijing; Fa-Ming Zhang, Nanjing; Guo-Xin Zhang, Nanjing; Zhen-Yu Zhang, Nanjing; Yong-Jian Zhou, Guangzhou.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Experimental and clinical studies suggest that systemic administration of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) protein or overexpression of IGF-1 in the heart exerts a favorable effect on cardiovascular function. This study aimed to investigate a chronic stage after myocardial infarction (MI) and the potential therapeutic effects of delivering a human IGF-1 gene by tissue-engineered bioartificial muscles (BAMs) following coronary artery ligation in Sprague-Dawley rats.Methods Ligation of the left coronary artery or sham operation was performed. Primary skeletal myoblasts were retrovirally transduced to synthesize and secrete recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1), and green fluorescent protein (GFP), and tissue-engineered into implantable BAMs. The rats that underwent ligation were randomly assigned to 2 groups: MI-IGF group (n=6) and MI-GFP group (n=6). The MI-IGF group received rhIGF-secreting BAM (IGF-BAMs) transplantation, and the MI-GFP group received GFP-secreting BAM (GFP-BAMs) transplantation. Another group of rats served as the sham operation group, which was also randomly assigned to 2 subgroups: S-IGF group (n=6)and S-GFP group (n=6). The S-IGF group underwent IGF-1-BAM transplantation, and S-GFP group underwent GFP-BAM transplantation. IGF-1-BAMs and GFP-BAMs were implanted subcutaneously into syngeneic rats after two weeks of operation was performed. Four weeks after the treatment, hemodynamics was performed. IGF-1 was measured by radioimmunoassay, and then the rats were sacrificed and ventricular samples were subjected to immunohistochemistry. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to examine the mRNA expression of bax and Bcl-2. TNF-α and caspase 3 expression in myocardium was examined by Western blotting.Results Primary rat myoblasts were retrovirally transduced to secrete rhlGF-1 and tissue-engineered into implantable BAMs containing parallel arrays of postmitotic myofibers. In vitro, they secreted consistent levels of hIGF (0.4-1.2 μg·BAM-1·d-1). When implanted into syngeneic rat, IGF-BAMs secreted and delivered rhIGF. Four weeks after therapy,the hemodynamics was improved significantly in MI rats treated with IGF-BAMs compared with those treated with GFP-BAMs. The levels of serum IGF-1 were increased significantly in both MI and sham rats treated with IGF-BAM. The mRNA expression of bax was lower and Bcl-2 expression was higher in MI-IGF group than MI-GFP group (P ＜0.05).Western blotting assay showed TNF-α and caspase 3 expression was lower in MI-IGF group than MI-GFP group after therapy.Conclusions rhIGF-1 significantly improves left ventricular function and suppresses cardiomyocyte apoptosis in rats with chronic heart failure. Genetically modified tissue- engineered BAMs provide a method delivering recombinant protein for the treatment of heart failure。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

In airway remodeling during chronic asthma, it is not well understood how BSMCs exert their inflammatory functions. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway is an important signaling pathway in chronic asthma, but its influence on secretion by BSMCs has not been well-studied. We investigated the impact of ERK1/2 signaling pathway on secretion by BSMCs in a rat model of chronic asthma in this study.Methods To create a rat model of chronic asthma, Wistar rats underwent ovalbumim (OVA) injection and eight weeks of inhalation. BSMCs were isolated and cultured in vitro. Epidermal growth factor, PD98059 and ERK1/2 antisense oligonucleotide were used to explore the role of ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The expression of P-ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2) in BSMCs was analyzed by Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Secretion of BSMCs was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results Phospho-ERK1/2 expression was increased in BSMCs of chronic asthmatic rats compared with the controls. PD98059 inhibited expression of phospho-ERK1/2 protein, while treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide inhibited the expression of P-ERK1/2 mRNA and protein. BSMCs obtained from the chronic asthma group secreted significantly greater quantities of growth factors (transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)), cytokines (regulated upon activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) and eotaxin), and extracellular matrix (fibronectin and collagen l) compared with normal controls. Epidermal growth factor stimulated secretion in both groups, but the response of the chronic asthma group was more intense. Both PD98059 and antisense oligonucleotide suppressed secretion by BSMCs in chronic ashmatic rats. Antisense oligonucleotide reduced the level of RANTES nearly to that of normal controls, while PD98059 could not. Conclusion These results suggest that ERK1/2 signaling pathway may play an important role in the augmented secretion of BSMCs in chronic asthmatic rats, and ERK1/2 antisense oligonucleotide effectively inhibits the process。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Atypical otogenic symptoms and lack of awareness are responsible for misdiagnosis. Here, we presented a case of zygomatic root abscess resulting from an acute attack of masked mastoiditis.\nA 10-year-old girl had a history of tenderness of the right temporal area for 6 months. Physical examination revealed only swelling of the right temporal fossa. No otogenic syndrome was found. Since antibiotic therapy alone was ineffective, the girl was admitted to the tumor hospital and then Peking University Dental Hospital. The pathological finding of fine-needle aspiration biopsy was inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) showed thickened soft tissue around the temporal area 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that there was soft-tissue mass in her right zygomatic root area. The swelling and erythematous area in the zygomatic root area worsened. A subepidermal retroauricular abscess formed, and she underwent abscess drainage 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1d]</u>. She was then transferred to our department.

CT scan was rechecked and showed soft tissue in the right mastoid and tympanic cavity, with an irregular osteolytic area involving tympanic cavity, zygomatic root, and zygomatico temporal junction 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b]</u>. Finally, we made a diagnosis of zygomatic root abscess resulting from an acute attack of masked mastoiditis. The girl underwent mastoidectomy and intravenous antibiotic therapy.

Neck sinus abscess has also been reported.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Since the zygomatic root is in a relatively high position and usually drains well, there is rare chance for an abscess to develop. However, when purulent secretion extends to the highly pneumatized root of the zygomatic process, the pneumatized bone can be eroded and purulent secretion can accumulate within the temporalis fossa once there is penetration through the periosteum. Purulent secretion can even track from the zygomatic root into the cheek to form mumps of the cheek, which usually misleads doctors to make an incorrect diagnosis.\nImproper use of antibiotics can mask the signs of otitis media and results in masked mastoiditis, which can also be responsible for the misdiagnosis of zygomatic root abscess. Cultures can guide proper selection of antibiotics. Mastoidectomy is necessary once conservative treatments are found to be ineffective. During the operation, purulent secretion and eroded bone should be removed, clearing the involved air cells of the zygomatic root as well as the mastoid process.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Very pre-term infants have several unique features related to their ongoing maturation, and associated findings on cUS should be considered for accurate and early diagnosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u> The purpose of this study was to summarize the cUS characteristics of the brains of very premature infants of different gestational ages (GAs) ≤ 29 weeks to provide an understanding of the diagnosis of abnormal brain conditions.\nThe ethical approval from the Institutional Ethics Examining Committee of Human Research 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. sk2019-14)</u> was obtained before patient recruitment. All participants signed an informed written consent and a full explanation was given regarding the coblation annulaplasty and its schematic procedures, and benefits and potential complications. A total of 137 very pre-term infants born at a GAs ≤29 weeks were observed. The infants had a median GA of 27+2 weeks and a minimum age of 22+5 weeks. Their average birth weight was 1002 ± 21 g, and weights ranged from 500 to 1650 g.\nThe youngest case was a female infant born at a GA of 22+5 weeks and weighing 850 g. The infant’s cerebral longitudinal fissure and lateral fissure showed a single linear echo and a wide gap, and her brain surface was smooth with few sulci. Her periventricular echodensities (PVE) were grade II. At 3 weeks after birth, the cingulate sulcus began to appear with a short linear echo in the sagittal section. The cerebral longitudinal fissure exhibited few folds, and the lateral fissure showed short branches. The cerebral sulci significantly increased at 8 weeks after birth. Numerous sulci appeared to the side of the longitudinal fissure and on the surface of the parenchyma. The cingulate sulcus lengthened and became distinct, and gaps in the lateral fissure narrowed and branched. At 11 weeks after birth, the PVE turned to normal, the cerebral sulci developed with many branches, and the hippocampal gyrus had a well-defined boundary.\nIn infants born at GA of 23 to 24 weeks, the cerebral longitudinal fissure, lateral fissure, hippocampal gyrus, and calcarine sulcus showed single linear echoes with few folds or branches. The lateral fissure had wide gaps. The cerebral parenchyma was smooth without small sulci. In infants born at a GA of 26 weeks, the cingulate sulcus began to take shape and showed short dashed or single linear echoes without obvious branches. At similar GAs, infants with heavier birth weights exhibited clearer cingulate sulci and better-developed brains compared with those born with lower weights. In infants born at GAs of 27 to 28 weeks, the lateral fissure exhibited wide gaps with short branches. Deep inside the cerebral parenchyma, a few shallow sulci appeared perpendicular to the cerebral longitudinal fissure. No obvious cerebral sulcus structures were present in the shallow layer of the cerebral parenchyma. The cingulate gyrus was well developed with few branches in the sulcus. In infants born at a GA of 28 weeks, the parieto-occipital sulcus exhibited short linear echoes in the shallow layer of the parenchyma. In infants born at a GA of 29 weeks, the cingulate sulcus exhibited multiple curved branches that extended into the cerebral parenchyma. The boundary of the cingulate gyrus was essentially formed, and gaps between the lateral fissures narrowed and branched. Numerous cerebral sulci with short line-like echoes appeared next to the longitudinal fissure and the shallow layer of the cerebral parenchyma. The brain development of infants born at a GA of 29 weeks was more mature than that of pre-term infants born at a GA <28 weeks.\nThe cUS images of the coronal and axial sections of the cerebellum were obtained by scanning the mastoid fontanelle. The coronal section of the cerebellum at the mastoid fontanelle showed the pontine, parts of the cerebellar vermis, the cerebellar hemispheres (including the cortex and medulla), and the cerebellar cistern. The axial section of the cerebellum showed the cerebellar vermis, cerebellar hemisphere, and fourth ventricle. Within the cerebellar hemispheres, the boundary between the cortex and medulla was clear, and numerous shallow sulci were visible in the cortex. Furthermore, the cerebellar vermis was well developed with clear surface textures and plentiful folds and showed caterpillar-like changes in full time infants 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nIn infants born at GA of 25 to 28 weeks, the cerebral parenchyma in the cerebellar hemisphere was smooth. However, the boundary between the cortex and medulla was unclear. Few sulci were present in the cortex, and the vermis had a visible but loose texture.\nIn infants born at a GA of 29 weeks, the cerebellar hemisphere exhibited short, line-like shallow sulci, and the vermis was longer than that in infants born before a GA of 28 weeks.\nThe transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD), anteroposterior cerebellar diameter (APCD), and length of the cerebellar vermis (CVL) of the infants were measured通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>, and the cerebellar measurements of 38 infants born at different GAs were averaged. The cerebellar measurements of very pre-term infants born at GAs of 25 to 29 weeks, particularly APCD and TCD, gradually increased over time. Analysis of variance revealed that changes in TCD, APCD, and CVL length between the different GA groups were statistically significant (F = 45.57, P < 0.001; F= 33.51, P < 0.001; and F= 11.12, P < 0.001, respectively).\nPearson correlation analyses showed that ACD was significantly correlated with body weight and GA (r = 0.71, P < 0.001; r = 0.86, P < 0.001, respectively), APCD was significantly correlated with body weight and GA (r = 0.66, P < 0.001; r = 0.75, P < 0.001, respectively), and CVL was significantly correlated with body weight and GA (r = 0.71, P < 0.001; r = 0.75, P < 0.001, respectively).\nIn conclusion, cerebral and cerebellar structures develop in very pre-term infants (GA ≤29 weeks), and cerebellar measurements changed as the GA increased. The brain development of infants born at a GA of 29 weeks was significantly more mature than that of pre-term infants born at a GA <28 weeks.

The disease is caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which can be highly pathogenic in humans. Individuals infected with MERS-CoV may experience none, mild or severe respiratory illnesses or even death. As of 30 May 2020, a total of 27 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, Northeast Asia, and North America have reported 2562 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases and 881 associated deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The vast majority of MERS cases were reported by the Saudi Arabia, followed by Republic of Korea 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Frequent travelers and worshippers from and to the Middle East have raised the concern about a global pandemic, given the lack of effective treatment and vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In February 2018, WHO formally incorporated MERS into the Research and Development Blueprint (the R&D Blueprint) to promote research in this area 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\nCurrent epidemiological studies suggest that human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is inefficient, and the primary infection mode is via direct/indirect contact with dromedary camels, although other mammals may also serve as the reservoir 通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6,7,8,9,10]</u>. On the other hand, human clusters of MERS have been continuously observed in healthcare and household settings, especially among people with chronic conditions or compromised immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u>. Several studies explored risk factors for the transmission of MERS-CoV at the individual level in specific countries and found that infection risk was mainly driven by recent exposure to dromedary or its raw products, chronic conditions, or close contact with other MERS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[11,13,14,15,16]</u>. However, very few studies have systematically analyzed spatial diffusion of the virus at the population level and associated risk factors. In addition, while it has been shown that chronic condition and male sex are highly predictive of fatal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>, no study has examined potential interactions among key predictors for death, e.g. demographic characteristics and animal contact. Some of these predictors are correlated, e.g. males tend to have much more frequent contact with dromedary. Consequently, it is necessary to condition on one predictor when evaluating the effect of another.\nIn the midst of the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is crucial to understand the epidemiological characteristics and evolutionary history for MERS-CoV as the two coronaviruses are genetically related. The possibility of recombination between the two viruses if co-infection of the same host occurs cannot be totally ruled out, as their host species do overlap, e.g. humans and bats 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Thus far, phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses focusing on MERS-CoV have been either outdated or restricted to small data sets 通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,19,20,21]</u>. In addition, some evolutionary characteristics of MERS-CoV such as which genes are subject to positive selection, need to be closely monitored.\nBy assembling MERS surveillance and contact tracing data up to June of 2020 from public health agencies and peer-reviewed literature, we summarized the epidemiological features and spatiotemporal spread of MERS around the globe. We investigated risk factors for fatality and how their effects could be modified by each other. In addition, we assessed the roles of a variety of environmental, socioeconomic, and biological factors in the spatial diffusion of MERS-CoV. Using publicly available MERS-CoV full-genome sequences, we further assessed the evolution and migration history of the virus. Piecing these results together, we aim to provide an up-to-date picture about both population and molecular epidemiology of this pathogen.\nWe assembled three datasets: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> a list of individual human cases worldwide with demographic, exposure and clinical information, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> eco-geographic and socioeconomic characteristics (referred to as socioenvironmental variables hereinafter) at the appropriate administrative level in the Middle East (county for Saudi Arabia and province for the other countries), and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> full-genome sequences of MERS-CoV worldwide.\nData on confirmed MERS cases were collected from official reports of WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, and the health departments of affected countries, which were cross-validated with and supplemented by data from websites and literatures. Search medical subject headings (MeSH) terms used were \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus/MERS-CoV/HCoV-EMC\" or \"Middle East respiratory syndrome/Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome/MERS\" .\nAll the cases had been confirmed following a standard WHO technical guidance 删除6：<u></u>. A valid record of MERS case must include the basic demographic information (gender, age, reporting country, city of residence, being healthcare worker or not, baseline chronic conditions), dates of critical events (such as symptom onset, first hospitalization, laboratory confirmation), and exposure information (whether exposed to animal or its raw production, or exposed to confirmed MERS patients). Cases without any individual information, duplicated records and no-confirmed cases were removed. Each confirmed case was geo-referenced and mapped according to the finest address available using GIS technologies. Thematic maps of cumulative numbers of confirmed MERS cases and clusters were created using ArcGIS 10.5 (Esri Inc, Redlands, CA, USA).\nThe following socioenvironmental variables potentially related to the transmission of MERS were collected: population density, camel density, monthly meteorological data, elevation, land cover, economic development level, transportation, locations of hospitals. Full-genome sequences (> 30 000 bp) of MERS-CoV up to June of 2020, together with isolation year, host type and location, were retrieved from GenBank. Protein and the coding sequences (CDS) sequences of these MERS-CoV sequences were derived. All the data sources 通用删除1(英):<u></u> involved in this study were introduced in detail in the 通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Additional Appendix.</u>\nMERS-affected countries were grouped into four categories of transmission type: (i) zoonotic transmission plus human-to-human transmission, (ii) zoonotic transmission without human-to-human transmission, (iii) imported infection plus human-to-human transmission, and (iv) imported infection without human-to-human transmission 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. Existence of zoonotic transmission was determined by reported endemic circulation with frequent zoonotic introduction. A case cluster is defined as a group of two or more epidemiologically linked cases, where epidemiological link refers to close contact as indicated by the source database or literature. For example, the WHO database provides the ID number of the source case for some cases. By this definition, all cases in the outbreak in Republic of Korea can be traced to the same imported case and are therefore considered a single case cluster 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Demographic characteristics were compared between country categories and between case types using the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and the χ2 test for categorical variables.\nLogistic regression was performed to explore risk factors associated with the survival outcome of MERS cases. All MERS cases with reliable survival outcome and contact information (before symptom onset) were included in the analysis. The following potential risk factors were included in the analysis: age group (≥ 65 years old vs < 65 years old), sex (male vs female), region (Middle East vs other), occupation (healthcare worker vs other), underlying chronic conditions including diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic respiratory and circulatory diseases and compromised immune systems (yes, no, unknown), animal contact (yes, no, unknown), time from disease onset to confirmation (OTC, > 5 days vs ≤ 5 days), and reporting year 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012-2014, 2015-2016, 2017-2020)</u>. Among variables with missing values, OTC were imputed using R package \"mice\" . But missing values of underlying condition and animal contact were treated into a category of unknown, for imputation efficiency is not high for variables with a missing rate over 30%, Backward elimination was used to a parsimonious model (threshold P-value = 0.05). Two-way interactions among age group, sex and animal contact were considered based on the amount of data per category of each factor.\nWe limited the spatiotemporal diffusion analysis to the Middle East Region, the main endemic region of MERS. Opportunistic long-distance exportations of MERS cases, e.g. to Europe and Republic of Korea, were not considered. The spatial unit used in this study is the second-level administrative unit, e.g. province, for most countries. Provinces of Saudi Arabia are much larger than those of neighboring countries. To make spatial units comparable between countries, we use the third-level administrative area (county) as the spatial unit for Saudi Arabia. Finally, a total of 283 administrative units were included in the spatiotemporal diffusion analysis.\nWe obtained 34 socioenvironmental variables from various data sources 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. Camel density was available only at the national level in many countries. Considering the role of camel as a MERS-CoV reservoir, we imputed missing values of camel density using the R package \"mice\" . To account for uncertainties in these missing values, we generated 100 imputed sets of camel density and averaged all analyses related to camel density over these imputation sets. To reduce collinearity among these variables, we screened pairwise correlations. If two variables have an absolute Pearson correlation higher than 0.65, the one with a higher average correlation with all other variables was excluded.\nA Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess which socioenvironmental variables were associated with the reporting time (since September 2012) of the first MERS case in each space unit. A spatial trend contour plot was developed to visualize the spatial diffusion of the disease. The time between adjacent contours was fixed at 200 days, and a wider gap between adjacent contours indicates a faster spatial diffusion. All descriptive and diffusion analyses were performed using the R software version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A two-sided P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe whole-genome sequences were analyzed using toolkits provided by the Nextstrain framework 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.407 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>, and the alignment was trimmed to a reference genome (Gen-Bank accession ID: NC_019843.3). A phylogenetic tree was built using a maximum likelihood approach implemented in IQ-Tree v1.6.10 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. For the phylogeographic analysis, TreeTime was used to infer the divergence time, discrete traits of the ancestral nodes (location and host), and geographic transmission history across the tree 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. To detect sites under positive selection among CDS of protein genes, for each gene, the original open reading frame (ORF) sequences were first aligned using MAFFT and CDS were aligned using PAL2NAL v14 under the guidance for protein alignment 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. CodeML in PAML v4.9 as part of the ETE 3 package (v 3.1.1) was used to detect positive selection sites by branch-site test 通用删除6(英):<u>[27,28]</u>. To balance the sample size of each host species, human and camel sequences were randomly down-sampled to five sequences per host species. After smoothing mortality rate and incidence rate over space and time, we matched these smoothed rates with tree tips (MERS-CoV sequences) by specimen collection year and location to assess potential association of phylogeny with mortality and incidence rates.\nFrom September 2012 to June 2020, a total of 2562 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases were reported. After excluding 112 cases with incomplete data, 2450 confirmed MERS cases, together with 150 derived case clusters, were included in subsequent analyses . The median age was 53 years old (IQR: 38-65), and 69.4% of cases were male. Healthcare workers accounted for 13.7% (335/2450) of the total patients. The median time from disease onset to diagnosis was 5 days (IQR: 3-8). Death occurred in 802 patients, leading to a case fatality rate (CRF) of 32.7% (95% CI: 30.9-34.6%). Among the 1453 patients with known exposure history, 356 (24.0%) reported animal contact. Zoonotic infections (i.e. countries in transmission categories i and ii) only occurred in the Middle East, although cases with animal contact had also been imported into Europe and Southeast Asia . Among countries with locally infected patients, the proportion of cases with animal contact exceeded 50% in Qatar, followed by 15-29% in Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia .\nBaseline demographic and clinical characteristics of confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome cases reported between September 2012 and June 2020\n删除重复语句：<u>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome cases reported between September 2012 and June 2020</u>\nIQR, interquartile range; CFR, case fatality rate\nSaudi Arabia, Republic of Korea and UAE together reported the vast majority of the cases and case clusters 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. Patients from the three countries shared similar age and sex distributions, but Saudi Arabia had the highest CFR (35.1%), probably due to a higher proportion of underlying conditions . Republic of Korea had the highest proportion (> 99%) of hospital infections and the shortest time (median = 4 days) from disease onset to diagnosis, yet its CFR (18.8%) is comparable to that of UAE (16.1%). UAE had the highest proportion of asymptomatic infections and the longest survival time among fatal cases .\nCases with animal contact were older, more likely to be male, and more likely to have underlying conditions and a longer delay from disease onset to diagnosis, in comparison to cases without 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. These characteristics of cases with animal contact could partially explain their significantly higher CFR (35.1% vs 24.3%, P < 0.001) than those without animal contact 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. However, among fatal cases, those with animal contact had a slightly longer survival time than those without (median = 11.5 vs 9 days, P < 0.001). Cases with only patient contact were more likely to be health-care workers and more likely to be asymptomatic 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. The proportion of cases with animal contact was increasing from 2012 to 2018 and seemed to stabilize thereafter. Epidemics peaked mostly between April and September 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. In contrast, cases with animal contact were more likely to occur from January to March. Seasonality differed slightly between countries, e.g. peaks of zoonotic infections in UAE were also observed in May. The peak of the global epidemic in June of 2015 was due to the opportunistic outbreak in Republic of Korea, which does not necessarily reflect seasonality in the endemic setting.\nAll the eight individual-level factors (age group, sex, living in the Middle East, healthcare worker, underlying conditions, animal contact history before onset, delay from disease onset to diagnosis and onset year) were significantly associated with mortality in the univariate analysis, with age and underlying condition as the leading factors with OR > 5 . We identified a multivariate model containing all eight main effects, as well as two-way interactions among age group, sex and animal contact. After controlling for other factors, underlying condition was associated with 3.5-fold increase in the risk (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 2.5-4.89), whereas being a healthcare worker was protective (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.21-0.54). OTC ≥ 5 days increased the risk by 31% (95% CI: 5-63%). Compared to 2012-2014, the risk of death was higher during 2015-2016 (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.27-2.09) but lower during 2017-2019 (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.53-0.92).\nLogistic regression analyses of potential risk factors for mortality among Middle East respiratory syndrome cases, September 2012-June 2020\n删除重复语句：<u>Logistic regression analyses of potential risk factors for mortality among Middle East respiratory syndrome cases, September 2012-June 2020</u>\nCFR case fatality rate, OR odds ratio, CI confidence Interval, OTC Time from disease onset to confirmation\n§OTC have missing values.

The older age group (≥ 65 years) was associated with a higher risk of death in general, with significant ORs ranging 1.64-10.52 for all combinations of sex and animal contact history 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. However, the age effect was more prominent among patients without animal contact. Among patients without animal contact, the adjusted OR were 5.65 (95% CI: 3.75-8.50) for males and 10.52 (95% CI: 6.46-17.11) for females, compared to 1.64 (95% CI: 1.03-2.62) for males and 3.06 (95% CI: 1.59-5.86) for females among those with animal contact. From these estimates, it is also clear that the age effect was more prominent among female patients compared to male patients. Sex did not affect the risk of death significantly, although males tended to have higher risk among the younger age group without animal contact 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. A history of animal contact was associated with a higher risk (adjusted OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.10-7.98) among female cases < 65 years but with a lower risk (adjusted OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.18-0.51) among male cases ≥ 65 years old 通用删除1(英):<u></u>.

The disease spread more rapidly towards the east (UAE and Oman) than towards other directions . The diffusion appears to be acerating in recent years. At the second administrative level, 12 of the 14 eco-geographic variables were associated with the spread of MERS in the univariable Cox regressions . In the multivariate analysis, positive associations with the disease diffusion were found for seven factors, and the top three drivers are intersection with main roads [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 15.45, 95% CI: 2.11-113.26, P = 0.007], intersection with railways (adjusted HR = 2.33, 95% CI:1.37-3.97, P = 0.002) and elevation (adjusted HR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.47-3.91, P < 0.001). A higher coverage of cropland seemed to have impeded the disease diffusion (adjusted HR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.27-0.95, P = 0.034). We overlaid the land coverage and transportation networks with the spatiotemporal distribution of the first reported cases in each space unit . In the Arabian Peninsula, intersection with major roads and railroads was clearly associated with earlier invasion.\nSurvival analyses on the time to the first reported Middle East respiratory syndrome case in each space unit, September 2012-June 2020\n删除重复语句：<u>Survival analyses on the time to the first reported Middle East respiratory syndrome case in each space unit, September 2012-June 2020</u>\nBIO1 annual average temperature, BIO2 average diurnal range of temperature, BIO3 isothermality, BIO4 temperature seasonality, BIO5 max temperature of warmest month, BIO12 Annual precipitation\nTurkey and Iran are excluded in this analysis.

These sequences were collected between 2011 and 2019 from 15 countries, and 90.0% of them were from Middle East. IQ-Tree selected the GTR and FreeRate with ten categories as the best substitution model for these sequences.\nAn initial analysis showed that sequences from bat and hedgehog form a separate clade distant from the main clade of sequences from humans, camels and Lama glama 通用删除1(英):<u></u>, confirming that camel is the major zoonotic reservoir of MERS-CoV for spillover to human. We excluded the ten sequences from bat and hedgehog from subsequent analyses. The main clade of human, camel and llama strains, named clade C, contains five subclades numbered C1-C5, with C5 being the largest subclade with 398 sequences . Overall, sequences from human and camel mixed throughout the whole tree, indicating multiple introduction events from camel to human. Nevertheless, the human and camel sequences sampled after 2016 in our database were genetically distant from each other. The root ancestor of clade C, dated back to January 2007 (confidence interval: April 2006-September 2008), was 49.3% likely from camel and 50.7% likely from human. The case mortality rates differed between clades in the phylogenetic tree. C5 was associated with a higher mortality rate than other clades 通用删除1(英):<u>(a difference of 1% in CFR, P-value = 2.0×10-4, Fig. 3)</u>. A sub-clade of C5, C5.1, showed an even higher mortality rate than clades C1-C4 (a difference of 4% in CFR, P-value < 2.2×10-16). Compared to subclades C1-C4, we found non-synonymous mutations in regions encoding the ORF3 protein 通用删除11(英):<u>(P86L)</u> and the NS4B protein (M6T) among the C5.1 sequences as well as in regions encoding the 1AB protein (S6737N), the NS4A protein 通用删除11(英):<u>(P106S)</u>, and the Membrane protein (V69I) among other C5 sequences.\nThe spatiotemporal transmission pattern of clade C was characterized by intense local migration within the Middle East and occasional long distance exportation 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. The top three most likely locations of the inferred root ancestor were Riyadh of Saudi Arabia, the Nile Delta region and Jordan with posterior probabilities of 31%, 17% and 12%, respectively. Riyadh appeared to be the major source exporting infections both locally and internationally. It was estimated with 99% posterior probability as the location of common ancestral node for subclades C3, C4, and C5 which cover 97.5% of the collected sequences. Early exportation of the virus to Egypt and Jordan likely occurred before 2010. The circulation of MERS-CoV among dromedary camels in East Africa possibly started before 2010. The model inferred migration of the virus from Egypt to Ethiopia during 2011-2013 and subsequently to Kenya during 2014-2017, partly supported by a serological study conducted in Egypt in 2013 that found both domestic dromedary camels and those imported from Ethiopia were seropositive 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. Intense migration of the virus from Riyadh towards local cities in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi in UAE and Europe started during 2011-2012. Abu Dhabi soon joined Riyadh as the second hub exporting the virus to other Middle East cities as well as to Europe. The opportunistic exportation events from the Middle East to the United States in 2014 and to East Asia in 2015 were correctly captured by the model.\nTo identify key genetic sites affecting the transmissibility of MERS-CoV from animals to human, we performed positive selection analysis on the collected sequences. Based on the phylogenetic tree, we focused on two branches with potentially high selection pressure 通用删除1(英):<u></u>, the branch separating the hedgehog-related clade from the clades among bat, camel and human (branch A), and the one separating the bat-related sequences from clade C among camel and human (branch B). We tested whether specific sites underwent positive selection along branches A or B using the branch-site test model implemented in the codeML program of the PAML package. For branch A, we identified three proteins (NS3, 1AB polyprotein and nucleoprotein) and 59 sites in the 1AB polyprotein under positive selection 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. For branch B, we identified two different proteins (ORF8b and spike glycoprotein) and eight sites in the spike glycoprotein under positive selection. Three of the eight spike glycoprotein sites, 77:Y, 486:H and 636:Q have not been previously reported. No positive selection was detected in the spike glycoprotein for branch A.\nCombining updated case data, genetic data and relevant socioenvironmental data, we provided an in-depth analysis of the epidemiology of MERS and genetic evolution of MERS-CoV in the most affected regions. Countries in the Middle East, particularly the Saudi Arabia, continue to be the epicenter of MERS, with frequent animal-to-human spillovers in the region and sporadic exportation of human cases to other continents. Patients ≥ 65 years old or with underlying conditions had a significantly higher risk of death. The effect of animal contact on the risk of death depends on both age and sex. Transportation network was the leading driver for the spatial diffusion of the disease.\nWe identified marked differences in demographic and clinical features of cases between the two transmission modes, human-to-human vs animal-to-human, e.g. cases with animal contact tended to be older, more likely to be male and symptomatic, and more likely to have underlying conditions and longer delay of diagnosis. The two modes also differ in seasonality. Animal-to-human transmission events occurred mainly between January and March, and human-to-human transmission peaks subsequently from April to June 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. This temporal order reflects the importance of blocking animal-to-human spillover in early spring. Preventive measures such as educational campaigns and advocating personal protection equipment among workers of camel farms and trading posts can be used to reduce zoonotic infection in the high-risk season.\nRisk factors for case fatality in our analyses includes the elderly (≥ 65 years old), male sex, Middle Eastern residents, underlying diseases, and animal exposure, which are in line with previous findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Our analyses further revealed that the dependence of the risk of fatality on animal contact history varied by age group and sex. animal contact history was a risk factor for death in female patients < 65 years old but was protective in male patients ≥ 65 years old. This observation could be explained by the possibility that, in the Middle East, longterm exposure to dromedary camels has built immunity in older males, and opportunistic exposure of fully susceptible females, especially those younger than 65 years, could be more lethal. This possibility is partly supported by the higher seroprevalence in older males than other age and sex groups 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. Special attention should be paid and timely treatment should be provided to young female and old male patients upon admission or diagnosis to prevent severe adverse outcomes.\nWe found the road and railway traffic network played an important role in the rapid regional dispersion of MERS. While the virus has not gained efficient human-to-human transmissibility, the frequent domestic and international migrations of infected humans and animals within the Middle East and between the Middle East and the rest of the world are imposing a sustained risk of viral adaption to human immune system, similar to SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak involving 186 cases and 36 deaths in the Republic of Korea highlighted this threat 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Surveillance and screening of infected travelers at transportation hubs such as international airports, are needed, especially in areas with frequent travelers from and to the epidemic areas. Avoiding congestion of dromedary herds at watering sites and during their transportation is likely an effective control measure to reduce the circulation of the virus in its natural animal reservoir and thereby to reduce the chance of spillover to humans. Vaccination of dromedary camels could be a better option depending on the development progress and availability of effective vaccines 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>.\nOur phylogenetic analysis estimated that the inferred root ancestor was 49.3% likely from camel and 50.7% likely from human, different from another study that reported camel to be the sole possible host of ancestral root 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. This gap might result from the differences in model structures and assumptions as well as in sequence samples. In a sensitivity analysis, we down-sampled sequences after 2014 and estimated camel to be the host of root ancestor with a posterior probability of 99.4%, suggesting existing sequences may not represent the true spatiotemporal distribution of the underlying viral population and hence may lead to biased and unstable estimation. Likewise, we also caution the interpretation of the potential association of clade C5 with a higher mortality rate, which needs to be verified in the future.\nOur phylogeographic analysis revealed the dissemination history of MERS-CoV both within the Middle East and from the peninsula to other continents. The spatiotemporal transmission pattern of clade C was basically consistent with the spatiotemporal distribution of cases at the individual level and early diffusion at the population level. The fact that Abu Dhabi of UAE became the second hub for international exportation of the virus is highly alarming, indicating the necessity of screening MERS-CoV-infected travelers at international airports. However, there still exists inconsistency between some fine details of model-estimated migration trajectories and epidemiological data. For example, the patient who traveled from Saudi Arabia to Chicago was shown by the model as coming from UAE, and the first exportation to East Asia was misplaced at Southern China instead of Republic of Korea 通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35]</u>. However, such inconsistency in fine details does not alter the big picture of intense local migration in the Middle East and early circulation in the northern and eastern Africa. Future phylogeographic analysis should incorporate prior epidemiological information if such methodology becomes available.\nWe identified eight amino acid positions in the spike glycoprotein potentially associated with positive selection, three of which are novel sites. The spike glycoprotein is known to mediate viral entry and affect the host range of MERS-CoV and had been previously reported to be under positive selection 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>. The novel sites found in this study may provide research directions for potential targets for development of antivirals and vaccines against MERS-CoV 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>.\nA few limitations of the study are worth mentioning. First, the passive surveillance systems of MERS in most countries only capture patients who sought medical care, while patients with subclinical or asymptomatic infections are usually missed. This surveillance bias may affect our assessment of the relationship between animal contact history and asymptomatic infection. Second, not all relevant risk drivers or confounders were considered in our diffusion analysis and the regression model for case fatality due to lack of data, e.g. the density of dromedary camels and the number of healthcare facilities. Finally, the potential sampling bias in the whole-genome sequences could have affected the phylogenetic, phylogeographic and positive selection analyses, which may not be fully addressable by down-sampling.\nDespite its current incompetence for human-to-human transmission, MERS-CoV has successfully expanded its enzootic range throughout the Middle East, North and East Africa, and West and Southwest Asia, and imposing imminent pandemic threat through genetic mutation or recombination with other human coronaviruses, especially given the widespread of SARS-CoV-2. Active surveillance of adapting mutants among human patients and animal reservoir, as well as screening of infected travelers at transportation hubs such as international airports, are urgently needed. While the rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines shed lights on how to advance MERS-CoV vaccine candidates, nonpharmaceutical interventions and animal vaccines should be planned ahead to delay or block the adaption of MERS-CoV at the source.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-021-00853-0.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Additional tables and figures.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Two types of CSP have been described: one is characterized by implantation of the gestational sac (GS) on the scar with progression toward either the cervico-isthmic space or the uterine cavity and may develop into a viable birth; another is a deep GS implantation into a postcesarean section defect with progression toward rupture and hemorrhage during the first trimester of pregnancy.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The following criteria of ultrasound findings have been outlined for the diagnosis of CSP: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an empty uterus with a clear view of the endometrial layer; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> an empty cervical canal; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> a discontinuity in the anterior wall of the uterus, demonstrated on a sagittal view of the uterus when the direction of the ultrasound beam runs through the amniotic sac; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the GS located in the anterior part of the isthmus of the uterus, with a diminished myometrial layer between the bladder and the sac.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u> If not diagnosed and treated appropriately, CSP may cause hemorrhage and uterine rupture and may require hysterectomy.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Even with timely intervention, the possibility of intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage still exists.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>\nMany treatment strategies have been reported, most of which aim to preserve the uterus.

To explore the indications for various treatment strategies for CSP in the first and second trimester, the clinical records of 182 patients were retrospectively analyzed.\nClinical information of 182 CSP patients who received treatment in our hospital between January 2011 and April 2014 was retrospectively analyzed. The patients’ mean age was 34.0 ± 4.9 years; median gravidity was 3 (range 1–8); median parity was 1 (range 1–2); median cesarean section was 1 (range 1–2); and mean gestational age was 51.1 ± 14.6 通用删除7(英):<u>(28–120)</u> days, with three patients in the second trimester of pregnancy; time interval from the last cesarean section was 6.1 ± 4.2 (0.5–20) years; preoperative serum β-HCG was 52,703.2 ± 52,837.0 (17.9–200,000) mIU/mL. Inclusion criteria were women with Type 2 CSP in the first or second trimester. Exclusion criteria were patients who had received curettage or mifepristone or MTX treatment before admission. All patients signed informed consent forms before treatment. This study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital.\nThe patients were divided into five treatment groups: Group A (n = 102), uterine artery chemoembolization (UACE) followed by D&C; Group B (n = 63), D&C; Group C (n = 6), hysteroscopic removal of CSP; Group D (n = 6), laparotomy; and Group E (n = 5), laparoscopic dissection of CSP and repair of the uterus. Clinical history, laboratory and sonographic examination results, and curative effects of the five methods were collected and analyzed.

After the intubation and angiography, a 100–150 mg dose of MTX and 80,000 units of gentamicin were infused bilaterally before the embolization procedure with gelatin sponge particles (diameter of 0.7–1.0 mm). When the blood flow of bilateral uterine artery was slower, the arteries were embolized with fresh gelatin sponge particles (diameter of 2–3 mm) until the blood flow stopped. With the head of the catheter back in the iliac artery, extubation was exerted after satisfactory embolization was confirmed by angiography. The puncture point was locally bandaged by a hemostatic instrument for artery with pressure for 8 h. Within 48 h after UACE, D&C was performed on all patients under the guidance of ultrasound.\nType 2 CSP with gestational age ≤65 days and little blood supply to the GS.\nGS removal with D&C under the guidance of ultrasound was performed. Some patients received preoperative oral mifepristone for cervical preparation or mifepristone combined with misoprostol to induce abortion. After most of the GS had been discharged, a D&C was performed for the remaining pregnancy tissue in the scar. In some occasions, a Foley catheter balloon was placed into the isthmic portion of the cervix to reduce continuous bleeding with a total volume of <80 mL.\nType 2 CSP with gestational age ≤90 days.\nA hysteroscopic examination would first be performed to locate the GS, and then, the GS would be removed with hysteroscopic electrode resection and/or suction curettage.\nType 2 CSP with the thickness of the anterior myometrium ≤2 mm and profuse blood supply to the GS or CSP in the second trimester.\nUnder general anesthesia, six units of diluted pituitrin was injected into the myometrium. An incision was made through the serosa, myometrium, and endometrium of the protruding area with a unipolar electric knife, the CSP was removed using grasping forceps, and the uterine cavity and lower uterine segment underwent curettage. Fifty mg/m2 of MTX was injected into the myometrium of the lower uterine segment, and the cesarean scar tissue was trimmed at the incision margin and sutured continuously.\nType 2 CSP with the thickness of the anterior myometrium ≤2 mm and profuse blood supply to the GS.\nThe general procedure was similar to that for open surgery, with the main difference being use of minimally invasive techniques and instruments.\nSPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc.

The laparotomy group required the longest hospitalization, followed by hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, and UACE + D&C groups. No significant differences were detected between groups in the percentage by which β-HCG decreased in 3 days after treatment (P = 0.684) and the time of β-HCG normalization (P = 0.369), which indicates that the treatment selected for each group was equally effective in clearing trophoblastic tissue. The time of menstruation recovery was not significantly different between groups (P = 0.219) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3 and Figure 3]</u>.\nFive patients had 25.3 ± 26.9% (4.5%–70.1%) elevation of serum β-HCG after UACE, and 31 had 41.3 ± 25.6% (0.3%–91.3%) decrease. Patients with intraoperative blood loss of >200 mL had greater diameter of GS (48.4 ± 20.6 mm) and less thickness of the anterior myometrium (0.8 ± 1.4 mm) compared with those with a blood loss of <200 mL 通用删除8(英):<u>[P < 0.05, Table 4]</u>. Three cases in the second trimester were all in Group D. Two were sonographically diagnosed with placenta accreta and treated with UACE before laparotomy, with moderate blood loss (100 and 200 mL, respectively); the third case was treated with D&C initially, followed by severe hemorrhage, and was transferred for emergent laparotomy.\nLaboratory examination and sonographic features of patients with different volumes of bleeding\n删除重复语句：<u>Laboratory examination and sonographic features of patients with different volumes of bleeding</u>\nGS: Gestational sac; β-HCG: Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin.\nThe incidence of CSP has been increasing in recent years. Many reports have described different treatment strategies for CSP with various success rates and complications. Most were case reports or comparisons of two different treatment strategies,通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13,14,15]</u> but none compared the effectiveness of a wide range of treatment strategies, especially for cases in the second trimester.\nA study by Lan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> on 79 patients concluded that a diagnosis of CSP should receive UACE as the primary treatment. In our data, compared with the D&C group, those who underwent UACE combined with D&C had significantly larger GS and decreased thickness of the anterior myometrium, while the intraoperative blood loss and postoperative decline of β-HCG were not significantly different between the two groups. This indicates that our criteria for the choice of UACE before D&C in some patients were appropriate. Wang and Tseng stated that D&C is suitable only for CSP patients with gestational age below 7 weeks in whom there is no indication of deep sac implantation.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> However, our data showed that UACE helped expand the indication for D&C.\nHCG is produced primarily by differentiated syncytiotrophoblasts and represents an embryonic signal that is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> We also found that after UACE, some patients did not have an obvious decline of β-HCG, and a few even rise. It is reported that the half-life of serum β-HCG is approximately 24 h. Therefore, on 24 h after removal of GS, the concentration of β-HCG should decline to half of the preoperative level and reduce by half in every subsequent 24 h.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> A persistent high level of β-HCG after UACE may reflect that failure to remove the trophoblastic tissue, and the destruction of trophoblastic cells by MTX may even cause β-HCG to be secreted into the circulation.\nLaparoscopic operation has some advantages in dealing with CSP.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> The defect in the scar could be repaired, which may reduce the risk of uterine rupture and CSP in the future. However, this procedure requires the operator to be well equipped with laparoscopic skills.\nThe laparotomy group had the greatest GS diameter and the minimum thickness of the anterior myometrium. Compared with laparoscopy, laparotomy causes greater trauma with longer postoperative recovery time and hospital stay, but hemostatic procedure such as suturing is relatively simpler and more convenient, especially for more complicated cases as those in the second trimester. Therefore, laparotomy should be chosen over laparoscopy when the situation is more emergent and complicated. Moreover, the choice also depends on the laparoscopic skill of a surgeon. Two laparotomy cases without UACE had much greater average intraoperative blood loss than the other four with UACE, which suggests that for patients with greater risk of heavy bleeding, UACE should be considered as a pretreatment for laparotomy to reduce the risk of hemorrhage.\nTimor-Tritsch and Monteagudo通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> deemed that in the case of CSP, local MTX and hysteroscopy directed procedures had the lowest complication rates. The electrocoagulation function of hysteroscopy can effectively reduce the blood loss during surgery, and the hemostatic effect of UACE may not be as important in patients who are going to be treated with hysteroscopy as in those with D&C.\nWhen heavy bleeding occurs during surgery, effective methods need to be adopted. Utilization of chemoembolization, Foley catheter balloon, bilateral uterine artery ligation, or transitions to laparoscopy or laparotomy have all been reported to be effective measures.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,22,23,24,25]</u> In our hospital, the remedies for extensive hemorrhage include direct transition to laparotomy or laparoscopy, emergent UACE to block the blood supply of the uterine arteries, intrauterine packing with gauze, Foley catheter compression, or a combination of several methods, which all proved effective to reduce bleeding under different circumstances. The reason that laparoscopy and laparotomy groups had the greatest amount of blood loss was partially because they were adopted as remedy measures after hemorrhage in D&C, and the total blood loss was counted together.\nIn this study, we retrospectively analyzed Type 2 CSP cases from our clinical practice. However, our study has certain limitations. First, multiple operators were involved, thus raising the issue of bias. Second, the number of cases in the second trimester was relatively small and may have compromised our results. The number of cases in the hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, and laparotomy was comparatively smaller. However, these were the actual number of treatment given during the time span of our study, which also indicates that UACE and D&C would suffice for the treatment of most of the Type 2 CSP patients in the first trimester. Future prospective studies with a larger sample of second-trimester CSP cases may provide better guidance for appropriate treatment of CSP.\nIn conclusion, the sonographic findings of diameter of GS, thickness of the anterior myometrium, and preoperative serum β-HCG level are important factors for the treatment choice-making. Large GS size and deep infiltration of GS are indicative of the risk of intraoperative hemorrhage. UACE combined with D&C is a useful measure for most Type 2 CSP cases in the first trimester. For Type 2 CSP cases in the second trimester, UACE before laparotomy should be a reasonable choice.\nWe would like to thank all the gynecologists in our hospital for their valued input into the care of the patients discussed in this article.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Henan Cancer Hospital 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 201401017)</u>. Sections were incubated with HPV (ZM-0217, CAMVIR-1), p16 (ZM-0205, 1C1), p53 (ZM-0405, BP53.12), or Rb (ZM-0223, 13A10) antibodies from Beijing Zhongshan Jinqiao Biotechnology Co. Ltd, China as the primary antibodies and biotinylated goat antirabbit IgG as the secondary antibody. The RNA of HPV 16/18 was detected by the RNAscope 2.5 Assay Reagent Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc. Hayward, CA, USA). All statistical analysis were performed using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Fisher exact test was used to identify predictors for HPV-positive tumors. The analysis of the 5-year survival rate between different groups was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Differences with a value of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nThe characteristics of 73 ESCC patients were analyzed and revealed that there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to age (P= 0.708), stage (P= 0.788), T category (P= 0.417), N category (P= 0.788), differentiation grade (P= 0.141), smoking (P= 0.445), and alcohol consumption (P= 0.940). The positive cases of HPV, p53, p16, and Rb were 33 (45.2%), 40 (54.8%), 5 (6.8%), and 32 (43.8%), respectively. The mRNA expression of HPV 16/18 detected through RNAscope 2.5 Assay was negative. The HPV infection in the esophageal mucosa of 20 normal people was all negative. The cases of co-positive HPV and p16, p53, and Rb were 3 (4.1%), 22 (30.1%), and 12 (16.4%), respectively. Among the 73 ESCC patients (for five cases, survival information could not be confirmed), the total number of deaths was 24, and the 5-year survival was evaluated to compare the prognosis from the different groups. The number of deaths of patients with positive HPV, p16, p53, and Rb were 9, 1, 14, and 12; and the number of deaths of patients with negative HPV, p16, p53, and Rb were 15, 23, 10, and 12, respectively.

Mutations in the p53 and p16 genes can disrupt the cell cycle regulatory mechanism and induce cell hyperplasia and tumors growth. The rate of HPV infection in 73 ESCC patients was 45.3%; however, statistical analysis showed that the HPV, p16, p53, and Rb were not correlated with the 5-year survival rate of ESCC (all P > 0.05). HPV infection may be related to the occurrence of ESCC, but it is not related to the 5-year survival rate of ESCC patients.

Individual anesthetic agents are known to have unique effects on brain function. Compared to other halogenated anesthetics, sevoflurane demonstrated an intrinsic cerebral vasodilatory effect, inducing a dose-dependent increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and decrease in cerebrovascular resistance.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Propofol can reduce both cerebral metabolism and regional CBF, and has been recommended as an ideal hypnotic for neurosurgical procedures.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> General anesthetics may alter consciousness by changing membrane lipid interactions and protein properties (such as ion channel gating and second messenger signaling).通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> In addition, several studies have shown that anesthetic agents can affect the expression of genes in the brain.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22nt-long, single-stranded noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3’-untranslated regions of target mRNAs. This initiates formation of silencing complexes that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression by translational repression, mRNA cleavage, and mRNA decay initiated by miRNA-guided rapid deadenylation.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Through translational repression, miRNAs are critical regulators of cell proliferation, inflammation, and metabolism; indeed, miRNAs negatively regulate more than 30% of the transcriptome.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> miRNAs are also essential for neurogenesis and brain development, synaptic plasticity,通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and responses to pathological insults like stroke.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia also altered miRNA expression patterns in healthy rat liver.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>\nWe speculated that sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia affected miRNA expression in the brain as well. To confirm this, we conducted miRNA microarray chip analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on rat brain tissues following general anesthesia induced by clinical doses of sevoflurane or propofol.\nAnimal care and sacrifice were conducted according to methods approved by the Animal Research Committee, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University. RNA labeling and hybridization on miRNA microarray chips were performed by Capital-Bio (Beijing, China). Other experiments were preceded in the central lab of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University.\nSeven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. Beijing, China) weighing 250 ± 10 g were housed in plastic cages in an animal room under a controlled 12 h light-dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water for 1-week before experiments. Rats were then randomly divided into three groups, each group consisting four rats. Rats in the sevoflurane group were administered 2% sevoflurane (AbbVie Inc. North Chicago, IL, USA) and those in the propofol group were infused with 1% propofol at 600 μg·kg−1·min−1 (AstraZeneca Plc, London, UK) from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Control group was kept in the same anesthesia box for 6 h breathing regular air.\nA catheter was inserted into the tail vein of all rats without anesthesia to deliver normal saline at 1 mL/h during treatment. Each rat was allowed to breathe spontaneously in the anesthesia box supplied with an air-oxygen mixture (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.6) at 3 L/min, body temperature was maintained at approximately 37°C during ventilation/anesthesia using a heat lamp. Rats were decapitated at 3:00 PM. The left cortex of the brain was obtained from each rat within 1 min after death. Brain samples were washed twice with 4°C phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) and immediately stored at − 80°C. Total RNA was extracted using the mirVana miRNAIsolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by a NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Waltham, MA, USA). An A260/280 of 1.8 or more was required for subsequent quantitative analysis of miRNAs using miRNA microarray.\nPhysiological variables were measured in three parallel groups of rats (6/group) during sevoflurane, propofol, or control treatment. To monitor heart rate as well as arterial blood pressure, PO2, PCO2, and pH, catheters were inserted into the tail artery and vein after intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (0.6 mg/kg). After full recovery from chloral hydrate anesthesia, rats in the anesthesia groups were administered the same doses of sevoflurane or propofol used for miRNA expression studies. Blood samples were taken 3 and 6 h after the induction of sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia. In the control group, blood samples were taken 3 and 6 h after full recovery from chloral hydrate anesthesia.\nRNA labeling and hybridization on miRNA microarray chips were performed by Capital-Bio (Beijing, China). Briefly, 200 ng total RNA was labeled with Cy3 using the miRNA Complete Labeling and Hyb Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc. CA, USA) and hybridized to arrays in a hybridization oven (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) at 55°C and 20 r/min for 20 h. The miRNA microarray chip contained 677 preloaded rat miRNAprobes, all cataloged in the Sanger miRBase V16.0 (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). After hybridization, the microarrays were washed in staining dishes (Thermo Shandon, Waltham, MA, USA) with the Gene Expression Wash Buffer Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Hybridization data were extracted by Agilent Feature Extraction (v10.7, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) software and analyzed usingAgilent GeneSpring. Data are expressed as threshold cycle (Ct) values, the fractional cycle number at which the sample fluorescence signal surpasses a fixed threshold above baseline.\nTo verify the accuracy of microarray data, we performed individual qRT-PCR measurements on seven miRNAs differentially expressed by anesthetic-treated brain relative to control brain on the samples which we did the microarray analysis: Rno-miR-466b-1*, rno-miR-339-3p, rno-miR-347, rno-miR-378*, rno-miR-412*, rno-miR-448, and rno-miR-7a-2*.We could not find the primers for miR-702-3p and miR-3584-5p from the database, so we did not perform qRT-PCR for these two miRNAs. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and RT performed using the Takara RT Reagent Kit (Takara Bio, Japan). Each reaction mixture for RT contained 200 ng RNA template, 1.2 µl miRNA RT primer, 4 µl RT buffer 5X, 1 µl RT enzyme mix, and RNase-free water in a total volume of 20 µl. Reaction mixtures were then incubated for 30 min at 37°C and for 5 s at 85°C.\nThe PCR reactions were performed using the Takara SYBR Premix Ex Taq Kit (Takara Bio, Japan) and Thermal Cycler Dice Real-time System (Takara Bio, Japan). The 20 µl qPCR reaction mixture contained 10 μl SYBR Green Mix, 1 μl miRNA RT Product, 0.8 μl miRNAForward Primer (10 μmol/L), 0.8 μl miRNAReverse Primer (10 μmol/L) (Ibsbio Co. Ltd. China), and RNase-free water. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 62°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 30 s, and finally 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 95°C for 15 s.\nThe expression of each miRNAwas normalized using U6 as the internal control and group differences calculated as the inverse log of the ΔΔCt to yield the relative fold-change in miRNA levels. The PCR reaction for each miRNAwas repeated 3 times using separate reaction mixtures.\nChanges in miRNA expression are presented using heat maps. These heat maps are commonly used for visualization of high-dimensional data by two-dimensional images, with colors representing the intensity values. After individually clustering columns (samples) and rows (miRNAs), the heat map simultaneously displays the separate sample and miRNA clusters in one graphic. The magnitude of miRNA expression changes is denoted by color, and the corresponding numbers are the ΔCt values.\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc. USA). All data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Physiological data among the control, sevoflurane, and propofol groups were compared by repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differential expression of miRNA using qRT-PCR among the control, sevoflurane, and propofol groups were compared by one-way ANOVA. Anesthesia-regulated miRNAs were defined as those with a mean fold-change (increase or decrease) greater than 2 and values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant when compared to the control group.\nAll rats survived until sacrifice and data from all animals were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in the measured physiological parameters between anesthesia groups and the control group, and no incidences of hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypocapnia, hypotension, hypothermia, or hyperthermia 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.\nPhysiological data among the control, sevoflurane, and propofol groups (n = 6)\n删除重复语句：<u>Physiological data among the control, sevoflurane, and propofol groups (n = 6)</u>\nHR: Heart rate; MAP: Mean arterial pressure.\nMicroarray analysis detected 277 of 677 preloaded miRNAs (40.9%).

Expression levels of rno-miR-339-3p, rno-miR-448, and rno-miR-466b-1* were significantly increased after sevoflurane anesthesia compared to controls (P < 0.05), whereas rno-miR-339-3p, rno-miR-347, rno-miR-378*, rno-miR-412*, and rno-miR-7a-2* were increased by propofol (P < 0.05). The expression of rno-miR-466b-1* was significantly increased after sevoflurane anesthesia compared to propofol (P < 0.05).\nA variety of structurally distinct molecules acting on transmitter receptors, ion channels, and other protein targets induce general anesthesia.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Neuroimaging has revealed that different anesthetics induce both global and region-specific reductions in cerebral metabolic rate and blood flow.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Anesthetics also alter functional connectivity.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> However, the ultimate question of how general anesthetics reversibly alter human consciousness remains obscure. These agents also alter gene expression, but the specific changes in expression pattern induced by individual general anesthetics and how these changes affect brain function in both the intraoperative and postoperative periods remain largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that two widely used general anesthetics, propofol and sevoflurane, alter miRNA expression patterns. This may provide a new angel to understand the mechanism of anesthetic agents of the brain. Three of these miRNAs were specifically upregulated by only one of these agents, suggesting that different anesthetics induce unique changes in neural protein expression patterns that may in turn explain their specific neurological effects.\nIndividual miRNAs are conserved across species and expressed in both spatially and temporally specific patterns during development and under varying physiological conditions.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> Each miRNA can bind 100 different target mRNAs on average, and the same target gene may be regulated by a given miRNA only under specific conditions, allowing for enormous regulatory complexity and flexibility. Indeed, region-specific miRNAs in the brain can establish and maintain the protein expression profiles underlying regional cellular phenotypes.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Expression of several miRNAs also changes under pathological conditions.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> In the current study, we identified 9 miRNAs (miR-466b-1*, miR-3584-5p, miR-702-3p, miR-339-3p, miR-347, miR-448, miR-378*, miR-412*, and miR-7a-2*) that may be involved in the mechanism of general anesthetic action in the mammalian CNS.\nThe anesthesia-regulated miRNA-339-3p binds to the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) mRNA 3’-UTR and suppresses receptor activity, thereby acting as a negative feedback modulator of MOR signaling. Thus, these anesthetic may alter MOR signaling, consistent with the time- and dose-dependent regulation of MOR expression by propofol in human neuroblastoma cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> MiRNAs may also impact higher cognitive function such as learning and memory. MiR-132 and miR-212 differentially alter long-term potentiation, a neurocellular model of associative learning, in the hippocampus and neocortex.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> MiR-132 expression decreases both in Alzheimer’s disease patients’ prefrontal cortex and hippocampus area and in their serum, also it is provided that miR-132 may contribute to disease progression.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> The microarray results of our research showed that miR-132 expression in rat cortex as well as decreased about 40% by propofol and 30% by sevoflurane (data is not shown), which strongly suggests anesthetics possess neurotoxicity and anesthetics play important function to general anesthesia caused postoperative cognitive dysfunction. MiR-466b, a miRNA upregulated by sevoflurane but not propofol, is strongly expressed in the marginal division (MrD) compared to the hippocampus, since previous study has shown that MrD - basal nucleus of Meynert-hippocampus circuit may play an important role in modulating learning and memory, mir-466b may play a possible role in this process.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Cerebral 5-HT receptors and subunits regulate aggressive behavior, and the 5-HT (2C) gene harbors the sevoflurane-regulated miR-448 in the 4th intron. In contrast to 5-HT (2C), miR-448 reduced adipocyte differentiation, again indicating a negative feedback relationship.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Reduced adipocyte differentiation may result from miR-448-mediated suppression of the transcription factor Krueppel-like factor 5.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> MiRNAs also regulate responses to brain ischemia and ischemic tolerance induced by ischemic preconditioning.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Transient focal ischemia in adult rat regulated the expression of miRNAs predicted to target proteins involved in signal transduction and ionic homeostasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> A recent study reported (propofol-regulated) miR-347 downregulation following ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and kainite-induced seizures, implicating this analgesic-related miRNA in the response to acute brain injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Melamed proposed that RNA splicing negatively regulates the processing of pre-miRNAs that overlap exon-intron junctions, and demonstrated that tissue-specific alternative splicing regulates maturation of miR-412, resulting in effects on its targets, a protein network involved in neuronal cell death.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> Upregulation of miR-412 by propofol anesthesia may account, at least in part, for the neuroprotective effects of this anesthetic.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u> Kim showed that sevoflurane-induced miR-702 promoted proliferation of Dgcr8-deficient embryonic stem cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Deng used chemically synthesized miR-Pirate to specifically silence mature miR-378, providing an experimental approach to study the function of this and other anesthetic-induced miRNAs.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> In contrast, little is known about miR-7a-2* and miR-3584-5p functions in the brain. As far as we know, this is the first study focusing on the miRNA expression after general anesthesia.\nOur study has several limitations. Although changes in miRNA expression are likely to affect subsequent protein levels, many additional dynamically regulated processes can alter protein expression while having no effect on gene expression. Indeed, the final functional entities in cells are not mRNAs and miRNAs, but proteins that undergo posttranslational modifications controlling activity, localization, and interactions with other proteins and molecules. This is just a preliminary study; further studies are needed to understand the functional consequences of these changes. Second, we used extracts of whole cortex as samples, but many miRNAs are expressed in more restricted regions. Therefore, it is possible that our results reflect a diluted response or summation of both suppression and activation in different regions. Third, we used 1% propofol with intralipid as solvent, not pure propofol, and we did no control for the effects of Intralipid on miRNA expression. Finally, we investigated only two anesthetics at fixed doses and did not evaluate the functional effects of these changes. Further research using miRNA antagonist or knockout animal models is needed to explore the functional implications of these anesthetic-dependent changes in miRNA expression.\nIn conclusions, we demonstrate that clinical doses of the anesthetics sevoflurane and propofol differentially regulate multiple miRNAs in the mammalian CNS. It may be very important to understand the mechanism of different anesthetic agents on brain. Further studies in protein expression are needed to determine the unique neurological effects of these agents.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

HIV/AIDS has transformed into a chronic, controllable, but-not-yet curable disease similar to other chronic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a pivotal aspect for both clinical outcomes and research in chronic diseases, which often requires complex and life-long management and therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. HRQoL points to the self-perceived health of a person with a unitary construct, including several psychological, social, occupational and physical domains, to cope with the complicated progression of chronic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u>. The United Nation UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets 删除2：<u>(by 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV will know their status, 90% of people diagnosed with HIV infection will receive sustained ART, and 90% of those receiving ART will virally suppressed)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> are increasingly being achieved in the future. The first-three 90% targets focus on epidemic control, and the addition of the so-called fourth 90% target, which included improved HRQoL for PLWHIV, required solutions beyond ART and viral load suppression 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Suitable HRQoL could become equally significant as the first-three targets. We could consider that—exploring the effects of specific factors on HRQoL could help appreciate the quality of health care received and support policy making throughout the entire prevention process.\nHRQoL seemed especially impaired among PLWHIV and was associated with many predictors. Previous studies have shown the determinants of HRQoL among PLWHIV. Most of them have emphasized the positive role of ART in improving the HRQoL of PLWHIV 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Some social demongraphic factors, such as education level, family economic status and employment status could also contribute to good global HRQoL 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Published reviews and meta-analyses have shown insufficient social support, stigma and discrimination, weak adherence to ART, low CD4+ T cell count and advanced HIV stage were linked with poor HRQoL 通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u>. These factors could be considered as the indictors at the individual level. Some researchers have hypothesized that the individual’s HRQoL is not only defined by their personal-level characteristics, but also socially determined by both physical and social environmental characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. This result indicated that we could consider the predictors associated with HRQoL for PLWHIV at both the individual and high levels. Based on the published studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,9,10,11]</u>, we summarized the predictors of HRQoL for PLWHIV into three categories: personality, social economic and strategies. For PLWHIV on ART, the effect of ART was strongly associated with adherence to ART, HIV care clinics and specialized HIV services, which are often defined by the local strategy inclination and professional technology. Otherwise, education level, family economics and employment status could be defined by the area-specific social economic level. Some studies have explored high-level factors to predict dependent variables. One study explored area deprivation, which was an independent effect isolated from the individual effect on adult depressive symptoms in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. One study revealed the family-level factors that influence adolescents’ global physical self-concept. The same result was also found in a study to determine the family clustering of depressive symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. For CD4 cell count, a study adopted the same analyses train of thought and demonstrated that the variation existed between patients occupied at 63% and within patients occupied at 37% 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. One study calculated the proportion of between-county variation in HRQoL that was explained by country-level contextual variables. There were also some studies to adopt the MLM to explore the different level predictors associated with HRQoL in overweight children, cancer patients, adolescents, neuropathic pain patients and cardiovascular patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[5,15,16,17,18]</u>. HIV/AIDS is a disease that requires comprehensive social prevention. Few studies have been conducted to explore the effects on the HRQoL of PLWHIV at different levels, especially at the strategy and area levels, which is critical for policy-making to accomplish the fourth 90% target.\nThe HRQoL of PLWHIV is an indicator that has multiple dimensions 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>, and the effects of predictors associated with HRQoL are always complicated. To guide public health policy, it would be informative to examine the variation in HRQoL among geographic areas and strategy differences. Our study will explore the role of personality, social economic and prevention strategy effects on health-related quality of life among people living with HIV/AIDS and the causal heterogeneity modified by social economic-level and strategy practice-level factors on individual factors to predict HRQoL of PLWHIV to evaluate the overall health in the areas and help improve local decision-making.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted among PLWHIV aged more than 16 years old in the 10 municipalities in Yunnan province, China from October 2019 to May 2020. A convinced sampling method was used. The sample size was calculated by the Yaro Yamane’s approach for finite population using the formula of n = N/(1 + N(e)2) 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. In our study, n stands for the expected sample size. N stands for the finite population that the sample derived from. We set a number of the total PLWHIV estimation of the ten selected areas. e stands for the level of significance and we set 0.05. Finally, the estimated sample size was 354. Based on the reported number of PLWHIVs of each municipality, a convenient sample of 150-200 was included for each selected area. We also excluded respondents with a cognitive impairment who were unwilling to finish the investigation. Our study total included 1997 participants. All investigators from local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and social organizations were trained strictly to implement the investigation face to face.\nIndividual-level HRQoL data were measured using the SF-12 and EQ-5D-5L. The 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), which is the shortened version of 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) could explain at least 90% of the accuracy of the SF-36 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. The SF-12 consists of eight domains to generate two separate summary scores, physical functional scores (PCS) and mental functional scores (MCS) ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicated better HRQoL. Cronbach’s α= 0.89. We also used EQ-5D-5L to measure HRQoL simultaneously. The EQ-5D-5L could define the 3125 possible health states by the different combinations. We adopted the Chinese population-based preference trade-off time (TTO) to transform the measures into utility index 通用删除1(英):<u>(UI, Table 1)</u>, thereby producing a single preference-based index ranging from -0.391 to 1.000, where 0 was equal to death and - 0.391 meant worse than death. For example, when we calculated a combination of \"21145\" , the UI equalled to 1 - 0.066 - 0 - 0 - 0.252 - 0.258= 0.424 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Cronbach’s α = 0.79.\nChinese value set for EQ-5D-5L health status\n删除重复语句：<u>Chinese value set for EQ-5D-5L health status</u>\n*EQ-5D-5L EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire, MO mobility dimension, SC self-care dimension, UA usual activities dimension, PD pain and discomfort dimension, UA pain and discomfort dimension, N3 constant term\nAll demographic data, including age, race/ethnicity, education level, marital status, household income per year, whether infection status was known to others, and HIV diagnosis variables including initial infection status, transmission model, duration of ART and the most recent CD4 counts were obtained using self-designed questionnaires.\nWe used the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) established by Xiao Shuiyuan in 1986 primarily for the Chinese population 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. It comprised ten items and three dimensions. A respondent’s social support was measured on three scales: objective social support, subjective social support and support utilization. The final social support was obtained by averaging all item scores from three dimensions. A higher total score demonstrated a higher level of perceived social support. Cronbach’s α= 0.68. Anxiety and depression were measured using Chinese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>, which is a short scale with 14 items designed for anxiety and depression diagnose in nonpsychiatric patients. Anxiety and depression were assessed using seven items respectively. Higher scores demonstrated more serious depression or anxiety symptoms. Cronbach’s α = 0.85.\nWe assembled municipal-level social economic data from the Yunnan Statistical Yearbook in 2020 carried out by the Statistical Bureau of Yunnan Province 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. We used gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, employment rate, birth rate, mortality rate and natural growth rate to calculate the municipal-level social economic effect, which was encouraged to measure the social economic status of the areas. Other municipal-level data about prevention strategy came from the evaluation system for the quality of strategy implemented, which was designed by Yunnan CDC, which included epidemic surveillance, the high-risk behaviour intervention, PLWHIV management, and follow-up and experimental management to construct the prevention strategy. The strategy could be formed different models including of the good quality strategy (stategy 1), the traditional strategy with advantage (strategy 2), the advanced strategy (strategy 3) and the general strategy (strategy 4).\nFor the statistical descriptive, we used the mean (standard deviation) and median (interquartile range) to describe the total HRQoL measured using EQ-5D-5L and PCS-12 and MSC-12, respectively.\nFor the statistical analysis, our study first used five indicators (GDP per capita, employment rate, birth rate, mortality rate and natural growth rate) to demonstrate the social economic effect. All six indicators (the epidemic surveillance score, the comprehensive score of female sex workers intervention, the comprehensive score of men has sex with men intervention, the comprehensive score of PLWHIV management and follow-up and the score of HIV laboratory testing quality) demonstrated the strategy implemented effect of each area. We used principal component analysis to build the social economic and strategy effects of each area. In view of the sensitivity to the dimensions for principal component analysis, all of the calculated indicators were adjusted between 0 and 1 using min-max standardization to eliminate the influence of dimension inconformity 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The standardization equation is shown as flowing.\nSij demonstrated the transferred i indicator of area j, xij demonstrated the original i indicator of area j, and xij(min) and xij(max) demonstrated the max and min i indicators in all areas.\nWe defined the principal components with reference to the variation greater than 80%, and also explanatory variables according to the practice for the social economic effect and strategy effect. In our study, for the social economic and strategy effect, the first and second component scores were calculated as follows:\nThe first component score=- 0.170×GDP per capita - 0.229×employment rate+0.387×birth rate+0.222×mortality rate +0.362×natural growth rate\nThe second component score =0.488×GDP per capita+ 0.434×employment rate+0.183×birth rate+0.322×mortality rate +0.112×natural growth rate\nFor the strategy practice effect, the first and second component scores were calculated as follows:\nThe first component score= 0.127 × epidemic surveillance score + 0.343 × the comprehensive score of female sex workers intervention+ 0.372 × the comprehensive score of men has sex with men intervention + 0.379 × the comprehensive score of PLWHIV management and follow-up+ 0.062 × the score of HIV laboratory testing quality\nThe second component score = 0.428 × epidemic surveillance score - 0.324 × the comprehensive score of female sex workers intervention+ 0.033 × the comprehensive score of men has sex with men intervention+ 0.011 × the comprehensive score of PLWHIV management and follow-up+ 0.648 × the score of HIV laboratory testing quality\nSecond, one-way ANOVA was used to perform univariate analysis to identify the predictors with significant differences. Candidates for multivariate analysis included the variables: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> professionals associated with HRQoL among PLWHIV; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> social support, anxiety and depression; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> variables at the level of P less than 0.1 in one-way ANOVA.\nOur study used a multilevel model (MLM) to explore the personality, social economic and strategy effects on health-related quality of life among PLWHIV 通用删除6(英):<u>[13,26]</u>. We set the individual-level as level-1 and the area-level as level-2. Based on the social economic models and strategy practice models by component analyses, we primarily examined the strategy effect as the area-level variables to predict HRQoL, with age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, occupation, household income per year, other know HIV status, initial infectious status, transmission model, duration of ART, the most recent CD4 counts, social support score, anxiety score and depression score as individual-level variables to predict the HRQoL. We adapted the random coefficient model to fit. Let yij be the score of HRQoL for individual i from area j. We used one individual-level and one area-level predictor to keep the notation simple and without loss of generality, indicated by xij and zj. Respectively. We listed the traditional single-level model as\nCasual heterogeneity was expressed by adding an interaction term, β3xijzj, to the model.\nFor the MLM, the individual-level model includes only individual-level predictors and its regression coefficients were not fixed but varied across areas and fitted into an area-level model.\nIndividual-level model: yij = β0j + β1jxij + εij.\nArea-level intercept model: β0j = β00 + β01zj + µ0j.\nArea-level slope model: β1j = β10 + β11zj + µ1j.\nThe area-level errors  and were assumed to be independent from the individual-level errors εij ~ N (0,σ2). Both the intercept and slope of the individual-level model were determined by the area-level variable. The main effect of area-level variables and the causal heterogeneity were determined by examining the intercept and slope of the individual-level model respectively.\nThe MLM divided the total variance of HRQoL into between-country (i.e. Σ) and within-country (i.e. σ2) variance.\nWe could also include multiple independent variables in the full MLM such as the multivariate models. In our study, the individual-level independent variables were age, race/ethnicity, education level, household income per year, recent CD4+ T counts, transmission model, duration of ART, social support, anxiety and depression. The area-level predictors in the study were social economic effect and strategy effect.\nWe used STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX) to perform all the statistical analysis.\nA total of 1997 respondents were enrolled in our study, with a mean age of 45.1 ± 11.8, ranging from 16 to 82. A total of 66.4% of respondents were of Han nationality, and others were from minority ethnic groups, e.g. Yi minority, Zhuang minority, Dai minority and Bai minority. A total of 58.5% of respondents reported themselves as divorced, unmarried and separated. A total of 71.1% of respondents had less than nine years of education. A total of 40.3% of respondents worked as farmers. The average income per capita of respondents’ households was CNY 11 600 in 2020. Regarding their HIV-related characteristics, 70.5% of respondents were in the HIV stage, 28.2% of respondents were in the AIDS stage when they were first diagnosed. A total of 70.2% of samples were those patients with heterosexual transmission, and 18.2% of respondents reported that they had a history of intravenous drug use (IDU). A total of 98.8% of respondents had maintained ART, among those, 58.9% had been treated for more than four years. A total of 71.3% of respondents had high CD4 cell counts (≥ 350 cells/μl) and 50.0% of respondents had CD4 cell counts greater than 500 cells/μl. More details are shown in Table 2.\nThe characteristics of our study sample\n删除重复语句：<u>The characteristics of our study sample</u>\nThe global quality of life score measured using EQ-5D-5L ranged from -0.391 to 1.000, with an estimated mean score (SD) of 0.901 ± 0.146. The median was 0.951 and the IQR was 0.107. The HRQoL score measured using PCS-12 ranged from 22.63 to 62.31, with an estimated mean score (SD) of 46.62 ± 8.55. The median was 48.22 and the IQR was 12.80. The MCS-12 ranged from 9.70 to 62.66, with an estimated mean score (SD) of 47.80 ± 9.71. The median was 48.19 and the IQR was 13.76. Significant differences in the EQ-5D-5L index score, PCS-12 and MCS-12 were found between age groups (P < 0.001), race/ethnicity groups (P < 0.05), occupation groups (P < 0.001), household income per year groups (P < 0.001), others know HIV status groups (P < 0.001), transmission model groups (P < 0.001) and duration of ART groups (P < 0.001). Significant differences in EQ-5D-5L index scores and PCS-12 scores were found between the most recent CD4 counts (P < 0.001) and initial infectious status groups (P < 0.05). More details are shown in Table 3.\nHealth-related quality of life for different variables include in our study\n删除重复语句：<u>Health-related quality of life for different variables include in our study</u>\n*P < 0.001, **P < 0.05. EQ-5D-5L EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire\nWe adopted principal component analysis to shape the different effects of the ten areas in our study. For the social economic effect, the component analysis showed that the initial eigenvalues of the first and second components were 2.43 and 1.73 respectively, which explained 83.3% of the variance.\nUsing standardization, we constructed the social economic effect, as shown in Fig. 1. We considered that the ten areas formed the ten kinds of social economic models.\nFor the strategy practice effect, the component analysis showed that the initial eigenvalues of the first and second components were 2.38 and 1.41 respectively, which explained 75.8% of variance. When we added the third component, the total variance of 92.1% could be explained, but it is hard to explain the different models of the strategy effect. Thus, we kept the first and second component.\nUsing standardization, we constructed the strategy effect, as shown in Fig. 2. We considered that the ten areas formed four kinds of strategy practice models.\nBased on the nesting of individual scores into the areas, we began our MLM analyses with the construction of the zero two-level model (area-individual) for HRQoL index score, PCS-12 and MCS-12 to investigate the variance among different areas. We found that the variance for HRQoL index score, PCS-12 and MCS-12 on the area level demonstrated the normal distribution N(0, 0.003), N(0, 12.7) and N(0, 15.1). The variance for all three scores at the area level showed the significant differences (P < 0.001). The variance partition coefficients (VPCs) of the HRQoL index score, PCS-12 and MCS-12 were 13.6%, 17.2% and 15.8% respectively. Table 4 shows the partition of variance based on the MLM.\nThe partition of variance of Health-related Quality of Life in the MLM analysis\n删除重复语句：<u>The partition of variance of Health-related Quality of Life in the MLM analysis</u>\nMLM multi-level model, HRQoL health-related quality of life, PCS physical functional scores, MCS mental functional scores, VPCs variance partition coefficients\nRegarding the area effect, a significant difference in global HRQoL measured using the EQ-5D-5L index score was found between strategy 1 and strategy 2 (Z= 2.14, P < 0.05). A significant difference in the mental component of HRQoL measured using the PCS-12 was found between strategy 1 and strategy 3 (Z = - 3.23, P < 0.001).\nRegarding individual effects, all the physical component and mental component of the HRQoL measured using PCS-12 and MCS-12 were significantly lower for the group with household income per year less than CNY 5000 compared to the group with household income per year more than CNY 10 000 (P < 0.05). A significant difference in global HRQoL measured using EQ-5D-5L was also demonstrated in the variables of all individuals with known HIV status, and unclear if HIV status is known compared to no one knowing the infectious status (P < 0.01). A significant difference was found in the physical component of HRQoL measured using PCS-12 between partial known HIV status, all known HIV status and unclear if HIV status is known compared to no one knowing the infectious status (P < 0.05). We also found a significant difference between those with known HIV status and those without known HIV status (P < 0.01). A significant difference also existed in the variables of anxiety score and depression score (P < 0.05). It was demonstrated that the global HRQoL scores increased to 0.010 by decreasing of anxiety scores to 1 and that the global HRQoL scores increased to 0.003 by the decreasing depression scores to 1. These significant differences were also found in the physical component and mental component of the HRQoL measured using PCS-12 and MCS-12 (P < 0.05). Otherwise, the social support score contributed positively to predicting the PCS-12 and MCS-12 (P < 0.001).\nOthers, both the physical component and mental component of the HRQoL measured using PCS-12 and MCS-12 were significantly lower for the intravenous drug user group than for the heterosexual transmission group (P < 0.05). The physical component of the HRQoL measured using PCS-12 was significantly lower for the group with recent CD4 counts of less than 200 cell/μl compared to the group with recent CD4 counts of more than 500 cell/μl (P < 0.05).\nTable 5, Table 6 and Table 7 show the details of the predictors at the area-level and individual-level associated with HRQoL, PCS-12 and MCS-12 .\nPredictors associated with health-related quality of life of PLWHIV\n删除重复语句：<u>Predictors associated with health-related quality of life of PLWHIV</u>\n*P < 0.05.

PLWHIV people living with HIV\nWe calculated the interaction coefficients of the area-level predictor and selected individual-level predictors. The interaction effect is demonstrated between the individual-level variable of anxiety and the area-level variable of strategy practice regardless of global HRQoL or PCS-12 and MCS-12 scores (P < 0.001) . We also considered the plots to visualize the effects of HRQoL, PCS-12 and MCS-12 scores from selected individual-level predictors modified by area-level effects. Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 indicate that the variability within and among areas existed in the selected area-level predictor of strategy and in the selected individual-level predictors of other-known-HIV status, transmission model, recent CD4 counts, social support, anxiety and depression. This finding demonstrated that the effects of these variables on HRQoL were different among different areas.\nCurrently, the HRQoL of PLWHIV has approached a high level, with a mean index score greater than 0.9 measured using the EQ-5D-5L in Yunnan province. However, it is still necessary to explore the predictors associated with HRQoL based on the diversity within and among areas and individuals. Our study applied MLM as an advanced statistical analytical tool to qualify the effect of area-level social economic and prevention strategies and the effect of individual-level variables on the HRQoL of PLWHIV in the era of the fourth 90% target for HIV/AIDS. First, we applied component analyses to classify the social economic model and prevention strategy model for the ten municipalities in Yunnan province. Finally, ten kinds of social economic models were formed based on the GDP per capita, employment rate, birth rate, mortality rate and natural growth rate. By the MLM, we found an area-level effect in ten municipalities on HRQoL, and it was considered that the social economic development status might inform the independent effect on HRQoL, especially on the psychological component of HRQoL. These results were found to be in accordance with one study conducted in China to explore the effect of area deprivation on adult depressive symptoms, which found that area deprivation has an independent contextual effect. Otherwise, the area-level prevention strategy also configured four kinds of models based on the indicators of the epidemic surveillance score, the comprehensive score of female sex workers intervention, the comprehensive score of men who have sex with men intervention, the comprehensive score of PLWHIV management and follow-up and the score of HIV laboratory testing quality. We considered that Kunming, Yuxi and Honghe municipalities informed a strategy that had a good quality to practice the prevention strategy. Dehong municipality kept a strategy practice model of demonstrative plots 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. Two other kinds of strategy practice models, consisting of Zhaotong, Lijiang, and Puer as well as Wenshan, Lincang, and Dali could be considered general strategy models. In our study, we found that the effect of the second and third strategy models (the Zhaotong, Lijiang, and Puer strategy model as well as the Wenshan, Lincang, and Dali strategy model) on HRQoL and the psychological component of HRQoL decreased compared to the first strategy model (the Kunming, Yuxi and Honghe model). The prevention strategy generally contained early testing and counseling as well as supplying timely and free ART and humanistic care. A good quality of strategy practice could form a good quality prevention system.\nStigma is a traditional predictor in the HIV/AIDS prevention field 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>, and can negatively influence happiness, self-esteem, sexual and social relationships and the sense of purpose in PLWHIV 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Our study found that whether others know the HIV infectious status has a primary individual-level effect on HRQoL and both the physical component and mental component. An infectious status that some or all of one’s friends orrelatives know could more or less lead to stigma and discrimination so that for a group whose HIV infectious status is open to others demonstrates worse HRQoL. Previous research has shown that HIV-related stigma and discrimination were strongly associated with self-assessed overall HRQoL, especially mental wellbeing 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It could also be an obstacle inhabiting the factors to prevent health-seeking behaviour and timely diagnosis. Therefore, one study was conducted to assess the effect of stigma on HRQoL to develop stigma reduction interventions for PLWHIV 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. One study implemented in children living with HIV/AIDS found that disclosure concerns would be a relevant target for interventions to decrease stigma and improve HRQoL 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>.\nSocial support, anxiety and depression are considered social-psychological characteristics associated with HRQoL 通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u>. In our study, social support was an individual effect that was positively correlated with the physical and psychological components of HRQoL. Many previous studies have proven the mediation effect to predict the HRQoL of PLWHIV 通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33]</u>. Good social support has been shown to be a protective resource for improved HRQoL, which was associated with better health outcomes in PLWHIV. Anxiety and depression are the two main mental health metrics that coexist with chronic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. Our study also showed a negative correlation between depression and anxiety as individual-level effects with HRQoL. Individuals with more serious depression and anxiety symptoms often have worse HRQoL. HRQoL suggests that at least two factors are required 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>, one factor assesses physical and functional limitations to be considered as a measure of physical QoL, and the other factor reflects the impact of health on the psychological state to be thought of as a measure of psychological QoL. Generally, psychological influences on HRQoL were considered to be long and powerful when people reported how they felt. Otherwise, the mediation effect among depression, anxiety, social support and HRQoL makes it necessary to advance humanistic care and poverty relief for PLWHIV.\nOther the individuals with a higher household income per year contribute to improved physical and mental components of HRQoL, which is consistent with some previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It is not surprising that PLWHIV who had a low income often reported a low HRQoL. There could be a relationship between income and social-economic status, which could facilitate social integration for a better opportunity for health protection and promotion. Our study demonstrated that recent low CD4 counts predicted a poor physical component of HRQoL, the same result found in other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. This finding emphasizes the importance of timely and effective ART.\nThe MLM analysis had the greatest advantage of having the ability to fit both the area and individual levels, according to the structure of the data measurement. The main objective of our study was to identify the social-economic and strategy effects at the area-level with impacts on individual HRQoL and quantify the impact. Although predicting HRQoL has some difficulties in obtaining stable perceived measurements, we check the goodness-of-fit using a proportion of between-area variation explained by the country-level predictors. Another advantage of MLMs is that they allow different individual models in different areas. We could examine the initial casual heterogeneity by the relationship between slopes of individual-level effects and area-level variables directly. Therefore, we could determine whether the impact of individual-level factors on a respondent’s HRQoL was modified by some area-level characteristics.\nSeveral limitations were noted in our study. First, adequate area-level variables were hard to acquire; therefore, there were some difficulties in configuring accurate models for social economic and prevention strategies. Second, the effects inhabited in the variables to predict HRQoL were complicated, such as the direct, indirect and mediated effects. Our study did not clarify these relationships. Third, our study did not emphasize more on the variance explanation for the different levels. Fourth, our study did not use a professional measurement scale to define the stigma for PLWHIV. We adopted a variable of whether the HIV status known by others to measure the possible stigma.\nOur study identified the area effect on individual HRQoL of PLWHIV and demonstrated the impact of the stigma, social support, anxiety, depression and social economic status on the HRQoL in the individual-level. The impact of the individual-level factors on a respondent’s HRQoL may be modified by the area-level characteristics to some extents. Our study demonstrated a model combined of area-level social-economic and prevention strategy practice and individual effect on the HRQoL, which could be a valuable resource for evaluating the overall health of the areas and help improve local decision making.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The obvious advantage of SMIS is to cure diseases without damaging the structure and function of organs. For cancer patients, it can ensure a normal survival time and postoperative quality of life (QoL).通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Nevertheless, high-quality comparative studies between SMIS and esophagectomy in the treatment of superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SESCC) are lacking. Hence, the present study mainly aimed to compare the outcomes of SMIS and esophagectomy directly, especially in terms of QoL and lifestyle.\nWe reviewed patients who were hospitalized in Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital with SESCC from January 2018 to June 2020 and received SMIS or esophagectomy. The diagnosis of SESCC is based on postoperative pathological results. The following exclusion criteria were employed: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging does not satisfy T1N0M0; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> other previous treatments for the current disease (such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy); 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> second primary malignancy or previous other malignancy treatments. In the SMIS group, patients who underwent rescue esophagectomy immediately were excluded from the intention-to-treat analysis because this procedure goes beyond the scope of SMIS. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B250, 120 patients were included in the SMIS group and 62 patients were included in the esophagectomy group. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of PLA General Hospital 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. S2017-010-02)</u> and informed consent was received from each patient.\nBefore the procedure, all patients underwent gastroscopy and were evaluated by magnifying endoscopy/blue light laser/chromoendoscopy with Lugol solution/narrow-band imaging. In addition, endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and/or positron emission tomography-CT were used to determine the tumor boundary, depth of invasion, and lymph node metastasis. Based on the size of the tumor and the condition around the lesion, endoscopic submucosal dissection or endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection can be used in SMIS, and the specific steps were carried out as described previously.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Esophagectomy can be divided into open esophagectomy and minimally invasive esophagectomy according to whether thoracotomy was performed, and the procedures have been described in detail in the previous study.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\nThe primary outcomes were QoL and lifestyle changes during postoperative follow-up. The secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). QoL was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> And the degree of dysphagia and the change of sleep position were also highlighted during the follow-up. Dysphagia was divided into five levels according to the Mellow-Pinkas score.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> The change of sleep position was evaluated by whether the patient could sleep supine or not. The patients were scheduled for follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months after the operation, including tumor marker assessments, gastroscopy, and CT. Patients were also contacted to obtain the QLQ-C30 scores and lifestyle via interview at the clinic or via telephone.\nStatistical analyses were processed using the SPSS (IBM Statistics 25.0, USA). A comparison of categorical variables was performed using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were compared using Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. The survival analysis was used for the Kaplan-Meier method. And P values <0.05 (two-sided) were indicated statistical significance. To minimize selection bias, we used propensity score matching (PSM) to compare the outcomes between the SMIS and esophagectomy groups. PSM included ten factors that may influence treatment choice and treatment prognosis, including age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, tumor diameter, tumor location, differentiation grade, invasion depth, lymphovascular invasion, margin positivity, and follow-up period. The SMIS group and the esophagectomy group were matched at a ratio of 1:1, and the PSM caliper value was set to 0.01.\nThe baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B250. And the baseline characteristics of the 34 matched patient pairs were comparable after PSM. The mean follow-up period was 23.1 ± 8.8 months in the SMIS group and 23.8 ± 8.2 months in the esophagectomy group. No significant differences in overall mortality, disease-specific mortality, or recurrence and/or metastasis rates between the SMIS and esophagectomy groups were noted at the end of follow-up before and after PSM. In the matched cohort, the rate of additional therapy in the esophagectomy group was slightly lower (11.8%, 4/34), but no statistically significant difference was noted between the two groups (P = 0.072) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 2, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B250]</u>. Moreover, the SMIS group still belonged to the mode of organ preservation after additional therapy. As shown in Supplementary Figure 2, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B250, the 3-year DSS rates of the two groups before and after matching were 93.0% vs. 92.4% (P = 0.472) and 100% vs. 97.1% (P = 0.429), respectively. The 3-year RFS rates of the two groups before and after matching were 80.1% vs. 81.7% (P= 0.649) and 80.6% vs. 85.5% (P = 0.575), respectively.\nThe matched cohort QoL scores are shown in Supplementary Table 3, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B250. In propensity score-matched analysis with two groups, the global health status score and physical and social function scores of the functional scale in the SMIS group were significantly better than those in the esophagectomy group, with statistically significant differences (P = 0.002; P = 0.048; P = 0.005). The scores of fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and economic impact in the esophagectomy group were significantly higher than those in the SMIS group, and the differences were statistically significant (P= 0.024; P= 0.022; P = 0.030; P= 0.001). During the follow-up, we also asked the patients about lifestyle changes such as diet and sleep position. The median of Mellow-Pinkas score in the SMIS group and esophagectomy group were 0 通用删除7(英):<u>(0, 0)</u> and 0 通用删除7(英):<u>(0, 2)</u>, respectively, with the statistical difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). In the SMIS group, only one patient (1/34, 2.9%) could not be supine at night. In the esophagectomy group, 19 patients (55.9%) were unable to lie flat and needed to sleep by increasing the height of pillows or raising the head of the bed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 4, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B250]</u>.\nTo date, there are few comparative studies on endoscopic resection and esophagectomy in the treatment of SESCC. Although PSM was used, previous studies focused more on survival analysis. The SMIS ushered in a new stage of surgical treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> It is of great importance to compare the two modes, especially when the focus is no longer limited to the survival rate.\nIn the present study, we established strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and matched patients to ensure that there was no statistically difference in demographic characteristics and tumor characteristics among all patients. Under this premise, the outcomes of SMIS and esophagectomy in the treatment of SESCC were compared. The postoperative QoL at a mean follow-up of two years in the SMIS group was superior to that in the esophagectomy group according to retrospectively collected EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, especially in the aspects of social function, global health status, and financial impact. The huge trauma of esophagectomy leads to fatigue and impairment of physical function. Higher pain and sleep disturbance scores may be associated with a higher incidence of reflux. In the field of dysphagia, the severity of the esophagectomy group was higher than the SMIS group. Due to the small sample size, this result needs to be carefully interpreted. The mechanism may be that the integrity of the organ is preserved after SMIS, and only the elasticity of the esophageal wall is affected. Dysphagia is more caused by the decline in compliance. In the esophagectomy group, due to the reconstruction of anatomical integrity through the anastomosis of organs, dysphagia was mainly due to \"obstructive\" stenosis caused by fibrosis. In terms of sleep position, most patients in the esophagectomy group complained that they could not sleep supine at night, which caused great annoyance to the patients. In the SMIS group, the majority of patients could sleep supine. From the perspective of lifestyle, the effect of esophagectomy on diet and sleep was significantly better than that of SMIS. In conclusion, the QoL and lifestyle of patients in the SMIS group were significantly better than in the esophagectomy group. In addition, no significant differences in OS, DSS, or RFS were noted between the SMIS group and the esophagectomy group. It should be noted that this study is not only a comparison of specific surgical methods, but also a comparison of two surgical concepts.\nThere are several limitations of this study. The main limitation is the potential selection bias in the retrospective design of a single center; however, a prospective trial design is difficult to achieve due to ethical and other reasons. Second, it was difficult to obtain the precise depth of tumor in the esophagectomy group, especially for submucosal invasion. However, we used PSM to control bias. Third, the follow-up was relatively short and the size of cohort was relatively small. Next, we will also carry out esophageal manometry on the patients.\nTo conclude, the survival rates of SMIS and esophagectomy were comparable at the mid-term follow-up, whereas SMIS showed great advantages in terms of QoL and lifestyle. Further studies with longer follow-up time and larger samples are needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

In recent years, the omics field has advanced considerably due to developments in the high-throughput analysis of biological molecules. Transcriptomic technologies in particular have provided rich insights into cellular characteristics, and measure the complete set of RNA transcripts produced by the genome under specific circumstances. Indeed, characterizing the transcriptome of individual cells is fundamental to improve our understanding of complex biological systems. Over the last decade, the rapid development of single-cell sequencing technology has greatly accelerated biomedical research, allowing scientists to overcome the major challenge of heterogeneity within biological samples and leading to the publication of a series of single-cell transcriptome atlases.删除4：<u>2,3,4</u>\nHowever, most single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches involve isolating cells from their original position, meaning that spatial information is lost during transcriptome profiling. This omission makes it impossible to examine how a given cellular state interacts with neighboring cells or the surrounding extracellular matrix.2,5,6 To make up for this deficit, a new technology known as spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) aims to determine gene expression profiles while preserving information about the spatial context of the tissue. This technique is of great significance, since identifying the specific spatial location and organization of different cell types in multicellular tissues or organs is the foundation for research into cellular biological functions. Transcriptomics that is accompanied by spatial information will undoubtedly enable us to better understand the organization of cells and tissues, and how this organization influences biological function.7 The application of SRT has also opened up new areas of spatially resolved omics, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and potentially other omic data with retained positional information. The ability of SRT to change the way we understand complex tissues earned it the title of Method of the Year 2020 in Nature Methods.8 In this review, we will first summarize and compare the major methods of SRT , highlight some current applications of SRT, and finally discuss our perspectives on the potential future applications of this method.\nMajor SRT methods.\n删除重复语句：<u>Major SRT methods.</u>\ncorrFISH = correlation FISH, FFPE = formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded, FISH = fluorescence in situ hybridization, HDST = high-definition spatial transcriptomics, LCM = laser-capture microdissection, MERFISH = multiplexed error-robust FISH, scRNA-seq = single-cell RNA-sequencing, smFISH = single-molecule FISH, seqFISH = sequential barcoded FISH, SRM = super-resolution microscopy, ST = spatial transcriptomics, TIVA= transcriptome in vivo analysis, DBiT-seq =deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing, ExFISH=expansion microscopy of fluorescence in situ hybridization, FISSEQ=fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing, Geo-seq=geographical position sequencing, RCA= rolling circle amplification.\nThe core, underlying principle of SRT, involves the acquisition of gene expression profiles while retaining spatial information. Broadly speaking, SRT methods can be classified into 3 groups: imaging-based methods, sequencing-based methods, and in situ sequencing methods. Imaging-based methods are carried out using a microscope, and the transcriptomes are read out through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Sequencing-based methods are performed using next-generation sequencing technology, and RNA with spatial information is captured and subsequently sequenced. In situ sequencing methods are the combination of imaging- and sequencing-based methods. These methods have their intrinsic strengths and limitations, with differences in target coverage, resolution, and throughput. Like all methods, they must be appropriately matched to the biological question at hand.\nSpatial information about protein expression can be obtained from traditional immunohistochemistry (IHC) approaches, which are mediated by the specific binding reaction between antigens and antibodies. In a variation of the IHC method, spatial information about gene expression can be obtained by identifying the mRNA in cells using in situ hybridization (ISH), which involves a hybridization reaction between labeled nucleotide probes and complementary targeting RNA molecules. The single-molecule FISH (smFISH) method is the gold standard for detecting transcripts, and efforts to develop multiplex FISH at the transcriptome level are underway. This would allow FISH to answer more complex biological questions.\nsmFISH combines quantitative FISH with digital imaging microscopy to sensitively detect single RNA molecules using probes. To amplify the signals, probes are often labeled with multi-fluorochromes per molecule.9 However, the disadvantages, which include difficulty in acquiring heavily labeled oligonucleotides, the easy loss of coupling fluorophores and self-quenching, highly variable signals associated with multi-fluorophores limit the system to a narrow range of applications. To overcome these drawbacks, singly labeled probes, which are easier to generate and purify, were introduced to accurately detect individual mRNA molecules with uniform signals10,11 .\nsmFISH can not only visualize the transcripts in isolated cells or in situ tissues at a high resolution and with high hybridization efficiency, but also provides information about the distribution of subcellular RNA within cells. This feature means that extra analyses concerning subcellular mRNA localization and its functional stages can be achieved, as mRNA localization is currently believed to contribute to the localized regulation of gene expression.12,13,14,15 In addition, smFISH can precisely measure the copy numbers of specific RNAs without amplification bias and natural fluctuations in gene expression can be quantitatively measured, permitting the elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate gene expression fluctuations and their role in a variety of biological processes. These features make smFISH a robust tool, and it is the standard method used for detecting transcripts.\nMany biological questions require transcription information about multiple genes, so efforts have been made to address the challenge of the limited number of RNA species that be simultaneously detected in cells using FISH. Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) can resolve a large number of mRNAs in single cells by labeling mRNAs with unique combinations of fluorophores. Although this expanded the scalability of FISH from a few genes to about 30, it was hard to make further progress due to the limited number of fluorophores.16 Later, a sequential barcoding scheme was introduced to multiplex different mRNAs, called sequential barcoded FISH (seqFISH).17 Here, the mRNA is barcoded by sequential rounds of hybridization, imaging, and probe stripping. The number of RNA species scales as FN, where F is the number of fluorophores and N is the number of rounds of hybridization. Thus, the scalability of seqFISH can be dramatically improved by increasing the number of rounds of hybridization, despite the limited number of fluorophores. In this manner, the entire human transcriptome can be covered, including both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs . However, N rounds of hybridizations bring not only exponentially increased throughput, but also exponentially increased detection error rates. When N increases, the error rates increase rapidly, and the majority of RNA molecules are likely to be misidentified after 16 rounds of hybridization.18 Therefore, multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH) method was designed. MERFISH is based on combinatorial labeling and sequential imaging, and uses error-robust encoding schemes to correct labeling and detection errors. The method introduces a certain Hamming distance to encode RNAs, and the minimum Hamming distance is 4 (HD4 code), meaning that at least 4 bits must be read incorrectly to change one codeword into another. As a result, every single-bit error produces a word that is uniquely close to a single codeword, allowing such errors to be detected and corrected. In addition, MERFISH improves the multiplexity of transcripts that can be obtained in single cells to 100 to 1000 through the use of binary sequential barcodes19,20 .\nAlthough seqFISH makes scaling to the level of the genome theoretically possible, transcriptome-level profiling in cells is hindered by optical crowding due to the high density of global transcripts, even when combined with SRM. Some progress has been made to improve the resolution of microscopy, with expansion microscopy (ExM) using a swellable polyelectrolyte gel that can expand physically to magnify the sample. RNAs are covalently attached to the gel, a small molecule linker, and FISH (ExFISH) is performed in cultured cells and intact tissues with high yield and specificity.21 Another approach called correlation FISH (corrFISH) was used in seqFISH to read out individual RNA species and barcodes. The principle is simple: RNA species are decoded such that each RNA species appears in only 2 out of a total of 3 rounds of hybridization. By cross-correlating the images from the 2 rounds of hybridization, only the specific RNA species will generate a positive correlation. Although some algorithms have been adapted due to the need for a high degree of temporal resolution, corrFISH still represents a robust method to decode high copy number RNAs in highly multiplexed seqFISH experiments, using conventional fluorescence microscopy.删除4：<u>22</u>\nAnother way to address the issue of molecular crowding is to dilute the density of the mRNA. Thus, seqFISH+ labels the secondary probes with fluorophores rather than the primary probes, which provide target sites for the secondary probes. The primary probes divide the transcript set into 20 subsets, and the secondary probes, which are labeled with three colors, ultimately make it possible to visualize one-sixtieth of the transcripts per image in each round of hybridization . seqFISH+ achieves transcriptome-level profiling not only for cultured cells but also in tissues, so that unbiased identification of cells alongside their spatial organization can be realized.删除4：<u>23</u>\nWith the development of genetic techniques, next-generation sequencing technology has become a powerful tool for transcriptome analysis. scRNA-seq can precisely characterize cell types and states at the molecular level, without bias, based on global gene expression profiles.24 Generally speaking, sequencing-based methods are performed to capture or barcode the RNA before reverse transcription to ensure each transcript can be mapped to its original spatial spot, or are used to gain gene expression information from cells in a certain spatial context. RNA-seq can be conducted either ex situ or in situ.\nSome methods do not provide the spatial resolution of microscopy-based techniques as they do not predict or validate cell types using IHC or ISH. Examples of such methods include tomo-seq and Slide-seq.25,26 Tomo-seq is a serial microtomy-based sequencing method, which cryosections the tissue of interest and performs RNA-seq on individual thin sections . RNA extraction is performed for each individual section and the RNA is barcoded with section-specific primers. This approach can provide genome-wide RNA tomography of tissues or organs, but it is often only possible to cryosection tissue in 1 direction, resulting in 1-dimensional data along 1 axis of the body. For this reason, tomo-seq is best suited for elongated samples. Cells with complex organizations in the same individual sections cannot be analyzed well, and often several identical samples are required to perform cryosectioning in different directions along the main body axes to achieve 2- and 3-dimensional resolution.删除4：<u>27</u>\nUnlike tomo-seq, Slide-seq is a method for transferring RNA from tissue sections onto a surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the locations of the RNA to be inferred by sequencing. It provides a scalable method for obtaining spatially resolved gene expression data at resolutions comparable to the sizes of individual cells.26 Slide-seqV2 is an optimized version of Slide-seq with improvements in library generation, bead synthesis, and array indexing to reach an RNA capture efficiency ~10-fold greater than Slide-seq.28 A new method, called sci-Space, adapts the low-cost sci-Plex procedure for labeling or \"hashing\" cell nuclei using unmodified DNA oligos to glass slides. The hashed oligos spotted onto the glass slides are transferred onto permeabilized nuclei (not intact cells) in freshly frozen tissue sections. As the nuclei are stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and the spatial coordinates are consequently imaged during oligo transfer, sci-Space can retain a single-cell resolution.29 Obviously, the main limitation of all these methods is that the cell types are purely identified by RNA-seq datasets, which lacks the cell-validation process that microscopy-based techniques provide.\nAlthough single-cell RNA-seq has the power to define cell types or populations based on gene expression programs, microscopy-based techniques such as IHC or ISH—which validate candidate genes with high cell type specificity—remain the gold standard to define cell type. Thus, a series of sequencing-based methods combined with imaging have been developed to aid the study of solid cell types.\nLaser-capture microdissection (LCM) is an optional method to obtain targeted cell subgroups or even single cells quickly and precisely under the microscope. LCM directly harvests cells of interest or isolates specific cells by cutting away unwanted cells via infrared capture systems or ultraviolet cutting systems30 . Histological staining or rapid antibody staining are performed on the tissues before LCM so that information about the types of cells captured is validated. The key advantages of LCM are that the positional information of cells is maintained and tissues are not dissected; in this way, subsequent analysis by genomics, transcriptomics, or proteomics can be performed on the LCM-captured cells.31,32,33 The extracted nucleic acids can be amplified when the captured regions of interest are small, overcoming the requirement for relatively large numbers of cells. This advantage makes it possible to use LCM at the single-cell level, meaning that it is especially useful for scarce tissues and rare cell types. Geo-seq is the combination of LCM and scRNA-seq technology.33 It is also practical to combine LCM with Smart-seq2, a high-throughput scRNA-seq technology with improved sensitivity, accuracy, and full-length coverage across transcripts, making LCM plus Smart-seq2 a promising prospect for SRT.31,34,35 However, the main obstacles to the wide application of LCM SRT are its low throughput and potential RNA contamination from other cells, as well as the inevitable damage to adjacent tissue. This means that it is difficult to study the interplay between individual cells and the microenvironment.\nOne method with similarities to LCM coupled with Smart-seq2 is NICHE-seq, which couples with scRNA-seq. This technique combines photoactivatable fluorescent markers, 2-photon laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and is coupled to massively parallel scRNA-seq . NICHE-seq requires transgenic mice that ubiquitously express a photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PA-GFP). Two-photon irradiation is used to activate PA-GFP and in situ labeling. After tissue dissociation, GFP-labeled cells can be sorted to perform scRNA-seq; thus, this method combines information about the cell’s transcriptional state and spatial information.36 As this method requires transgenic mice expressing GFP, however, it is not suitable for clinical samples.\nAnother method based on barcoded glass slides, called spatial transcriptomics (ST), also validates cell types by histological staining and imaging.37 RNA is spatially captured from tissue sections and barcoded via a microarray on a glass slide. Several primers with unique barcodes are placed on the microscopic glass slide to create a microarray, and a section of tissue is placed on top of the microarray surface. This tissue is then fixed, then stained and imaged, before being permeabilized to release RNA within the cells. In this way, transcripts from the tissue are allowed to meet with the immobilized cDNA synthesis primers in a reverse transcription reaction. Consequently, the cDNA library is sequenced and the data are visualized together with a high-resolution histological image of the tissue section. Each slide consists of about 1000 spots, and ST is both easy to perform and requires no special instruments. The method has been acquired and optimized by 10x Genomics and a commercial kit is available .\nDBiT-seq is a microfluidic-based method that delivers barcodes to the surface of a tissue slide to allow for spatial omic sequencing. This method enables the co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins on a slide containing formaldehyde-fixed tissue38 . Immunofluorescence can be performed on the same tissue slide, so that proteomics can be integrated with transcriptomics. The capacity for integration is of great significance for multi-omics research.\nCurrent methods that capture RNA, such as LCM, cannot isolate mRNA from individual in vivo cells without damaging adjacent tissue, making it difficult to assess the influence of the microenvironment on the transcriptome. To overcome this problem, a method was engineered to extract mRNA from live cells or tissues at the spatial resolution of a single cell. This method is called transcriptome in vivo analysis (TIVA); it uses a photoactivatable biotinylated tag, known as a TIVA-tag, that can penetrate the cell membrane by virtue of a cell-penetrating peptide. Once inside the cell, photoactivation is used to cleave the linkers between the poly(U) sequence and two poly(A) stretches to enable the poly(U) sequence to bind the poly-A tail of mRNAs . With this method, mRNA can be noninvasively captured within live cells and intact tissues, so it provides a useful tool to explore the transcriptomes of single cells in the context of their natural microenvironment. However, the method is low throughput with regard to the numbers of cells that can be analyzed.\nSolid RNA-barcoding is favorable in terms of its untargeted features and high coverage compared with imaging-based methods. Efforts have been made to improve the spatial resolution and capture area of this method, as a higher resolution means the precise location of the transcripts within the tissues, cells or even subcellular organelles can be determined.\nST can achieve a resolution of only 100 μm (which is not at the single-cell level), which means that the 100 μm spatial spots, with a center-to-center distance of 200 μm, typically cover 5 to 100 cells each, depending on tissue type and region.37 Visium technology from 10X Genomics has improved the ST method by reducing the diameter of the capture area from 100 to 55 μm, increasing the capture area to 42.25 mm2 (6.5 mm × 6.5 mm), and decreasing workflow duration . Nevertheless, the spatial resolution of 10X Genomics’ Visium is still insufficient to resolve single cells in most samples.\nSlide-seq and DBiT-seq both have improved spatial resolution to 10 μm,26,38 but this is still a near-cellular resolution and cannot be described as single-cell resolution. High-definition spatial transcriptomics (HDST), an optimized version of ST, was designed to improve ST resolution to the single-cell level. In this method, hundreds of thousands of barcodes are randomly deposited onto a slide at 2 μm resolution, and their positions are decoded by sequential hybridization and error-correcting strategy.39 One method, called spatiotemporal enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-Seq), involves the deposition of a DNA nanoball containing random barcoded sequences to form the chip. Each spot is approximately 220 nm in diameter, with a center-to-center distance of 500 nm.40 Another method, known as Seq-Scope, has a center-to-center resolution of 0.5 to 0.8 μm (0.6 μm on average).41 The nano-level distances of these methods are far less than the diameter of single cells, giving them the high resolution needed to determine the subcellular location of transcripts.\nThe combination of imaging and sequencing processes typically involves in situ sequencing methods. In situ sequencing methods sequence cDNA amplicons based on padlock probes and rolling circle amplification.42,43 The 2 ends of the padlock probe can be ligated to form a circle-like structure upon hybridization, which then can be amplified using an isothermal DNA polymerase. Amplification causes copies of the padlock probe sequence to accumulate and form cDNA nanoballs. An amplified signal can be obtained by visualizing the cDNA nanoballs using fluorescently labeled detection oligonucleotides, which are complementary to the padlock probe.\nFISSEQ, a highly multiplexed subcellular in situ RNA sequencing method, uses random hexamer-primed reverse transcription in the presence of aminoallyl dUTP. Aminoallyl dUTP then fixes the cDNA fragments to the cellular protein matrix by a non-reversible amine cross-linker.44 The templates are circularized after degrading the RNA, and subsequently amplified using rolling circle amplification primers complementary to the adapter sequence introduced by RT. The amplicons in the cells are then ready for sequencing-by-ligation (SOLiD sequencing) at room temperature, and imaging on a confocal microscope. To control the signal density of FISSEQ, a partition sequencing strategy was devised using pre-extended sequencing primers.44,45 With 1 base extended, one can randomly sample amplicons at 1/4th of the original density, and with 2 bases extended sampling at 1/16th of the density is possible. One notable highlight of FISSEQ is that it preserves the tissue architecture for RNA localization studies, and localizes subcellular RNA transcriptome-wide. However, the random priming component is inefficient and may introduce bias via uneven binding efficiency, which is due to differences in base composition.\nWhile SRT can be performed on tissues or sections on a slide, applying in situ sequencing methods to 3-dimensional volumes of intact tissue is not easy. To achieve this goal, a method known as spatially resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping (STARmap) integrates hydrogel-tissue chemistry, targeted signal amplification and in situ sequencing.46 The method bypasses the reverse transcription step and uses the SNAIL approach instead, which achieves specific amplification of nucleic acids via intra-molecular ligation using a pair of custom primer and padlock probes. Only when both probes hybridize to the same RNA molecule can the padlock probe be circularized and rolling-circle-amplified to generate a DNA nanoball. The cDNA amplicons are modified and copolymerized in situ to embed within a hydrogel network. In situ SEDAL sequencing was devised specifically for STARmap, to sequence 5-base barcoded gene-specific identifier segments in SNAIL probes over 6 rounds of hybridization . The highlight of STARmap lies in its ability to be used in 3-dimensional in situ transcriptomics, which is undoubtedly a state-of-the-art SRT technique and serves to deepen our understanding of anatomy and transcriptomics. In parallel, there is no intrinsic limit to the number of genes or RNA species that can be simultaneously and quantitatively accessed with STARmap, since it can be adapted to longer sequencing lengths or higher gene numbers.\nIn conclusion, ISH is highly sensitive, and can detect transcripts at a subcellular resolution. Many powerful strategies have been designed to improve the target coverage of ISH to the transcriptome level and tackle the problem of optical crowding. However, such methods are typically limited by long image acquisition times and a complex probe-designing process. While next-generation sequencing technology enables high-throughput transcriptomic profiling, many sequencing-based methods are much easier to perform once suitable experimental platforms have been established. As spatially barcoded beads or spots can be arrayed more and more densely, some solid-barcoded methods can reach a cellular or subcellular resolution, and spatial information is more precisely retained. To some extent, in situ sequencing methods are a combination of imaging- and sequencing-based methods, sequencing gene identifiers in the designed primers via FISH. Although in situ sequencing methods are high throughput, the complexity of designing targeted probes cannot be ignored .\nMost of the in situ-based methods described above rely on the use of fresh tissues. However, fresh clinical material is often difficult to obtain for research purposes. To remove the barriers to clinical research, some methods have been designed to use formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, in which the RNA is degraded. Smart-3SEQ enables large gene expression profiling experiments to be conducted on even small amounts of total RNA, and effectively characterizes small samples extracted by LCM from FFPE tissue.47 In addition, 10X Genomics markets a commercially available system, called Visium FFPE, that enables SRT to be performed on samples from a biobank. Some studies have already successfully used 10x Visium FFPE on FFPE tissue.删除4：<u>48</u>\nThe additional dimension of spatial information brings not only a novel perspective on the transcriptome, but also significant challenges for data analysis due to increased data volume and complexity. Generally speaking, strategies for SRT data analysis include computational approaches specifically designed for SRT and integration methods (with bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data). Different analytical approaches have been developed for localized gene expression pattern identification, spatial decomposition, gene imputation, and cell-cell communication.删除4：<u>49</u>\nGene expression and spatial location are both of great relevance to biological functions. By analyzing the relationship between gene expression and spatial location, some approaches, including Trendsceek,50 SpatialDE,51 SPARK,52 SPARK-X,53 sepal,54 SpaGCN,55 and GLISS, are designed to identify localized gene expression patterns and spatially variable genes (SVGs) based on different algorithms. Another way to discover SVGs is spatial clustering. Unlike standard clustering methods for scRNA-seq, spatial clustering is for the capture locations. Methods like stLearn, MULTILAYER,56 BayesSpace,57 SC-MEB,58 and STAGATE can be applied for spatial clustering. As most of the sequencing-based methods do not guarantee that a single capture spot contains RNA from only 1 cell, a capture location is often a mixture of multiple cell types. Thus, some spatial decomposition algorithms, such as NNLS, spatialDWLS,59 SPOTlight,60 RCTD,61 DSTG, Tangram, and Cell2location attempt to infer the proportions of cell types in each spot, or score a spot for how strongly it corresponds to a single cellular subtype based on bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data. However, certain SRT methods, particularly those that are imaging-based, cannot provide deep transcriptomic information due to limited gene coverage. Gene imputation provides a chance to impute the missing genes from scRNA-seq data in order to improve the quality of SRT data. Methods that include gene imputation functions include Tangram,62 gimVI, Harmony,63 LIGER,64 Seurat,65 SpaGE,66 and stPlus.67 In addition, the reconstruction of spatial information for scRNA-seq data can be achieved by mapping, which leverages a small set of landmark genes to map the single cell back to its context. Methods that incorporate a mapping function include Harmony, LIGER, Seurat, SpaGE, DEEPsc,68 DistMap, SpaOTsc,69 novoSpaRc,70 and CSOmap.71 In addition, cell-cell interactions can be analyzed using some standard algorithms, based on the ligand-receptor interaction pairs from scRNA-seq data and a database of known ligand-receptor interactions. However, the loss of spatial information in scRNA-seq data may lead to inaccurate detection of ligand-receptor interactions, as cellular cross-talk is often spatially restricted. Therefore, SRT data might potentially evaluate the reliability of the ligand-receptor interactions computed from scRNA-seq. In this manner, integrating scRNA-seq with SRT data may accurately reveal specific cell subpopulations and their interactions. Approaches to study cell-cell interactions include SVCA,72 GCNG, NCEM, MISTy, stLearn, Squidpy, novoSpaRc, SpaOTsc, and DEEPsc. Among these methods, comprehensive benchmark studies are needed to help users select methods that best fit their data and hypotheses. According to a study benchmarking 16 integration methods, Tangram, gimVI, and SpaGE outperformed other integration methods when predicting the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts, while Cell2location,73 SpatialDWLS, and RCTD were the top-performing methods for the cell type deconvolution of spots.删除4：<u>74</u>\nIn conclusion, SRT and scRNA-seq data complement each other, since SRT methods cannot always maintain single-cell resolution with the same depth and whole transcriptome coverage of scRNA-seq. The integration of scRNA-seq and SRT data could improve cell type annotation, cell clustering, spatial decomposition, gene imputation, and spatial location reconstruction. A scRNA-seq database could form a solid foundation for SRT data analysis. However, the proper handling of spatial information obtained from SRT data remains a challenge in terms of data processing, and the establishment of proper protocols will be an essential step to reach the full potential of these methods.\nAt present, SRT technologies are widely utilized in basic and clinical research, especially in neuroscience, cancer biology, and developmental biology. However, there are likely further applications for SRT that are yet to be fully utilized, including in the study of hematopoeisis. We reviewed the potential applications in this field in Figure 4.\nThe diversity of brain cell types and the complex organization of the brain have long been major challenges to our understanding of brain functions during physiological and pathological conditions.75 A census of brain cell types and their functions will pave the way for systematic research and, potentially, even novel clinical treatments. SRT has advantages over scRNA-seq due to the retained anatomical and spatial contexts, and various spatially resolved transcriptomic methods have been applied to map cell types in neuroscience. For example, an atlas of the mouse somatosensory cortex was built using osmFISH, a semiautomated version of smFISH. Based on scRNA-seq data, the study identified 31 clusters of cell types and 33 cell type-specific marker genes.76 Although multiplexing in osmFISH is relatively low, its sensitivity is higher than scRNA-seq and can provide single-cell-level spatial resolution for gene detection. Multiplexed FISH techniques, such as MERFISH and seqFISH, are applied when more genes need to be analyzed. The multiplexing of 250 genes using seqFISH identified distinct subregions of the hippocampus that contained different combinations of cell types.18 In addition, MERFISH combined with measurements of immediate early gene expression identified ~70 neuronal populations in the mouse hypothalamic preoptic area, and defined discrete cell populations activated by specific social behaviors.77 STARmap has also been used to reconstruct the 3D locations of cells in the murine primary visual cortex and medial prefrontal cortex; in this particular study, >1000 genes were simultaneously mapped in mouse brain sections at a single-cell resolution.46 Sequencing-based methods such as Slide-seq and 10X Genomics’ Visium have also been used to analyze the global transcriptome in both the mouse and human brain.删除4：<u>26,37</u>\nThe application of spatially resolved transcriptomic methods is highly likely to improve our understanding of neurological diseases. For example, SRT has already revealed the spatiotemporal dynamics of molecular pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.78 Furthermore, in a murine model of Alzheimer disease, ST and in situ sequencing were used to better characterize the dysregulated cellular network in the early and late phases of disease. The results of this study provided profound insights into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, and also provided clues concerning potential therapeutic targets.删除4：<u>79</u>\nHeterogeneity both within and between tumors is found in most types of cancer.80,81 The expansion of tumor subclones with varying genetic alterations and the interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment presents a complicated situation that influences disease development.82 Profiling the spatial heterogeneity of tumors and the tumor microenvironment will provide insights into tumor progression and responses to treatment, and will therefore assist in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition. ST technology has been used to identify intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity in multiple types of cancer. Furthermore, changes in gene expression during prostate cancer and cutaneous malignant melanoma progression have revealed a detailed landscape of tumor progression and metastases.83,84 Several features of the tumor microenvironment in primary liver cancer, including stromal and immune cell distribution, tumor cluster interaction, cancer stem cell-niche diversity and tertiary lymphoid structure composition have been characterized.85 Coupling SRT with other technologies also improves its capacity to characterize tumors: for example, when SRT was combined with scRNA-seq, tissue architecture and interactions between cell subpopulations were revealed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.86 A tumor-specific keratinocyte population, immune infiltrates, and heterogeneity at tumor leading edges have also been identified in human squamous cell carcinoma using multimodal analysis, which included scRNA-seq and ST.87 The heterogeneity of breast cancer has also been characterized, and several diagnostic and prognostic markers proposed.88,89 Additionally, by integrating spatial gene expression and HE-stained images of breast tumor, a deep learning algorithm was developed to predict the spatially resolved transcriptome of a tissue from the images, enabling image-based screening for molecular biomarkers.90 To guide clinical treatment, biomarkers associated with beneficial PD-1 checkpoint blockade in non-small-cell lung cancer were identified using digital spatial profiling.91 The ST analysis of human bladder cancer also identified an N-Cadherin 2-expressing epithelial cell subpopulation which could be used to predict therapeutic response, which could guide treatment decisions.92 In conclusion, these findings provide novel insights into the complex ecosystem of cancer. and have the potential to improve individualized cancer treatments and drug discovery.\nEmbryonic development is a complex process where dynamic changes rapidly occur at the biomolecular level.93,94 Lineage tracing and fate mapping are powerful tools in developmental biology, providing a picture of the lineage hierarchy and linking the initial cell position to future fate.95 With the emergence of SRT, analysis of both the temporal and spatial aspects of embryonic development can be performed, and a temporal and spatial expression blueprint is eagerly anticipated. In the early embryo, gastrulation is an essential developmental event, leading to the formation of gastruloids, which are aggregates of embryonic stem cells.96,97 Applying Geo-seq to the germ layers from pre- to late-stage gastrulation enabled the molecular genealogy of tissue lineages and the continuum of pluripotency states in time and space to be revealed. Furthermore, the molecular determinants that drive lineage specification and tissue patterning were identified.98 Tomo-seq and scRNA-seq revealed genome-wide gene expression patterns in mouse gastruloids and embryos, and identified various embryonic cell types that were not previously known to be present in gastruloids. Based on their results, the study’s authors proposed that somitogenesis occurs in gastruloids.99 In addition, ISH has determined the gene expression pattern in gastruloids generated from embryonic stem cells, to validate an in vitro model of early anteroposterior organization during human development.100 Stereo-seq has also reconstructed the spatially resolved developmental trajectories of cell-fate transitions and molecular changes during zebrafish embryogenesis.删除4：<u>101</u>\nSome research has also focused on the formation of organs in embryonic development. The large field-of-view and cellular resolution of Stereo-seq has been used to map the spatiotemporal transcriptomic dynamics during mouse organogenesis.102 ST was also used to study cardiac morphogenesis, and the spatiotemporal organ-wide gene expression and cell atlas of the developing human heart was established during 3 developmental stages.103 Morphogenesis of the human intestine across time, location, and cellular compartments has been charted by both scRNA-seq and 10X Genomics’ Visum.104 The gene expression profile of fetal livers from 8 to 17 weeks post-conception in humans has also been illustrated using 10X Genomics’ Visium.删除4：<u>105</u>\nHematopoiesis is the process by which blood cells are continually replenished throughout the lifetime of an organism, by virtue of the self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the regulation of the local microenvironment, or niche.106 Distinct waves of hematopoiesis have been defined during embryogenesis, including both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis.107,108 SRT technologies have been applied in developmental hematopoiesis to explore the generation and expansion of HSCs, as well as the regulation of their niche. Geo-seq, combined with bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, was used to examine the caudal hematopoietic tissue of zebrafish (the counterpart of the mammalian fetal liver) and a detailed spatiotemporal transcriptome of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and niche during HSPCs expansion was characterized.109 Meanwhile, LCM-seq has been used in the human embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region to identify secretory factors that promote human HSC development.110 Another study combined with 10X Genomic’s Visium and Stereo-seq identified novel HSC/MPP pocket-like units (HSC PLUS) composed of niche cells and enriched with growth factors; providing an essential resource for understanding HSC/MPP development in the fetal liver.111 In addition, 10X Genomic’s Visium was used to visualize HSC emergence in human embryonic tissues, including the liver, AGM, gut, and vitelline and umbilical vessels, validating the generation of AGM-like definitive HSPCs from human pluripotent stem cells.删除4：<u>112</u>\nscRNA-seq technologies have been widely performed in the adult hematopoietic system, and have confirmed the heterogeneity of HSPCs.113 However, SRT is yet to be applied in this field. Profiling the SRT of adult bone marrow would be of great significance because this will provide an opportunity to study the interplay between HSPCs and their niche under both normal conditions and stress. Most SRT methods require an intact slice of tissue, which may be challenging for adult bone marrow due to the presence of calcified bone. Therefore, tissue preparation and cryosectioning need to be optimized. Furthermore, bone marrow is composed of various hematopoietic cells and non-hematopoietic cells, including mesenchymal stromal cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.114,115 Importantly, bone marrow hematopoietic cells are usually smaller than other cell types, and the cells are usually distributed evenly in the bone marrow, lacking any apparent structure in terms of anatomical or functional division.116,117 These intrinsic features of bone marrow impede the experimental applications of SRT, as well as associated data processing. LCM-seq has been applied to study adult bone marrow to reveal bone marrow niche organization, setting an excellent example for future research.118 RNA-barcoding methods with improved resolution, such as Slide-seq, HDST and stereo-seq, are recommended for bone marrow, since the cellular or subcellular resolution is the key to compensating for smaller cells and diverse cell types. Furthermore, different types of HSPCs share high similarities in transcriptomics. Thus, we propose that SRT data can be properly analyzed only when combined with scRNA-seq data. Of note, in the past decade, single-cell transcriptomic data of bone marrow hematopoietic cells and niche cells has been collected, serving as a supporting resource for SRT.删除4：<u>114,115</u>\nSRT technologies provide an opportunity to uncover the molecular architecture of tissues. Methods that are more scalable, have a higher resolution and easier workflows are expected to be developed, and more results produced by SRT should be published soon. For the remainder of this review, we anticipate future developments that will unlock the full potential of SRT in both biological research and the clinic.\nThe correct association of detected mRNAs and single cells is a great challenge for both imaging- and sequencing-based methods. For most sequencing-based methods, such as Slide-seq and ST,26,35,37 the spatial information is retained in the form of differentially barcoded spots. Although some methods, including HDST, Stereo-seq and Seq-Scope, have achieved cellular or subcellular resolution,39,40,41 the spot boundaries do not correspond to the cell boundaries, meaning that transcripts captured in the same spot do not always come from a single cell. Furthermore, it cannot be guaranteed that the 10 μm-thin slices usually obtained during tissue sampling will contain a single layer of cells. This means that the transcripts of all the cells on the Z-axis or the vertical axis of the slide will be captured on the same spot. In imaging-based methods, the lack of cell boundaries makes it hard to associate individual mRNA molecules with the correct cells. In such methods, DAPI-stained nuclei may be the only method to determine cell outlines, especially when different cell types are very close together. In Sci-Space, which leverages sci-Plex to transfer DNA oligos into permeabilized nuclei, DAPI-stained nuclei and spatial coordinates of oligo transfer are co-registered. The nuclei from the tissue on the slide are also extracted to enable sci-RNA-seq.29 Although Sci-Space retains a single-cell resolution, it is hard to avoid contamination from adjacent cells. Moreover, the nuclei-assembling strategy may collapse when applied to tissues that contain irregularly shaped cells, such as neurons and glial cells in the brain. Regardless, we expect that more robust approaches will ultimately permit the characterization of the whole transcriptome of single cells. The elaboration of some cytomembrane-outlining strategies, such as immunofluorescent staining or auto-fluorescent reporter animals to visualize the plasma membrane, may help define cell boundaries and realize the potential of single-cell SRT. Existing rapid membrane imaging methods, such as fluorescent probe-based methods, have already been used to facilitate in situ plasma membrane imaging of neurons and erythrocytes in the complex environment of the brain.119 However, optimization of in situ plasma membrane imaging in combination with SRT still requires further work.\nSRT is far more than just transcriptomics; rather, the technique is empowered by the retained positional information provided by in situ methods. The locations of cells and the microenvironment play an important role in uncovering cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions, and the integration of functional and spatial information is of great benefit in biological studies. Spatially resolved transcriptomic methods provide several invaluable methods that can also be adapted to suit certain other in situ omics. We expect that SRT will inspire the development of other spatially resolved omics beyond transcriptomics, such as in situ epigenomics, epitranscriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, which will help us better understand different aspects of cell function. Epigenomics is a reliable tool to map chromatin accessibility dynamics and higher-order chromatin structure, and adding spatial information to this would surely enable new levels of understanding of cell-fate decisions, identity, and function.120,121 Epitranscriptomics concerns a wide range of post-transcriptional RNA modifications, and spatial epitranscriptomics enables studies under specific microenvironments, broadening our understanding of the spatial regulation of gene expression.122 In parallel, metabolomics transcends genomics and proteomics, representing the most downstream metabolic stage. The metabolome is widely accepted to constitute a dynamic and sensitive measure of phenotype, placing metabolomics at the forefront of biomarker discovery.123 Several spatially resolved metabolomic technologies have already been applied in several fields, such as tumor metabolism, allowing metabolites and metabolic enzymes to be directly discovered and studied in their native state.删除4：<u>124,125,126,127</u>\nOn the other hand, cell states that are defined based on data from one type of omics may not be accurate and comprehensive, and cell states defined by different omics may not always be in accordance. We therefore expect the emergence of more spatially resolved multimodal technologies, both at the experimental level and in computational analysis, to be able to simultaneously profile multiple data types in the same cell. For example, DBiT-seq can capture both proteins and transcripts on the same sequencing slide, so that proteomics and transcriptomics can be simultaneously performed on the same cells or tissues.38 We are also appreciative of and enthusiastic about methods that validate cell types, not just to predict transcriptomic states, but more importantly to provide more possibilities for multi-omic research. For example, some sequencing-based methods with high spatial resolution, such as Stereo-seq, involve the rapid staining and imaging of just the tissue nuclei to avoid mRNA degradation.40 Simultaneously retaining the mRNA, protein or metabolites in the same cells may be very challenging. Proper tissue preparation and fixation are essential to preserve the tissue, and so existing workflows containing these steps will need to be optimized to suit multimodal research.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Portal hypertension (PHT) not only is the aftermath of liver cirrhosis but also imposes a superimposed attack on the cirrhotic liver. It accounts for approximately one-third of hospitalizations due to massive variceal bleeding, refractory ascites, and liver and extrahepatic organ failures in the Department of Gastroenterology, West China Hospital. The high short-term mortality and long-lasting torment of PHT in patients have been pushing us to try to improve the outcome of the disease since 2000.\nWe could only deal with PHT reactively 20 years ago. The major treatments for variceal bleeding initially included balloon tamponade, restricted fluid resuscitation, and reduction of visceral blood flow by somatostatin. Endoscopic variceal ligation combined with propranolol was the only way to prevent variceal rebleeding. Although it is known that reduction of portal vein pressure is important in PHT, splenectomy and surgical variceal ligation were the available surgical options at that time.\nWith the new understanding of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), Prof. Chengwei Tang, the head of our department, introduced this interventional technique into our team first by continuing education and thereafter established a new medical team of interventional gastroenterology. After the TIPS technique was rooted in our department, cirrhotic patients benefited greatly from TIPS. At the beginning, TIPS was performed in strict accordance with its indications, and these indications almost fell into complications of cirrhosis at the late stage. Inspired by the preclinical research of our team,1 we realized that PHT is an important indicator in liver decompensation, and early reduction of PHT would be crucial for the quality of life and life span of liver cirrhosis patients. This notion dovetails with the current advocacy of early TIPS. In addition to aggressively decreasing portal vein pressure, chronic disease management after TIPS has been standardized in our department. Approximately 80% of patients in our follow-up survived more than 5 years after TIPS. The longest survival time of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis has been 16 years. TIPS has thus moved from a transitional treatment before liver transplantation to a lifesaving approach in decompensated liver cirrhosis. Approximately 400 patients received TIPS annually in our department.\nTIPS is one of the most complex techniques in interventional radiology. We insist on training TIPS professionals from young gastroenterologists. They are required not only to be skillful in interventional procedures but also to properly grasp the TIPS indications, deal with postoperative complications, and do a good job in the chronic disease management of these patients. Gastroenterologists and radiological interventional doctors often belong to two departments in many hospitals. Oriented with cirrhosis, we train young gastroenterologists who are good at both liver disease management and the TIPS technique. This innovative training model has greatly benefited patients and is also gaining popularity in China. We worked with national colleagues to publish the first consensus on TIPS application in patients with PHT in China 8 years ago.2 It will be republished after revision at the end of this year.\nVariceal bleeding is one of the leading causes of death from liver cirrhosis. Although TIPS is currently the preferred treatment for the prevention of rebleeding, the risk of recurrent variceal bleeding after TIPS remains an issue. Fragile collateral vessels are considered as a risk factor for rebleeding. Accordingly, TIPS combined with variceal embolization (TIPS+ E) was performed to prevent variceal rebleeding. A prospectively randomized controlled study conducted by our group demonstrated that the TIPS + E regimen may reduce the risks of variceal rebleeding after the TIPS procedure by preventing shunt dysfunction.删除4：<u>3</u>\nCavernous transformation of the portal vein (CTPV), also known as portal cavernoma, is a pathological condition resulting from complete extrahepatic portal vein obstruction with partial recanalization or collateral vein formation to bypass the obstruction. TIPS combined with or without portal vein recanalization is typically used in the treatment of patients with cirrhotic and noncirrhotic CTPV. We developed portal vein stenting (PVS) in the treatment of patients with noncirrhotic CTPV. PVS achieved a higher rate of stent patency (86.2%), a low risk of variceal rebleeding (4%), and no severe complications (unpublished data).\nSome children with PTH or CTPV refractory to conventional treatments have been successfully treated by TIPS in our department. The technical success reached 70% in these patients. The youngest patient was aged 26 months, and is the youngest reported TIPS patient worldwide to date.4 To avoid the drawbacks of splenectomy, we developed an angioplasty of the splenic vein that recovers the physiological hepatopetal blood flow.\nIt was safer and more effective to treat sinistral PHT-related gastrointestinal bleeding with a rebleeding rate dropping to 7.1%.5 Success is growing out of difficulties. We successfully addressed some difficult complications after the TIPS procedure. Intractable biliary obstruction occurred in a patient with biliary injury.

Due to its rich nutrition and delicious taste, the edible mushroom is an indispensable part of the diet around the world. The mushrooms can not only concentrate metal elements in soil, but also accumulate radionuclides in soil.1 Therefore, the radioactivity level of most mushrooms is much higher than that of other foods.删除4：<u>2,3</u>\nBefore the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the primary source of artificial radionuclides was radioactive fallout from nuclear tests. By comparing the content of radionuclides in mushrooms, it was found that the content of radionuclides in mushrooms increased ten times after the accident.4 Some countries have begun to monitor the content of radionuclides in mushrooms in the early years. The national food radioactivity monitoring network of the Netherlands and New Zealand and their updated monitoring programs include the radioactivity level in mushrooms.5,6 After the Fukushima nuclear accident, Japan promoted research on the radioactivity of wild mushrooms in the country, carried out regular monitoring, and formulated related policies.7,8 However, as a giant mushroom production, consumption, and export country, China has fewer data on the content of radionuclides in mushrooms. Therefore, it is necessary to study the level, distribution, and transfer of radionuclides in mushrooms in China.\nAt present, the radionuclides to study in mushrooms are divided into natural radionuclides and artificial radionuclides. The primary sources of natural radionuclides are uranium, thorium, potassium, and their decay radionuclides. These radionuclides cause internal exposure to the human body through particles in food, water, and air. As high toxic radionuclides, 210Pb and 210Po produce radon into the environment and then fall to the ground through rain or aerosol particles.9137Cs is an artificial radionuclide which, because of the nuclear power plant, is widely studied in food, including wild mushrooms.10 According to the UNSCEAR report,11 the activity of 137Cs released from atmospheric nuclear tests carried out worldwide in the 1950s and 1960s was as high as 9.6 × 1017 Bq. The Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear accidents also released a large amount of 137Cs into the environment, resulting in the highest activity of 137Cs accumulated in some mushrooms up to 50 MBq/kg.12 In Russia, Ukraine, and other countries that were greatly affected by the radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear accident, the concentration of 137Cs in mushrooms was as high as 10,000 Bq/kg, far exceeding the EU's limit of 600 Bq/kg for 137Cs.13 After the Fukushima nuclear accident, the specific activity of 137Cs in mushrooms in some areas of Japan reached 28,000 Bq/kg, which exceeded the legal dose limit of 350 Bq/kg in Japan.删除4：<u>14</u>\nHeilongjiang Province, Jilin Province, and Liaoning Province are collectively referred to as the \"Three Provinces of the East\" in China. With a forest coverage rate of up to 80%, abundant annual rainfall, and natural conditions with sufficient sunlight, the three provinces provide unique growth conditions for wild mushrooms and are the main mushroom-producing areas. Due to its delicious taste and high nutritional value, residents can eat 4.32, 67.87, 28.42 g fresh mushrooms daily in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning province, respectively.15 This study aims to analyze the distribution characteristics of radionuclide content in mushrooms based on the activity concentration of 238U, 226Ra, 232Th, 40K, and 137Cs in northeast China to evaluate the effective dose of mushrooms ingested on humans in this area.\nIn this study, a total of 68 samples of 18 species of mushrooms from the provinces of Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang provinces, and Beijing as control were collected from 2017 to 2020. The identification of mushroom species was carried out by the Beijing University of Agriculture and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. About 400 g of fruit body of each edible species was collected. Before the sample preparation, the foreign matters in the sample were removed, the sample was spread out, dried at 105 °C in the blast drying oven for 24 h, and then taken out. The sample was crushed by a food processing machine equipped with stainless steel knives, screened through 60 meshes, and loaded into a cylindrical sample box made of polyethene, with the specification of φ75 mm × 70 mm. The powder sample mushrooms were loaded, weighed, sealed (to prevent 222Rn volatilization), and placed for four weeks. After the radium activity was balanced, the radionuclides in mushrooms were measured by low background γ spectrometry.\nGEM50195 high-purity germanium γ-spectrometer (ORTEC Company, USA), with the detection efficiency 53% relative to the 3″ × 3″ NaI (Tl) crystal, the energy resolution 1.71 keV to 60Co 1,332 keV γ-rays; Gamma Vision spectrum analysis software; BE5030 wide-energy low-local high-purity germanium γ-spectrometer (CANBERRA Company, USA), with the detection efficiency 50.5% related to 3″ × 3″ NaI (Tl) crystals, and the energy resolution 1.65 keV to 60Co 1,332 keV γ-rays; Gennie 2000 spectrum analysis software.\nDuring the measurement, the energy resolution of system and channel site drift are checked every day, and the spectrometer is calibrated according to relevant standards and publications. The full-energy peak efficiency curve method is used to analyze and determine the specific activity of the sample. The main nuclides for analysis include natural radionuclides 238U, 226Ra, 232Th, 40K, and artificial radionuclide 137Cs.\nThe activity of 238U was measured at 63.29 keV of 232Th. The activity of 226Ra was measured at 351.92 keV and 609.32 keV. The activity of 232Th was measured at 583.19 keV of 208Tl and 911.07 keV of 228Ac, and the activities of 40K and 137Cs were measured by the emitted 1,460.75 keV and 661.66 keV. The measurement time of sample is 86,400 s. The background spectrum is obtained by measuring the empty sample box before and after the sample is measured, and the measurement time is 170,084 s. After the measurement, the sample spectrum is analyzed to obtain the specific activities of 238U, 226Ra, 232Th, 40K, 137Cs radionuclides. The calculation formula is as follows,16\nwhere A and A0 are the specific activities of the nuclides in the sample and the standard source, Bq/kg; N and N0 are the net counts of the γ-ray characteristic peaks in the mushroom sample and the standard source, respectively; t and t0 are the measured time of mushroom sample and the standard source respectively, s; B is the background peak net count rate, counts/s; M is the mass of the sample, kg.\nBefore the measurement, traceable standard sources are used to calibrate the energy and efficiency of the system. The standard source used for mushrooms is provided by the National Institute of Metrology, China, and the standard spiked solution used can be traced to the United States NIST. The matrix of standard sources used to calibrate was rice powder and spinach powder, respectively. For the tested samples with density different significantly from the efficiency calibration standard source, the characterized and traceable LabSOCS software is used to calculate the corresponding efficiency of the specific sample. The metrological verification department regularly verifies the measurement system of the high-purity germanium gamma spectrometer. The lab participates in the comparison assessment organized by the relevant national departments and the international radioactivity measurement comparison every year, and the results are satisfactory.删除4：<u>16</u>\nSPSS 26 software was used for statistical analysis. The activity of radionuclides in mushrooms at different sites was analyzed by One-way analysis of variance. The correlation of different radionuclides in mushrooms was analyzed by regression analysis. P < 0.05 indicated that the difference was statistically significant.\nAll the collected mushrooms were edible wild mushrooms, which the local people widely used. 238U was not detected in all mushroom samples. The proportions of activity of 226Ra, 232Th, 40K, and 137Cs above the detection limit were 62%, 24%, 100% and 66%, respectively. The activity concentrations of 226Ra, 232Th, 40K, and 137Cs detected in 68 samples of mushrooms ranged 1-34.3, 2.26-32.3, 208-2,388, and 0.6-130.3 Bq/kg, respectively. The activities of radionuclides in mushroom samples from different sampling sites were shown in Table 1.\nActivity concentrations of mushroom samples at different sites [Bq/(kg, dry weight), activity concentration ± uncertainty (range)].\n删除重复语句：<u>Activity concentrations of mushroom samples at different sites [Bq/(kg, dry weight), activity concentration ± uncertainty (range)].</u>\nNote: ND means not detected. 238U is ND. Compared among different sites, F = 15.9 and P < 0.05 for 40K; F = 1.15 and P = 0.33 for 137Cs.\nThe measured results of 238U activity showed that the accumulation of uranium collected by mushrooms is small, which is consistent with the conclusion that the mushroom has a low ability of bio-enrichment of uranium isotopes reported in the literature.17 By comparing the activity concentrations of each radionuclide in 18 kinds of mushrooms, four kinds of radionuclides can be detected in Lepista nuda. Furthermore, the activity concentrations of 226Ra and 137Cs were the highest, which indicated that these mushrooms may have a stronger affinity for radionuclides, more easily absorb radionuclides in soil, or may be used as an indicator of radioactive caesium. However, because there was only one sample of Lepista nuda, it is not ruled out that 137Cs are unevenly distributed in the region due to the influence of wind direction, precipitation, and other natural conditions in settlement from the atmosphere to the soil. Therefore, it is necessary to measure and analyze the radioactivity of the soil around Lepista nuda and other sampling points.\nThe ability of Armillaria mellea, Hygrophorus lucorum Kalchbr, and Lepista nuda to concentrate 232Th was almost the same, but the content of 40K in A. mellea, H. lucorum, Sarcomyxa edulis and Lactarius deliciosus was 40%-50%, higher than other kinds of mushrooms. Potassium participates in the osmotic regulation of cations and water in cells and acts as a cofactor of enzymes. It is an essential functional metal element in mushrooms. The chemical state of potassium in the soil, the content of other competitive alkaline ions, and the bioavailability of potassium will affect the absorption of mushrooms. Therefore, the content of 40K in different kinds of mushrooms may be quite different.删除4：<u>18</u>\nTable 2 shows the activity concentrations of radionuclides in mushrooms from different countries and regions. The average values of 40K and 137Cs in mushrooms measured in this study are higher than those reported in other studies on radioactivity levels of mushrooms in Yunnan and low altitude areas in Sichuan province.19,20,21,22 This may be related to the difference in soil radioactivity level and mushroom varieties. It is worth noted that the activity concentration of 137Cs in Chanterelle mushrooms is very low in Yunnan province, with a maximum value of 1.2 Bq/kg,23 which is lower than the species in this study. Moreover, the Wolfiporia extensa fungus is characterized by a very low content of 40K compared to many saprobic and mycorrhizal mushrooms.24 Some studies have shown that the activity of 137Cs in mushrooms varied with altitude and low temperature.25 The 40K and 137Cs activity concentrations of mushrooms in this study are lower than those collected in Minya Konka. The mushrooms collected in this study are located in northeast China, with the average temperature -20 °C in winter, which may be one of the reasons for the high content of radionuclides in mushrooms.\nActivity concentrations and standard limits of radionuclides in mushrooms [Bq/(kg, dry weight), range] from different countries.\n删除重复语句：<u>Activity concentrations and standard limits of radionuclides in mushrooms [Bq/(kg, dry weight), range] from different countries.</u>\nNote: CAC. Codex Alimentarius Commission; EU. European Union.\nThe Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011 had different degrees of impact on Asian countries. The 137Cs content in mushrooms of China and Iraq was almost the same. South Korea was greatly affected by Japan, and the 137Cs content in mushrooms was slightly higher. Seven years after the accident, the 137Cs content in mushrooms of Japan was still as high as 1,106 Bq/kg, far higher than the radioactive level of mushrooms in other Asian countries. It can be found from Table 2 that the radioactivity level of mushrooms in Europe is higher than that in Asian countries as a whole due to the influence of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and nuclear test in earlier years. In general, the contents of natural radionuclides 238U, 226Ra, 232Th, and 137Cs in this study are at a normal level, lower than the activity limits specified by Chinese standards, CAC (Codex Alimentarius Commission) and EU (European Union).\nStudies have shown that potassium can inhibit the absorption of Cs by plants. In the same concentration of the medium, the plants absorbed K+, Rb+, Cs+ with the same mechanism and absorption rate. However, if K+ is added to the medium, plants will inhibit the absorption of Cs+.35 Plants always absorb K first when Cs and K exist at the same time, because Cs is not the element needed by plants. However, plants also absorb Cs because Cs and K have similar ionic charges and radius. Therefore, 137Cs can be absorbed from soil by mushrooms through a 40K transport channel.36 Some studies have also shown that the application of potassium fertilizer in the soil can reduce the absorption of Cs by plants, which can be used as an effective method of radioactive soil decontamination.18 Therefore, this study explored the content of Cs and K in mushrooms and the relationship between Cs and K in mushrooms.\n通用删除16(英):<u>Fig. 1 shows the distribution of 40K and 137Cs in mushroom samples from four sampling areas. To compare the difference of radionuclide content in mushroom samples from four areas, mushroom samples from different sites were divided into four groups.

The results showed that there was a significant difference in 40K content in mushroom samples from four areas (F= 15.9, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in 137Cs content among different areas (F = 1.15, P = 0.33). Previous studies have shown that the absorption of 137Cs by mushrooms from the soil is due to the chemical properties similar to K, but the relationship between 137Cs and 40K in mushrooms is not clear.37 Because of the significant difference of 40K content in different areas, it is speculated that 137Cs content in mushroom increases with the content of 40K. The regression analysis of 137Cs and 40K in all samples was carried out to explore the correlation of different radionuclides in mushrooms. As shown in Fig. 2, the results showed that there was no correlation between 137Cs and 40K in mushrooms (r = 0.014, P = 0.19), which may be affected by mushroom species. For the same radionuclide, the symbiotic fungi can act as a filter for host plants to absorb radionuclides. Therefore, the concentration of radionuclides in symbiotic fungi is higher than that in saprophytic fungi and parasitic fungi.</u>\nTo evaluate the effective dose caused by eating wild mushrooms to Chinese residents, the effective dose caused by eating wild mushrooms was estimated according to the dose estimation model given by UNSCEAR 2000 and ICRP 103,38 combined with the relevant parameters of China's basic safety standard. The calculation formula is as follows,\nwhere AED is the annual effective dose rate, mSv/a; RI is the active concentration of radionuclide in mushroom, Bq/kg; e(T) is the effective dose coefficient, in which mushroom is 1.3 × 10-8 Sv/Bq;38AI was the annual intake of mushroom per capita in adults, kg/a.\nTable 3 showed that if adults ingested mushroom Lepista nuda, the annual effective doses caused by 137Cs (130.3 Bq/kg) were 0.0026, 0.042, 0.018 mSv/a for residents in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces, respectively.

Some studies have shown that the stir-fried mushroom meals on the whole (wet) weight exhibited on average around 3.5-fold greater activity concentration of 137Cs compared with raw mushrooms.39 Therefore, people in northeast China eat mushrooms with the highest content of 137Cs by stir-fried, which would cause an annual effective of 0.15 mSv.\nThe activity concentrations of 238U, 226Ra, 232Th, 40K, and 137Cs in 68 samples of 18 species of mushrooms collected from four cities in Northeast China were investigated. These mushrooms are wild mushrooms that residents often eat. 238U was undetected in all samples because of the high detection limit. This result was consistent with the low bio-enrichment ability of mushrooms.17 Among the collected mushroom species, the content of 137Cs in Lepista nuda is the highest, indicating that it may be used as an indicator of radioactive pollution in the ecosystem. It was noteworthy that the average contents of 40K and 137Cs were the highest in Heilongjiang province, as previous studies showed that the activity of 137Cs in mushrooms is related to altitude and low temperature.25 The low temperature in Heilongjiang may be one of the reasons for the high content of radionuclides in mushrooms. The statistical analysis explored the relationship between 137Cs and 40K in mushrooms. The results showed that there was no correlation between 137Cs and 40K in mushrooms (r = 0.014, P = 0.19). Moreover, 137Cs can be absorbed from soil by mushrooms through a 40K transport channel.36 Further research in the relationship between 40K in soil and 137Cs in mushrooms is needed.\nRisk analysis of radioactivity in collected mushrooms was carried out to evaluate the effective dose to the human body caused by mushroom consumption. The results showed that the annual effective dose caused by 137Cs in Lepista nuda was 0.0026, 0.042, 0.018 for residents in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces, respectively. Moreover, different cooking methods will affect the content of radionuclides in mushrooms.39 If people in northeast China eat mushrooms with the highest content of 137Cs by stir-fried, which would cause an annual effective of 0.15 mSv. Therefore, 137Cs concentration activities in mushrooms from northeast China are low, and their consumption is considered safe. The results of this study are of great significance to evaluate the additional effective dose caused by human ingestion and can provide a reference for the study of ecological radiation pollution in northeast China.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

HepG2 cells were from Bumrungrad Biomedical Technology (HUCL-0085; Jiangyin, Jiangsu, China).\nHepG2 cells were prepared with different stimulations as follows:\nTo investigate the effects of high fructose on lipid accumulation induced by fructose, HepG2 cells were stimulated with 0, 1, 5, or 20 mmol/L fructose for 12, 24, 48, or 72 h.To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, HepG2 cells were treated with 20 mmol/L fructose or 0.25 mmol/L PA for 72 h.To explore the causal relationships between ERS and lipogenesis, the ERS inhibitor TUDCA (0.2 mmol/L) was added after HepG2 cells were cultured with 20 mmol/L fructose for 24 h, and other HepG2 cells were cultured with the ERS inducer thapsigargin (600 nmol/L) for 10 h (without fructose pretreatment).To investigate the immediate effects of XBP-1 on lipid accumulation and whether XBP-1 mediates high-fructose-induced lipid metabolism, XBP-1 expression was downregulated using cell transfection with an shRNA targeting XBP-1, and the active form XBP-1s was upregulated using cell transfection with vector pcDNA 3.1-XBP-1s.\nTo investigate the effects of high fructose on lipid accumulation induced by fructose, HepG2 cells were stimulated with 0, 1, 5, or 20 mmol/L fructose for 12, 24, 48, or 72 h.\nTo elucidate the underlying mechanisms, HepG2 cells were treated with 20 mmol/L fructose or 0.25 mmol/L PA for 72 h.\nTo explore the causal relationships between ERS and lipogenesis, the ERS inhibitor TUDCA (0.2 mmol/L) was added after HepG2 cells were cultured with 20 mmol/L fructose for 24 h, and other HepG2 cells were cultured with the ERS inducer thapsigargin (600 nmol/L) for 10 h (without fructose pretreatment).\nTo investigate the immediate effects of XBP-1 on lipid accumulation and whether XBP-1 mediates high-fructose-induced lipid metabolism, XBP-1 expression was downregulated using cell transfection with an shRNA targeting XBP-1, and the active form XBP-1s was upregulated using cell transfection with vector pcDNA 3.1-XBP-1s.\nAfter the different stimulations, HepG2 cells were harvested for TG measurement and Oil Red O staining. Metabolic factors involved in lipogenesis (i.e. FAS, SCD-1, and ACC) were detected using Western blotting analysis, and gene expression of the lipogenic pathway regulators SREBP-1c and ChREBP was evaluated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nFor cell transient transfection, Lipofectamine 2000 was used. Briefly, HepG2 cells were cultured in 6-well plates. XBP-1 plasmids or empty vectors transduced into HepG2 cells. Then, cells were transfected with 0.8 g vector DNA using 2 μl Lipofectamine 2000 in 2 ml serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) per well. After 8 h, the medium was replaced with 10% fetal bovine serum DMEM. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and subsequently harvested for determination.\nAfter the different treatments described above, HepG2 cells were collected to wash twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then treated with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer for 30 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 20 min at 4°C for getting the supernatant. The concentration of protein was measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). TG levels were measured based on an enzymatic assay from a method adapted for 96-well plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pulilai Bioengineering Institute).\nCultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 30 min and stained with 1% Oil Red O for 2 h. The stained sections were observed with an Olympus microscope and examined by a pathologist in a blinded manner.\nAnalyses on gene transcript levels were conducted by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. After washing HepG2 cells twice with PBS, total mRNA was extracted using a standard TRIzol RNA isolation method通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> after stimulation as described above. The concentration and purity of total RNA were measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA was reverse transcribed using the Easy Script First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Super Mix kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM 7300 PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR Green I GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). PCRs were performed in a total volume of 25 μl as follows: 95°C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 58°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 30 s in the end. Each sample’s gene expression was analyzed in duplicate and normalized against that of GAPDH used as an internal control. Results are expressed as relative gene expression, determined using the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method and normalized by GAPDH as an internal control.\nThe primers were: GAPDH: forward 5’-GGATGATGTTCTGGAGAGCC-3’ and reverse 5’-CATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGC-3’; SREBP1c: forward 5’-CTTCCGCCCTTGAGCTG-3’ and reverse 5’-CTGGTGTGTCCGTGTGG-3’; and CHREBP: forward 5’-TGCGGGATGAGATTGAGGA-3’ and reverse 5’-TCCAGTTGTGCAGCGTAC-3’.\nProteins were extracted from HepG2 cells which were cultured in 25 cm-bottom-surface bottle. Cells were washed by 4°C PBS for 2 times firstly. Then, cells were added with 1 ml RIPA and 10 μl PMSF. The cells were collected with a cell scraper blow gently, after which in a centrifuge tube. Up steps were operated on ice. Clumps of cells were placed in 4000 ×g centrifugation at 4°C for 30 min. Supernatant of 800 μl mixture was kept at −80°C. The concentration of protein was measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Proteins were mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. Then, protein samples were separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and blocked with nonfat dry milk for 2 h at 37°C. Then, membranes were probed with antibodies (primary antibodies against SCD-1, ACC, IRE-1, p-IRE-1, XBP-1s, FAS, XBP-1u, PERK, p-eIF-2α, eIF-2α, and β-actin) overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, membranes were rinsed three times with TBST, after which they were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. After incubation, membranes were washed three times with TBST and followed by detection with electrochemiluminescence method. And, β-actin was used as an internal control.\nAll data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests were used for between-group comparisons. The analysis of variance multiple comparison test (SPSS 11.0, SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was used for comparisons among groups. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe lipotoxic effects of fructose in hepatocytes were investigated by culturing HepG2 cells in the presence of normal medium (N group) or medium containing different concentrations of fructose (1, 5, or 20 mmol/L; F1, F5, and F20 groups, respectively) for different times (12, 24, 48, or 72 h). Fructose increased TG levels in HepG2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. TG levels reached maximal value after 72 h incubation with 20 mmol/L fructose; thus, 20 mmol/L fructose was used in subsequent experiments 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u>. Oil red O staining showed an obvious increase in lipid droplets in HepG2 cells cultured with 20 mmol/L fructose compared with those cultured with other fructose concentrations 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b]</u>. PA increased lipid accumulation in the liver by providing substrate for TG synthesis. To explore the different mechanisms by which fructose induced lipid accumulation, HepG2 cells were cultured in the presence of 20 mmol/L fructose or 0.2 mmol/L PA. As expected, compared with HepG2 cells incubated with PA, high (20 mmol/L) fructose increased the mRNA expression of the two upstream transcription factors SREBP1c and CHREBP 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2b, all P < 0.01]</u> and the protein contents of the three downstream enzymes ACC, FAS, and SCD-1 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2c, all P < 0.01]</u>. However, TG levels in HepG2 cells were not significantly different between groups 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2a]</u>.\nTo determine the causal relationship between ERS and lipid metabolism, HepG2 cells were cultured with ordinary medium, 20 mmol/L fructose alone, 20 mmol/L fructose plus 0.2 mmol/L TUDCA, or 600 nmol/L thapsigargin alone. The fructose-induced increase in TG level and Oil Red O straining was ameliorated by TUDCA treatment of HepG2 cells (P < 0.01), whereas thapsigargin increased TG levels and Oil Red O straining 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3a and 3c, P < 0.01]</u>. Furthermore, TUDCA pretreatment decreased the fructose-induced increases in SREBP1c, CHREBP (all P < 0.01), and SCD-1, FAS, and ACC expression (all P < 0.05), whereas thapsigargin increased the expression of all factors 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3b and 3d]</u>. TUDCA pretreatment of HepG2 cells blocked fructose-induced phosphorylation of IRE-1, as well as activation of XBP-1 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3e, P < 0.05]</u>. Compared with HepG2 cells incubated with normal medium, those incubated with thapsigargin showed an increase in this arm of the UPR 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3e, P < 0.05]</u>.\nIn this series of experiments, the level of the active form XBP-1 (XBP-1s) was decreased after transfecting cells with an shRNA targeting XBP-1 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4a, P < 0.01]</u>. Triglyceride level in XBP-1 shRNA group decreased significantly compared with high-fructose group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4b and 4c, 4.41 ± 0.54 μmol/g vs. 6.52 ± 0.38 μmol/g, P < 0.001]</u>. Expression of the upstream lipogenic transcription factors SREBP-1c and CHREBP mRNA was measured by PCR. SREBP-1c was significantly downregulated in XBP-1 shRNA group (2.92 ± 0.46 vs. 5.08 ± 0.41, P < 0.01), but CHREBP was not 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4d]</u>. The protein contents of the key downstream lipogenic enzymes FAS (0.53 ± 0.06 vs. 0.85 ± 0.05, P = 0.01), SCD-1 (0.65 ± 0.06 vs. 0.90 ± 0.04, P = 0.04), and ACC (0.38 ± 0.03 vs. 0.95 ± 0.06, P < 0.01) were significantly decreased in XBP-1-deficient HepG2 cells 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4e]</u>.\nTo further investigate the causal relationship between XBP-1 and de novo lipogenesis, active XBP-1s was overexpressed by transfection with a XBP-1s vector. As shown by Western blotting analysis 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5a]</u>, XBP-1s protein expression was induced after transfection for 8 h with vector pcDNA 3.1-XBP-1s, but not with vector cDNA 3.1-XBP-1u (P < 0.01). Cellular TG accumulation was higher in HepG2 cells overexpressing XBP-1s than in those cultured in ordinary medium or transfected with empty vector or vector pcDNA 3.1-XBP-1u 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5b and 5c, 4.22 ± 0.54 μmol/g vs. 2.41 ± 0.35 μmol/g, P < 0.001]</u>. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed a significant increase in SREBP1c mRNA expression in HepG2 cells transfected with XBP-1s upregulation vector (2.70 ± 0.33 vs. 1.00 ± 0.00, P < 0.01), but CHREBP mRNA showed no change in expression 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5d]</u>. XBP-1s upregulation also significantly increased SCD-1 (0.93 ± 0.06 vs. 0.26 ± 0.05, P < 0.01), ACC (0.98 ± 0.09 vs. 0.43 ± 0.03, P < 0.01), and FAS (0.90 ± 0.33 vs. 0.71 ± 0.02, P = 0.04) protein content compared with the untransfected group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5e]</u>.\nChronic fructose consumption is considered as a contributing factor in the development of NAFLD.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> There is now a great interest in the mechanism by which high fructose induces fatty liver. Acquired and accumulated excessive TGs in hepatocytes may be considered as the first step of the \"two hits\" in the progression of NAFLD.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic steatosis,通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> satisfactory treatment modalities remain limited. The liver is the predominant organ in the body delegated to de novo lipogenesis. This process, in which fatty acids are newly synthesized from acetyl coenzyme A (converted from glucose through the tricarboxylic acid cycle), usually contributes about one-third of all TG in hepatocytes, but this contribution increases by approximately 6-fold in the abnormal state.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> Two key transcription factors, SREBP-1c and ChREBP, and three key target enzymes, ACC, FAS, and SCD-1, participate in the lipogenesis process. In the present study, by determining TG levels and by histologic analysis, we demonstrated that fructose increased lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. This study also demonstrated that factors associated with de novo TG synthesis (i.e. ACC, FAS, SCD-1, SREBP-1c, and ChREBP) were increased in HepG2 cells incubated with high fructose (20 mmol/L), compared with those incubated with PA (a saturated free fatty acid). Consequently, the findings suggest that chronic intake of fructose induces lipid accumulation through lipogenesis.\nThe UPR is an adaptive signaling pathway triggered in response to perturbations in ER homeostasis, conditions referred to as ERS.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,19]</u> Recent animal and human studies have revealed on the one hand that obesity and fatty liver are associated with ERS-associated factors通用删除6(英):<u>[21,35,36]</u> and that these diseases can be attenuated by chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid, Schisandra chinensis extract, or gastric bypass surgery.通用删除6(英):<u>[21,37,38]</u> On the other hand, lipotoxic stress leads to ERS activation in the liver,通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> so the causal relationship between ERS and lipogenesis remains to be clarified. Whereas these previous studies were based on human and animal experiments, the present study examined the role of ERS in lipogenesis at a cellular level. To investigate the role of ERS in fructose-induced lipogenesis, we first tested whether the putative chemical chaperone TUDCA (an ERS inhibitor) protected against experimental ERS in HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of fructose. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with TUDCA suppressed fructose-induced ERS (IRE-1 and XBP-1) and de novo lipogenesis (mRNA expression of SREBP-1c and ChREBP and protein content of ACC, SCD-1, and FAS). Conversely, thapsigargin (an ERS inducer) increased the expression of PERK, eIF2α, IRE-1, XBP-1, and factors involved in lipogenesis. Although other studies have demonstrated that ERS may interfere with insulin signaling, inhibit insulin action in liver, and thereby affect lipid accumulation,通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> this study provides evidence for a direct effect of ERS on lipogenesis. On this basis, we speculate that there may be a positive feedback loop between ERS and lipogenesis, and therefore that reducing ERS is a key to reducing lipogenesis and reversing NAFLD.\nIRE1/XBP-1 is one of the three classic ERS pathways associated with growth, differentiation, and cellular apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> Recent studies in animals and cells have shed light on the role of XBP-1 in numerous diseases, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> XBP-1 protein expression in mice was elevated after mice were fed carbohydrates, and deletion of XBP-1 resulted in marked hypocholesterolemia and hypotriglyceridemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Fatty liver induced by a high-calorie diet could be protected against by decreasing XBP-1.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> The 3T3-L1 cells with XBP1 or IRE1α knockdown and XBP1 -deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed significantly weakened adipogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> Further studies showed that selectively knocking down the XBP1 gene in the liver decreased critical genes involved in fatty acid synthesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Our study showed that in the presence of high fructose (20 mmol/L), there was significant upregulation of XBP-1s (active form) and downregulation of XBP-1u (inactive form). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we investigated hepatic regulation of TG synthesis by activating XBP-1. XBP-1s overexpression increased cellular TG accumulation, which was accompanied by increased mRNA expression of SREBP-1c and protein content of three key target enzymes associated with lipogenesis, ACC, FAS, and SCD-1, but not by a change in ChREBP mRNA expression. Again, silencing of XBP-1s expression effectively prevented against the lipid deposition in HepG2 cells induced by high fructose, by decreasing the transcriptional expression of de novo lipogenesis genes to alleviate further lipotoxic stress. Therefore, we explored the causal relationship between XBP-1s and lipid accumulation and found that high fructose-induced cellular lipid deposition in NAFLD was partially regulated by XBP-1s.\nSREBP-1c and ChREBP are mediators of the transcriptional effects of lipogenic enzyme genes. Lipogenic genes such as FAS, ACC, and SCD-1 are activated by both SREBP-1c and ChREBP. SREBP-1c mainly targets glucokinase, the first enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, as well as FAS and ACC.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> SREBPs are synthesized as inactive precursors bound to the membranes of the ER and thus must undergo proteolytic cleavage to liberate their N-terminal domain, which constitutes the mature transcription factor. ERS could induce cleavage of the precursor form of SREBP-1c (increasing the expression of the mature form of SREBP-1c in the nucleus) and expression of SREBP-1c target genes independent of insulin, but the role of XBP-1 is unclear.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> Lee et al.’s research shows that the genetic deletion of XBP-1 in liver leads to a decrease in de novo lipid synthesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Our research indicates that XBP-1 is associated with SREBP-1c without ChREBP, but further experiment need to be done to research the exact mechanism. However, our study convinced that the high fructose accelerates ERS to enhance de novo lipogenesis.\nOur study had several limitations. First, we investigated the effect of XBP-1 on lipogenesis in vitro; rodent experiments are needed to verify our results in vivo. Second, ERS includes three pathways, and research has shown that transcription factor-4 activation contributes to lipid accumulation; thus, XBP-1 may be only partially responsible for ERS aggravation.\nThe present study provides novel insight into the mechanisms involved in fructose-mediated hepatic hypertriglyceridemia and identifies ERS as a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD. Furthermore, we show that XBP-1 plays a critical role in de novo lipogenesis during NAFLD.\nTo sum up, exposure of HepG2 cells to fructose resulted in increased hepatic lipid deposition via acceleration of de novo lipogenesis compared with PA exposure. In addition, the findings suggest that XBP-1 is crucial for lipid synthesis. Thus, using compounds that selectively target XBP-1 may be beneficial in the treatment of NAFLD.\nWe thank Hao Jun (Department of Pathology, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China) for XBP-1s and XBP-1u vectors.

It uses a large amount of public clinical data to help researchers more effectively to study the characteristics of tumors and improve our ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer. The purpose of this study was to use the estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm to calculate the immune and stromal scores of LUAD patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, explore the correlation between the scores and the survival of LUAD patients, and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the immune/stromal scores. In addition, we also judged the prognostic value of DEGs and further studied their potential molecular functions.\nRecently, the focus of cancer-related research has been gradually turned to the tumor microenvironment based on cell biology and molecular mechanisms, which plays a major role in the progression of cancer including LUAD. Malignant tumor cells, mesenchymal cells, inflammatory mediators, endothelial cells, stromal cells, immune cells, and normal epithelial cells are involved to constitute the microenvironment of tumor.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> For the development of prognostic and predictive biomarkers, an in-depth study on the expression of related genes in tumor immune microenvironment is of much significance. To assess the stromal and immune cells in tumor samples for their infiltration, Yoshihara et al通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> designed an algorithm known as ESTIMATE to predict the number of stromal and immune cells in tumor samples based on the unique characteristics of the transcriptional profiles of cancer samples. To predict the infiltration of non-tumor cells, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis was conducted for calculating the stromal and immune scores. In the prediction of prostate cancer, glioblastoma, colon cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia, the ESTIMATE algorithm has been used to obtain a large number of genes with prognostic value. In this study, the immune/stromal scores of LUAD patients were analyzed in the TCGA database using the ESTIMATE algorithm in package edgeR. We identified DEGs by the \"limma\" package in R (Version 3.6.3). The prognostic value of DEGs was further verified by Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) plotter database, and various bioinformatics tools, including Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the function and signaling pathway of these genes.\nFirst, after the cases of missing clinical information were excluded, a total of 522 LUAD patients with clinical characteristics information were recruited. The clinicopathological factors extracted for analysis include age, gender, T stage, N stage, M stage, and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Among them, the number of female patients is 280 (53.6%), while that of male patients is 242 (46.4%). On average, the age was 66 years with a range from 33 to 88 years. Ignoring the samples with undetermined TNM stage, the proportions of T stage were T1 (172, 33.0%), T2 (281, 53.8%), T3 (47, 9.0%), T4 (19, 3.6%); the proportions of N stage were N0 (335, 64.2%), N1 (98, 18.8%), N2 (75, 14.4%), N3 (2, 0.4%); the proportions of M stage were M0 (353, 67.6%), and M1 (25, 4.8%). As shown in Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A454, the patients in stages I and II with no metastasis account for over half. Besides, the ESTIMATE algorithm was applied to calculate the immune and stromal scores of all patients. Depending on their median, the stromal and immune scores were divided into two groups. The stromal scores of LUAD patients varied between -372.83 and 351.82, and the immune scores varied from -172.02 to 656.87. As shown in Figure 1A, the K-M survival curves were generated by high- and low-score groups. According to K-M survival analysis, the low immune score group indicates poor overall survival in LUAD cohort (P = 0.013). Moreover, the group of stromal score and overall survival time revealed no clear distinction (P = 0.038). The differential expression analysis was conducted on the expression profile of LUAD from the TCGA database to investigate how gene expression profiles relate to immune and stromal scores. The genes with differentiated expression in the high and low immune score group can be displayed in the heatmap (|fold change| > 1, P < 0.05), and the Venn diagrams were plotted to show that there were 64 commonly up-regulated DEGs and eight commonly down-regulated DEGs. In addition, the gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of these 72 co-expressed DEGs showed that they are all related to the immune process 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Figure 1, http://links. lww.com/CM9/A454]</u>. With the STRING database, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was obtained. As shown in Figure 1B, we discovered that the PPI network contained 49 nodes and 172 edges. Then, the MCODE was employed to cluster the analysis of PPI network and obtain two significant modules 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C and Figure 1D]</u>. Additionally, the interacting genes were introduced into Cytoscape, based on which the top ten genes with the cytoHubba were identified 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1E]</u>.\nNext, we performed a survival analysis on 64 DEGs that were commonly up-regulated and eight DEGs that were commonly down-regulated. Of the 72 common DEGs in the immune score group and stromal score group, 22 genes were associated with the prognosis of LUAD patients as revealed by the log-rank test (P < 0.05). The typical genes are shown in Supplementary Figure 2, http://links.lww. com/CM9/A454. Functional enrichment analysis of 22 prognostic-related genes showed that these genes are related to immune response 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Figure 3, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A454]</u>. Importantly, we determined that six of 22 genes also have prognostic value in the GEO database 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Figure 4, http://links.lww. com/CM9/A454]</u>. And five of the above-mentioned six genes were also verified in the K-M plotter, which are ABI3BP, CSF2RB(IL5RB), KBTBD8, PKHD1L1, and SCML4 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1F]</u>. These five genes are regarded as key genes. Finally, we used the biocarta gene sets to perform GSEA on five key genes, and the results showed that many gene sets in the samples with high expression of the five key genes were positively enriched. The five most significantly correlated pathways of five key genes are shown in order in Supplementary Figures 5 to 9, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A454.\nHerein, we used the ESTIMATE algorithm to calculate the immune/stromal scores of LUAD patients from TCGA, found immune-related DEGs with prognostic value in the tumor immune microenvironment, and used multi-omics data mining technology to explore the potential molecular functions and pathways of these genes. As a result, five key genes (CSF2RB, PKHD1L1, ABI3BP, SCML4, and KBTBD8) are of great interest to better understand the prognosis of LUAD patients. ABI3BP, a potential biomarker of lung cancer, has been proven to be significantly suppressed in lung cancer cell lines.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> The up-regulation of ABI3BP in gallbladder cancer has been reported to repress the development of gallbladder cancer via inhibiting H3K27 methylation induced by EZH2.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> CSF2RB serves as an apoptosis inducer in cancer cells通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and PKHD1L1 as an inhibitor of cell growth and invasion in thyroid cancer cells,通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> which are potential therapeutic targets for LUAD. The particular role of KBTBD8 and SCML4 in cancers has not been reported. Furthermore, the five most significant-related pathways of the five key genes by GSEA involve the TCR, IL2RB, FCER1, FMLP, CTCF, TOB1, CTLA4, GH, IL7, NO2IL12, IL12, and TH1TH2 signaling pathways. However, the particular mechanism of these signalings needs to be verified based on more in vivo and in vitro experiments.\nIn addition, this study focuses on the application of the ESTIMATE algorithm and various bioinformatics technologies. The value of key genes has not been further verified through experiments on human samples. These experiments will be resolved promptly in our future publications. In summary, the genes related to the immune microenvironment of LUAD were investigated using the ESTIMATE algorithm, based on which the function and prognostic values of these key genes were analyzed through integrated bioinformatics. The five key genes are likely to be potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers, which make it necessary to conduct further research in this regard.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

However, the ED faced two challenges in China. There were no limitations to the medical resources that could be accessed by ED patients, and health care providers could not deny patients. Thus, the ED was overcrowded, making it difficult to distinguish critically ill patients from those requiring non-emergency treatment.\nOn the other hand, critically ill patients require a teambased approach to care to ensure they receive sequential and consistent treatments. However, emergency physicians were only responsible for patients on their shifts. Previous theoretical and applied research通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> has demonstrated that critically ill patients greatly benefit when the management of the ED and intensive care unit (ICU) effectively integrates advanced theories and techniques of critical care medicine in emergent stages of the disease. Therefore, based on the actual clinical situation of our hospital and the implementation of innovative behavioral strategies, we innovatively integrated the management of the ED and general ICU. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of integrating ED and general ICU management on emergency medical care.\nA five-level adult emergency triage standard was developed based on the \"Emergency classification guidelines\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. These guidelines are a combination of 10 objective quantitative indicators (ie, body temperature, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, mean arterial pressure, shock index, respiration rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, peripheral blood glucose, state of consciousness, and pain score), and 48 and 25 common complaints or symptoms seen in priority general patients and trauma patients, respectively. In addition, computer-aided patient triage software通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> was developed to identify patients in need of emergency care. Emergency patients were triaged according to disease severity and were classified as level I (fatal, red), level II (critical, orange), level III (emergency, yellow), level IV (not urgent, green), and level V (non-emergency, blue). Critically ill patients were defined as those with unstable vital signs which were classified as level I and need to be treated immediately. The changes in the medical treatment process before and after the integrated management are shown in Figure 1.\nThe primary outcomes were ED length of stay, cardiopulmonary resuscitation success rate, the resuscitation success rate in emergency and critical patients, time to emergency electrocardiogram (ECG) examination in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI), time to antiplatelet drug administration, the rate of goal time compliance, and treatment success rate. Secondary outcomes were the average daily number of critically ill patients, the number of hospitalizations, the number of central venous catheterization cases and the average daily cost, and the outcomes of patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI. Time to emergency ECG examination was defined as the time from ED entry to completion of the ECG examination. Time to antiplatelet drug administration was defined as the time from ED entry to the administration of oral antiplatelet drugs.\nAs shown in Supplementary Digital Content, Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A782 the resuscitation rate of critically ill patients increased from 73.58% (401 in 545) to 85.32% (1244 in 1458) due to the improvement in the management model. The percentage of patients requiring resuscitation was higher in the observational group than that in the control group: 6.60% (1458 in 22,017) vs. 5.40% (545 in 10,008). The ED length of stay decreased due to a rapid transferring of patients to the general ICU or specialty wards. The percentage of general ICU admissions increased sixfold to 0.48% (105 in 22,017) after the implementation of the integrated management model. Access for patients with key diseases was unimpeded in the observation group, the wait time was significantly shortened, and the medical quality of the treatment process and the total successful rescue rate were significantly improved by effectively standardizing emergency medical staffs’ clinical decision-making in the observation group. The successful rescue rate of acute trauma patients and acute respiratory failure patients was significantly improved (data not shown). Among the MI patients with acute ST-segment elevation, the times to ECG examination and administration of antiplatelet drugs were significantly reduced. The average door-to-balloon (DTB) time and the rate of reaching the standard of the DTB time were comparable.\nCritically ill patients received decisive treatments sooner. Thus, the success rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) increased significantly, similar to that reported previously.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> This progress is the result of several factors, including yearly training of staff in first aid and critical care medicine, and standardized rescue treatment. By developing reliable triage tools, standardizing care procedures for emergency patients, and conserving medical resources for critically ill patients, critically ill patients’ wait times were significantly shortened. This truly reflects the \"emergency\" of the ED. The rescue team shares some responsibilities with the Rapid Response team通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> in critical care medicine and can effectively respond to all kinds of emergencies. In a previous study,通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> emergency treatment and medical safety were improved by formulating standardized clinical management guidelines based on the best available evidence. Therefore, we created standardized emergency care procedures for key diseases, which significantly improved the successful rescue rate of acute trauma, acute respiratory failure, and acute ST-segment elevation MI patients, and the DTB time met the DTB Alliance requirements.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> However, our rate of emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was lower than that reported in a previous study,通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> which may be due to the lack of adequate healthcare human resources needed to implement an emergent PCI. Overall, the standardized care procedures for key diseases effectively simplified the intermediate link and effectively shortened the treatment duration. This ensured the continuity and standardization of treatment and provided quick, efficient, and safe medical services.\nThrough triaging, most critically ill patients can be screened, and treatment priority can be fairly determined. However, some emergency patients are not well informed about their condition or are dishonest and misreport their main symptoms or complaints, leading to over-triage or under-triage. Undoubtedly, standardized training can help improve the comprehensive first aid skills of emergency physicians. Unfortunately, not every emergency physician is willing to engage in this continued education outside of work. The learning process is long and boring and may dissuade physicians from completing the training. Ensuring this training is completed requires the active coordination of the management department as well as policies, job qualifications, and income distributions that promote emergency physicians to actively engage in learning. In addition, the implementation of the intervention also requires emergency patients to be compliant with reasonable requests from medical staff. Some patients may be reluctant to cooperate for various reasons, which may lead to inadequate intervention. This can be circumvented through continuous health education that is coordinated by the management department.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}
{"seq_id": "1a3456c5-1e75-4fdd-8f20-b5c522146a90", "title": "", "text": "【0】Due to the development of the country’s economy, accelerated aging population, and the rising incidence and prevalence of various chronic non-communicable diseases caused by unhealthy lifestyles are increasing challenges facing China. Also, the healthcare reform over the past 10-years has widely covered the basic medical insurance of China, people’s demands for medical services are increasing leading to a large number of patients pouring into major large tertiary hospitals. Although these large hospitals continue to expand their size and beds, due to the limited staffing, hospitals turn out to extend the working hours of medical staff and shorten patients’ conversation time with their doctors, which result in an increasing workload of medical staff, making many of them over worked and potential burnout. Overwork not only damages the health of medical staff, but also affects the relationship between doctors and patients, and may adversely affect medical quality and safety通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3]</u>.\nIn order to improve the quality of medical services and residents’ medical experience, and increase patients satisfaction and people’s sense of gain, in January 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (now the National and Health Commission,NHC) and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) issued the Three-year Action Plan of the \"China National Healthcare Improvement Initiative (CNHII,2015—2017)\" . Subsequently, the two agencies launched the second stage of CNHII通用删除7(英):<u>(2018—2020)</u> in December 2017.\nIn order to evaluate the implementation of CNHII in China’s major tertiary public hospitals objectively and promote the continuous improvement of medical services, the National Health Commission entrusted the School of Public Health Peking Union Medical College to lead provincial experts to implement the China Healthcare Improvement Evaluation Survey(CHIES) covering 31 provinces. In the initial survey design, we not only evaluated the satisfaction of medical institutions and patients, but also added an annual survey among doctors and nurses including questions on their workload and job satisfaction. This study focuses on analyzing the proportion of medical professionals in the sample hospitals who feel overworked, and provides references for improving the situation of medical staff’s workload.\nThe data of our study is from the first to the fourth surveys of medical professionals for \"the China Healthcare Improvement Evaluation Survey(CHIES) 通用删除7(英):<u>(2016—2019)</u>\" . The fourth survey(conducted in March 2019) targeted at medical workers of 144 tertiary public hospitals in 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, including 94 provincial general hospitals,43 NHC - affiliated hospitals(affiliated to the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China) and 7 hospitals under direct management of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine(NATCM). A total of 55,476 questionnaires were collected, of which 25,700 were from doctors and 29,776 from nurses. After cleaning the data, 53,439 valid questionnaires were obtained, of which 24,529 were from doctors and 28,910 from nurses.\nPlease see Wu Y N et al通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>Survey on the self-rated health of doctors and nurses at Chin ' s144 tertiary public hospitals for sampling method and on-site survey\nThe questionnaire used the item of \"I feel that I am currently work overload\" to measure the medical staff’s awareness of the current workload. The answer option was set to Likert 5 scale, with strongly agree = 5, agree= 4, general = 3, disagree = 2, strongly disagree = 1; the responses: \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" were defined as consent; \"general\" defined as general; \"disagree\" and \"strongly disagree\" were defined as disagree.\nThe survey collected data through the WeChat public account background, then imported it into Excel and analyzed it with SPSS 25.0 statistical software. Composition ratio(%) was used in the descriptive analysis.\nDuring March, 2019, a total of 53,439 questionnaires were collected from the 144 survey hospitals, including 24,529 doctors and 28,910 nurses. Among the doctors, 59.1% were female and 40.9% were male. The age was concentrated on 30~39(51.7%) . The proportion of mid-carrier doctors was 37.0%, followed by 34.0% with senior title. The highest academic qualification of the doctors was mainly postgraduate, accounting for 72.8%. Among nurses, female accounted for the majority, 97%. Nurses aged 30~39 accounted for 44.0%. The highest academic qualifications of nurse were mainly undergraduate, accounting for 75.6%. The proportion of nurses with primary title accounted for the majority, 66.0%, followed by 29.3% with middle title.\nAccording to the results of the fourth survey （Table1）, 62.6% of doctors felt that they were currently overloaded. In terms of the gender of the doctors, men(67.2%) who thought that workload was too heavy was higher than women(59.4%). The higher the doctor’s educational degree and professional title, the higher proportion of them feeling overloaded in work. The proportion of doctors working in the western region(66.4%) who felt that they are overworked was higher than that in central region(62.6%) and eastern region(59.6%) . Doctors in different departments all felt that their workload was too high, among which the highest was internal medicine(66.6%), followed by pediatrics(66.3%) and surgery(65.0 %).\nDifferent social-demographic characteristics of medical staff to self-perceived overwork\n删除重复语句：<u>Different social-demographic characteristics of medical staff to self-perceived overwork</u>\n44.0% of nurses felt that current work was overloaded. In terms of the gender of the nurse, more men (53.1%) felt that workload was too heavy than women(43.7%). The proportion of nurses who felt overworked was slightly different with different education background and professional titles. The proportion of nurses in the western region(49.9%) who felt that they were overworked was higher than those in the central region(43.0%) and the eastern region(39.6%). The proportion of nurses in different departments who felt that the workload was too heavy was about 40%, which was not significantly different.\nComparing the results of the survey of 136 tertiary public hospitals which were evaluated for four consecutive years, we found that the proportion of medical staff who felt that they were overworked had not changed much. During the four years, the proportion of people who considered themselves overworked remained at around 62% among the doctors and about 40% among the nurses. One exception is that the proportion of self-reported overworked in 2017 was apparently higher than other three evaluations in both doctors and nurses. This phenomenon might be due to a CCTV news coverage titled \"high drug prices under high rebates\" right in the middle of the second survey period in December 2016. The report pointed out that many pharmaceutical companies paid drug rebates to tertiary hospital doctors. But the report only unilaterally criticized the doctors and reported the government’s administrative punishment of specific doctors and hospitals, without in-depth analysis of the historical reasons behind the phenomenon. Our findings at the country’s major tertiary hospitals possibly reflected the negative feedback from both doctors and nurses during that time 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\nThe survey results showed that 63% of the doctors felt that their current work were overloaded and the proportion was higher than nurses. Similar results were reported by some other studies in China, though with a much smaller scales. For instance, Wang Li et al通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> investigated the situation of medical staff in 9 provinces and found that 60.5% of medical staff believed that the biggest source of work pressure was \"heavy workload\" .\nAs for the subgroups, our evaluation in 2019 has found the following phenomena: First, with the increase of academic rank and professional titles, the proportion of doctors feeling excessive workload was on the rise. The proportion of nurses with middle and senior titles who have overworked was slightly higher than junior nurses. The reason may be that doctors need to assume dual tasks-the consultation of outpatients and management of inpatients. Research showed that as the level of hospitals, professional titles, and the age of doctors increased, the more patients they need to see and manage every day, and the heavier the workload they felt通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u>. In addition, senior doctors as the backbone of the hospital need to undertake more scientific research and teaching work, which indirectly leads to a higher proportion of self-perceived workload.\nSecond, the proportion of doctors and nurses who felt overworked in the western region was higher than those in the central and eastern region. At present, there is an uneven distribution of medical resources in our country, and a shortage of human resources in the western region, which lead to the overburden of medical staff in the western region.\nThird, the proportion of internal medicine and pediatric medical staff who felt that the overworked was higher than those from other departments. This is related to the work characteristics of different department. Internal medicine doctors and nurses have a heavy task of caring for patients, and they need to deal with them in time in the face of complex and critical illnesses. Pediatric patients' family members have high expectations for patient care and treatment, imposing heavier workload and pressure on the medical staff. such characteristics of different departments affect the proportion of internal and pediatric medical staff on their self-perceived workload.\nThe main reasons that medical staff feel their workload is too heavy are occupational characteristics such as high pressure, high intensity and long working hours. Studies通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u> showed that one-third of the medical staff in China worked more than 10 hours a day, and the long working hours of medical staff have become a common phenomenon. In order to meet the needs of patients, hospitals generally adopt a 24-hour duty system, and more and more hospitals created \"no holiday hospitals\" which would increase the workload of medical staff. At the same time, the insufficient number of medical staff is also the main reason for the heavy workload and the overworking of medical staff. Some studies have shown that 42.5% of doctors believed that hospitals were under-equipped and 90.5% of nurses believed that the number of nurses was lacking通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Current research showed that excessive workload would lead to a decrease in job satisfaction通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>, large workload, and job burnout. It also affected the physical and mental health of medical staff as well as medical quality and safety通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In our four consecutive evaluations, the proportion of doctors who felt that their workload was too heavy maintained at about 62%. Therefore, reducing the workload of medical staff should be prioritized by relevant departments.\nFacing heavy work load of medical tasks and high work pressure, the good mood of medical staff contributes to their own health and the completion of medical tasks通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In view of the current situation of the overworking of the medical staff, we make the following recommendations:\nFirst, the government should put in place corresponding measures to effectively reduce the workload of medical staff in major tertiary hospitals, appropriately allocate human resources, and accelerate the implementation of coordinated, integrated and connected primary-tertiary care. Appropriate diversion of different needs of patients should be achieved according to the patient’s disease severity to relieve the workload and pressure of the medical staff in tertiary hospitals.\nSecond, hospitals should establish an assessment and incentive mechanism that is scientific and efficient, and care for both the physical and mental health of the medical professionals. In addition to improving their salaries and benefits, other measures should be considered, such as protecting their legitimate rights, paid leave and adequate rest lounges to enhance their overall wellbeing and enthusiasm, and reduce the pressure of medical personnel on excessive workload from the psychological level. The working hours of medical staff should be appropriately arranged. Meanwhile, for the departments and positions with heavier workload, the number of staff should be increased in arranging shifts.\nFinally, it is recommended that relevant departments should conduct in-depth investigations and researches on the main causes and characteristics of excessive workload of medical staff, and take effective measures to reduce the workload of medical staff, in the aim of improving the employment experience of the medical staff.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

She was evaluated with a chest computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed a 16 mm × 14 mm nodule close to pleura with a well-defined margin in the superior segment of the right lower lobe 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A and 1B]</u>. No distant metastatic lesions or enlarged lymph nodes were observed. Then, CT scan also identified that all organs inside the thoracic and abdomen were inversely positioned 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C and 1D]</u>. SIT was diagnosed by these findings. Otherwise, head and neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were performed and no lesion was observed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1E and 1F]</u>. And emission computed tomography (ECT) was also obtained and no bony metastasis was found.\nPercutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (PTNB) was used for the pathological diagnosis of the nodule. Microscopically, individual tumor or well-defined nests of tumor cells, large polygonal undifferentiated epithelial cells with oval and pleomorphic nuclei, were surrounded by abundant lymphocytes and plasmacytes in the stroma 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A and 2B]</u>.

Meanwhile, EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) by in situ hybridization was positive for neoplastic cells as well 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2D]</u>. Based on these histological findings, the nodule was diagnosed as primary pulmonary LELC. According to CT and MRI findings, the pathological stage was T1N0M0.\nAfter successful surgical treatment without adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy, no recurrence and complication were observed at follow-up of more than 2 years.\nSIT, a rare condition of abnormal visceral rotation, denoting complete inversion of thoracic and abdominal viscera.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u> Since the technical challenges that orientation is more complicated and requires more surgery wise in surgical processes, SIT continues to be interesting and noteworthy in the surgical realm.\nLELC is a rare malignant tumor. It was reported that nasopharynx is the most common site.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> According to the reports, LELC can also occur in the extra-nasopharynx organs, such as lacrimal gland, lung, skin, and bladder.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,3]</u> It is estimated that pulmonary LELC accounts for only 0.9% of all primary lung cancers.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Some studies found that pulmonary LELC is more common in Asians than in Westerners.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,3]</u> Furthermore, the mean age of pulmonary LELC was reported to be 10 years younger.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> It is believed that the prognosis of pulmonary LELC is better.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Therefore, the incidence of primary pulmonary LELC with SIT is extremely rare.\nSeveral studies figured out a close relationship between EBV infection and pulmonary LELC.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,3]</u> Normally, for further distinguishing pulmonary LELC from other types of lung cancer, EBV infection evidence should be collected. In our case, in situ hybridization with EBER positive was observed in some malignant cells 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2D]</u>.\nPathologically, pulmonary LELC was close to undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The characteristics of the histological findings in primary pulmonary LELC represents the large polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasmic and indistinct cell boundaries, individual tumor or well-defined nests of tumor cells surrounding with abundant lymphocytes and plasmacytes.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Massive lymphocytes infiltration in tumor may suggest the enhanced or robust immunological response, indirectly indicating a better prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> In our case, both typical tumor cells and extensive lymphocytes and plasmacytes infiltration were observed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A and 2B]</u>. Additionally, pulmonary LELC needed to be differentiated from non-Hodgkin lymphoma and meta-static nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Based on the disease stage of this case, video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed, without additional chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

After detection of microbial products or cytosolic danger signals, most canonical inflammasome sensors oligomerize and recruit an adaptor protein called apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC). This results in the formation of inflammasome specks, within which ASC recruits and activates the inflammatory caspase-1. Subsequently, active caspase-1 promotes processing and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. Active caspase-1 also cleaves gasdermin D, leading to pyroptosis, a type of programmed cell death.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u>\nSeveral inflammasome sensors have been directly or indirectly implicated in the response to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, such as NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), interferon inducible protein 16 (IFI16), and caspase recruitment domain family member 8 (CARD8).通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6,7]</u> However, the specific contribution of each inflammasome to HIV-1 pathogenesis and treatment is still poorly understood. In this review, we summarize potential mechanisms of inflammasome activation during the course of HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, we discuss the critical role of inflammasome activation in HIV-1 pathogenesis and its therapeutic implications.\nCD4+ T cell loss during chronic HIV-1 infection is a hallmark of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. The molecular mechanisms of CD4+ T cell depletion during HIV-1 infection are not fully understood. It is generally believed that chronic immune activation, rather than viral protein cytotoxicity, causes CD4+ T cell loss and HIV-1 pathogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9,10]</u> Moreover, several species of African nonhuman primates do not experience CD4+ T cell depletion despite chronic infection with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) and high levels of viral replication. One explanation for the resistance of natural SIV hosts to SIV-associated CD4+ T cell loss may be that they do not develop features of chronic immune activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13]</u> However, the mechanisms through which chronic immune activation may be linked to CD4+ T cell depletion have not been elucidated. Notably, one study showed that abortive HIV infection triggers pyroptosis of resting CD4+ T cells, contributing to HIV-1 pathogenesis by depletion of most CD4+ T cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Inflammasome activation also leads to the release of certain cytokines that may contribute to chronic immune activation,通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> although whether this plays a role in the progression to AIDS remains to be determined. Furthermore, what role the inflammasome plays in adaptive immune responses during HIV-1 infection warrants further study.\nRecent studies have identified cytosolic inflammasome sensors that recognize nucleic acids and protein components associated with or generated from HIV-1 infection. The inflammasome sensors currently known to be involved in HIV-1 infection include NLRP3, IFI16, CARD8, and other inflammasomes 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1, Figure 1]</u>.\nInflammasome sensor for HIV-1\n删除重复语句：<u>Inflammasome sensor for HIV-1</u>\nNLRP3: NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 3; IFI16: Interferon-inducible protein 16; CARD8: Caspase recruitment domain family member 8; NLRP1: NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 1; NLRC4: NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4; AIM2: Absent in melanoma 2; HIV-1: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; PBMC: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell; DC: Dendritic cells; MDM: Monocyte-derived macrophage.\nNLRP3 is one of the most broadly studied inflammasome sensors and has the potential to sense a diverse set of ligands. The NLRP3 inflammasome may be activated by various stimuli including cytosolic K+ efflux, cytosolic Ca2+ influx, or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS).通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> NLRP3 inflammasome activation results in caspase-1-dependent IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, as well as gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,33,34]</u>\nNLRP3 inflammasome activation by HIV-1 in monocytes and macrophages has been thoroughly studied. It has been proposed that viral RNA may trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition, previous studies suggest that HIV-1 infection promotes pro-IL-1β expression via Toll-like receptor 8 and then induces IL-1β production through the NLRP3 inflammasome in monocytes, macrophages, and microglia cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,19,20]</u> More recently, it has also been reported that transfection of dendritic cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells with HIV-1 single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) results in protein kinase R activation and downstream IL-1β production via NLRP3 inflammasome activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> These studies suggest that HIV-1 RNA may trigger the generation of ROS or the release of protease cathepsin B through different mechanisms, contributing to NLRP3 activation. However, the specific HIV-1 transcript required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation during HIV-1 infection still remains unclear. It should also be noted that transfection of ssRNA may have limited in vivo relevance, as it is different from natural HIV infection that ssRNA is typically not exposed in the incoming viral particle because of protection by the capsid coating.通用删除6(英):<u>[35,36]</u> In addition, HIV-1 infection triggers NLRP3 and NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation in monocyte-derived macrophages.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> This suggests that IL-1β induction by HIV-1 viral protein U is regulated through the NLRP3 inflammasome, whereas IL-18 release by HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 is regulated via the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Furthermore, many studies have reported NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia, which has been implicated in HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders. Multiple viral proteins have been described for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia, including envelope glycoprotein gp120, transactivator of transcription (Tat), and viral protein R.通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23,24,25]</u> For instance, transfection of HIV-gp120 or Tat into microglia triggers NLRP3 activation and IL-1β production. Gp120 mediates NF-κB activation, which upregulates NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β levels, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome through K+ efflux. By contrast, Tat activates NLRP3 by inhibiting miR-223 degradation of NLRP3.\nAlthough HIV-1 can infect macrophages and microglia, which are associated with neurocognitive disorders,通用删除6(英):<u>[37,38,39,40]</u> CD4+ T cells are the major targets of HIV-1 infection. Importantly, resting memory CD4+ T cells make up the latent reservoir during HIV-1 infection.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> Several previous studies have provided evidence in support of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in CD4+ T cells during chronic HIV infection.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u> It has recently been reported that NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a critical role in mediating the loss of CD4+T cells in people living with HIV (PLHIV).通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> In this study, Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> evaluated active caspase-1 and caspase-3 level in CD4+ T cells from HIV-negative individuals, PLHIV who are viremic, PLHIV on antiretroviral therapy, and elite controllers. They observed that both apoptosis and pyroptosis occurred in CD4+ T cells from PLHIV. More importantly, the authors demonstrated the contribution of the NLRP3 inflammasome to pyroptosis of CD4+ T cells through ROS production, which is a predominant pathway for CD4+ T cell loss during chronic HIV-1 infection.\nTogether, these studies reveal that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in HIV-1 targeted cells; however, exactly how NLRP3 senses HIV-1 and the key host factors that regulate NLRP3 activation in response to HIV-1 infection remain to be fully elucidated.\nIFI16 is a member of the interferon-inducible PYHIN protein family and includes a pyrin domain and two DNA-binding hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear (HIN) domains 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> IFI16 has been described to act as a restriction factor for viral DNA by inducing STING-dependent interferon production, resulting in restriction of DNA virus and lentivirus replication.通用删除6(英):<u>[42,43]</u> IFI16 has also been reported as an inflammasome sensor that can sense viral DNA, leading to ASC-dependent inflammasome activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45]</u>\nIn HIV-1, caspase-1 activation is implicated in cellular responses to abortive HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues, indicating that inflammasome signaling plays an important role in CD4+ T cell loss and progression to AIDS. It has been proposed that, in abortive HIV-1 infection of quiescent tonsillar CD4+ T cells, incomplete HIV-1 reverse transcription products accumulate and are sensed by IFI16, which triggers caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,28]</u> However, IFI16 is unable to sense abortive HIV-1 infection in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells,通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in capsase-1 activation by HIV-1 in nonlymphoid resident CD4+ T cells. Notably, IFI16 can bind to and inhibit Sp1, a host transcription factor, thus suppressing HIV-1 gene expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> Thus, further studies are warranted to elucidate the confounding role of IFI16 in HIV-1 sensing and viral gene expression.\nCARD8 contains an N-terminal unstructured region followed by a function-to-find domain and a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). CARD8 undergoes autoproteolytic processing between the ZU5 (found in ZO-1 and UNC5) and UPA (conserved in UNC5, PIDD, and ankyrins) subdomains of the function-to-find domain, which results in two noncovalently associated polypeptide chains: N terminal and C terminal fragments 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u> The dipeptidyl peptidase 8/9 inhibitor Val-boroPro (VbP) was shown to induce degradation of the N-terminal fragments in acute myeloid leukima-derived cell lines in a proteasome-dependent manner.通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u> This results in the release of the C-terminal UPA-CARD domains and formation of the CARD8 inflammasome. DPP9 suppresses CARD8 activation through sequestration of the C-terminal fragment. Treatment with VbP results in CARD8 inflammasome activation because VbP induces N-terminal degradation and inhibits C-terminal fragment capture, resulting in disruption of the DPP9-ternary complex.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> Importantly, CARD8 has been shown to play a role in inflammasome activation and pyroptosis of resting CD4+ T cells through DPP9 inhibition.通用删除6(英):<u>[52,53]</u>\nWe recently reported that HIV-1 protease can directly cleave the N-terminus of CARD8, creating an unstable neo-N-terminus. The neo-N-terminus is targeted for proteasomal degradation, upon which the bioactive C-terminal fragment is released. This leads to inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 recruitment and activation, and pyroptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> In HIV-1-infected cells, the viral protease remains in an inactive state as a subunit of the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor. We found that premature activation of intracellular HIV-1 protease by nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) triggers CARD8 inflammasome activation and mediates killing of HIV-infected macrophages and CD4+ T cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>\nAs HIV-1 protease directly activates CARD8 in both macrophages and CD4+ T cells, it will be of interest to investigate how the host regulates CARD8 inflammasome activation and whether natural HIV-1 infection can activate CARD8. Furthermore, unlike the other inflammasome sensors that have been identified and characterized in macrophages, burgeoning evidence shows that the CARD8 inflammasome can be activated in T cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[29,52,53]</u> Further studies are needed to better understand and compare the physiological role of CARD8 in T cells and macrophages.\nSome studies have demonstrated that other inflammasomes might also have an impact on HIV-1 infection, such as NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 1 (NLRP1), NLR family CARD domain-containing 4 (NLRC4), and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2). Several groups have demonstrated that NLRP1 expression is associated with CD4+ T cell loss.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u> NLRC4 has been reported to play a role in dendritic cells from PLHIV and also in monocyte-derived macrophages during HIV-1 infection.通用删除6(英):<u>[21,54]</u> Furthermore, increased AIM2 expression has been reported in the course of HIV-1 infection.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,32]</u> Nonetheless, the strong supporting evidence for activation of these inflammasomes warrants further study of their action during the course of HIV-1 infection.\nDespite antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively suppressing HIV-1 in PLHIV, ART cannot eliminate HIV-1-infected cells, allowing lifelong persistence of HIV-1 latent reservoirs. This reservoir of latently infected resting CD4+ T cells is the major barrier to a functional HIV cure.通用删除6(英):<u>[41,55,56,57]</u> Inspired by the results from animal model studies and a few clinical cases of HIV cures, several strategies have been proposed for HIV cure research, including cell and gene therapy, targeting the provirus by enhancing the function of immune cell.通用删除6(英):<u>[58,59]</u> One strategy for HIV-1 latent reservoir eradication called \"shock-and-kill,\" involves induction of HIV-1 expression using latency reversing agents (LRAs), allowing latently infected cells to be exposed to viral cytopathic effects or clearance by the immune system.通用删除6(英):<u>[60,61]</u> However, LRAs alone are insufficient to induce cell death.通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63,64]</u> Thus, additional approaches to eliminate the latent reservoir are needed. We recently reported that targeting the CARD8 inflammasome may be a viable strategy to eliminate residual HIV-1-infected cells. We showed that premature activation of intracellular HIV-1 protease by NNRTI triggers CARD8 sensing and pyroptosis of HIV-infected macrophages and CD4+ T cells. In this study, we targeted an immutable component of viral protease function, which induced cell killing independent of apoptosis. More importantly, we found that CARD8 can recognize all subtypes of HIV-1 despite substantial viral diversity, which overcomes the challenge of the breadth of adaptive immune responses since the adaptive immune system only recognizes conserved epitopes.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>\nHowever, it is worth noting that there are at least two factors that may affect the strategy of targeting the CARD8 inflammasome. First, cells harboring transcriptionally silent HIV-1 do not express Gag-Pol, so potent LRAs are required to induce viral gene expression. Second, the clinically relevant concentration of NNRTIs may be suboptimal to trigger cell killing. Thus, more potent Gag-Pol dimerizers or drugs for sensitization of the CARD8 inflammasome are needed for this strategy. Based on this concept, our group recently found that DPP9 inhibition reduces the threshold concentration of NNRTIs needed to trigger pyroptosis in HIV-infected cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> Another major obstacle for targeting the inflammasome for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is cytokine release during inflammasome activation. However, it is generally accepted that CD4+ T cells do not secrete the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β or IL-18. Moreover, the frequency of latently infected CD4+ T cells of PLHIV on ART is approximately 1 in 105 to 108 total CD4+ T cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> Thus, CARD8-mediated pyroptosis of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells in PLHIV is not likely to cause excessive inflammation. Nonetheless, cytokine secretion of tissue macrophage reservoirs of HIV should be considered.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u>\nIt has been shown that targeting caspase-1 via specific inhibitor VX-765 can prevent lymphoid CD4+ T cell death, suggesting that blocking pyroptosis may be a therapeutic option to prevent CD4+ T cell loss.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> In addition, because NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia has been implicated in HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders and other related complications, the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome may be a promising direction to alleviate chronic inflammation.\nMuch has been learned about the interface between the inflammasome and HIV-1 infection in the past few years. This information demonstrates the role of inflammasome activation in HIV-1 pathogenesis and treatment. Nonetheless, several fundamental questions have yet to be answered. For instance, the exact ligand and mechanisms that activate NLRP3- and IFI16-mediated inflammasomes and which cell types they function within are still unknown. Moreover, more detailed studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate inflammasome functions. Investigating these questions will be key to informing the development of therapeutic strategies for the management and prevention of HIV-1 infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

It occurs in 1.4% of ectopic pregnancies and carries a mortality rate of 5.1/1000 cases, 7.7 times higher compared with nonabdominal ectopic pregnancies. This study aimed to present a case of a live 14-week primary hepatic ectopic pregnancy diagnosed using ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and managed using laparoscopic microsurgery.\nA 21-year-old Chinese female patient, who had never been married and pregnant, was 14 weeks pregnant as determined from the date of her last menstrual period. She presented with a 1-day history of minor vaginal bleeding and a positive urine pregnancy test, without abdominal pain or emesis. The patient’s serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level changed from 135,755.00 U/L to 179,361.60 U/L after 2 days. A 14-mm thin endometrial stripe with no definite intrauterine gestational sac was revealed by a transvaginal pelvic ultrasound scan. Except 63 U/L alanine transaminase and 40 U/L aspartate aminotransferase, other routine blood tests, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, amylase and glucose, and gallbladder tests, were normal. An ultrasound examination of the right upper quadrant revealed a live 14-week fetus attached to the undersurface of the left hepatic lobe 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u>. A CT plain scan performed between the left liver and gallbladder displayed a low-density shadow, approximately 8.2 cm × 4.8 cm × 6.9 cm, with a 7 cm fetus in the middle 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b]</u>.

It revealed an irregular cyst, approximately 9.2 cm × 8.6 cm × 5.3 cm, with a 7 cm fetus, exerting pressure on the left portal vein 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1c]</u>. The placenta, including the border, was approximately 2.5 cm thick.

Intraoperatively, no pelvic or abdominal hemorrhage was noted. The uterus was slightly enlarged, and a residual horn of the uterus was seen on the left side measuring approximately 2 cm × 2 cm × 1 cm. Both ovaries and fallopian tubes appeared normal. The liver surface was smooth, and the left liver was enlarged and hyperemic. The liver was cut off the ligament, and the inside of the left hepatic lobe was exposed. A transverse incision of about 3 cm to the left was made on the inner surface of the liver. The amniotic sac was visible and measured approximately 9 cm × 6 cm × 6 cm. When amniotic fluid was drained out of the sac, a long fetus (approximately 12 cm) was delivered without any difficulty 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1e]</u>. Stripping the placenta and the left hepatic lobe resulted in massive hemorrhage in the patient (2000 ml). Bleeding was ultimately controlled by rapid suture and transfusion. Postoperative pathology verified the primary hepatic ectopic pregnancy 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1f]</u>. The serum hCG level decreased to 45,674.20 U/L 24 h after surgery. One week after the operation, the serum hCG level was 15,590.20 U/L. Ultrasound scans of the liver revealed the absence of an intrauterine gestational sac, normal adnexa, and no evidence of residual ectopic tissue. Serial serum hCG levels at the outpatient follow-up normalized to <10 U/L.\nThe occurrence of primary hepatic pregnancy is exceptionally rare. Of the only 22 cases reported (based on PubMed database search) till date, only 29% progressed beyond the first trimester.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Easily missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis due to an onset of the disease is rare. Careful observations and the analysis of patients’ clinical data by measuring hCG levels and using ultrasound, CT, and MRI make the preoperative diagnosis easy. A guided MRI is significant to the operation because it can scan the placental implantation.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Immediate surgical laparotomy and hepatic lobectomy have been the techniques for the traditional management of primary hepatic pregnancy due to increasing risks of maternal mortality as the pregnancy progresses.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Almost all primary hepatic pregnancies were successfully managed surgically in a previous study, but one patient succumbed to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Previous reports on hepatic pregnancies have suggested nonsurgical alternatives, including selective embolization of placental vessels and administration of parenteral methotrexate. Laparoscopic surgery is a more effective alternative to laparotomy with the development of minimally invasive surgery. Chin and colleagues surgically managed the first reported case of a primary hepatic pregnancy using laparoscopy alone in Singapore.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Laparoscopy has a large number of benefits for patients, including shortened operation times, less intraoperative blood loss, lower analgesic requirements, shorter hospital stays, fewer peritoneal adhesions, and shorter convalescence, compared with laparotomy. Therefore, managing primary hepatic ectopic pregnancy using laparoscopy microsurgery might serve as a more acceptable option.\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

Localisation of aortic injuries was analysed in several surgical and radiological series. Aortic disruptions can occur in all segments of the aorta: 92% of aortic injuries occur at the isthmus with 3% occurring in the ascending aorta, 4% in the arch and 1% involving the distal descending aorta.1 This is in contrast to autopsy series where 65% of injuries occur at the aortic isthmus, 14% in the ascending aorta and arch, 12% in the distal descending aorta and 9% in the abdominal aorta.2 This means that ascending aortic injuries are not so rare but are quite immediately lethal. The lesion types were classified according to the three layers of the arterial wall involvement, a full thickness involvement was defined as transection or rupture, while the intima/media lesion was defined as tear. Most of transections occur at isthmus level, instead ascending aorta is more frequently the site of tears, and ascending aorta rupture usually fatal.1 Therefore, here we describe a quite infrequent presentation, with rare location and rare type of the aortic injury.\nA 31 years old man without significant medical history was involved in a motor vehicle accident, being run over by a car while riding his motorbike. He sustained a cranial and facial trauma with complete avulsion of dental arches and, still conscious, was intubated on the scene for airway protection and then transferred to our emergency department. The patient underwent total body computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed a contained rupture of ascending aorta . Associated lesions included multiple maxillary fractures, left ulna fracture and D4-5 vertebral fracture.\nEmergency surgery was indicated. Median sternotomy was performed. Opening the pericardium revealed a transversal full thickness aortic rupture originating above the right coronary artery ostium and extended to the pulmonary artery facing aortic wall about 2 cm distal to the sinotubular junction . The circumferential full thickness involvement of the aortic wall was not complete, with the posterior and right lateral ascending aortic wall spared.\nCardiopulmonary bypass was instituted through femoral artery cannulation and central venous cannulation. The aorta was opened just above the sinotubular junction in circulatory arrest and cold hematic cardioplegia was administered through the coronary ostia. The aortic lesion was confined to the proximal portion of ascending aorta, not involving aortic arch and this allowed a safe aortic cross clamp, after a 3 min deep hypothermic circulatory arrest necessary for dividing the aorta from the pulmonary artery. Aortic valve was tricuspid, morphologically normal and competent. Resection of the injured segment and replacement with 26 mm tubular Dacron graft was performed without complications. The distal and proximal anastomoses were completed during aortic cross clamping without circulatory arrest.\nOn post-operative day three, the patient underwent maxillofacial surgery for Le Fort type II and III fracture. His postoperative course was complicated by superficial sternal wound dehiscence, resolved by 25th postoperative day. He suffered papilledema and otorrhagia as consequences of head trauma. Due to complex maxillofacial surgeries, the patient needed to be fed by nasogastric feeding tube (NFT) until 29th post-operative day. Postoperative control CT scan was performed  and patient was discharged home on 35th postoperative day.\nTraumatic aortic injuries represent one of the leading causes of death after motor vehicle accidents, and it has been widely understood how prompt diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial for the prognosis. About the aortic injury mechanism in thoracic blunt traumas, two main theories have been proposed. First, the displacement of the aorta in a cranial or caudal direction, due to deceleration, can cause tears at the isthmus, because of the traction exercised by surrounding fixed structures: the ligamentum arteriosum, the left main stem bronchus and the paired intercostal arteries. Second, the theory is that hydrostatic pressure rapidly elevates at impact due to deceleration forces, chest compression, occlusion of aortic diaphragmatic hiatus (working as a cross clamp), producing a 'water hammer’ effect, which added to the catecholamines release, generates a huge pressure raise and the aorta bursts and tears at its weakest points.删除4：<u>3</u>\nThis was the most probable mechanism in our case. Considering that the patient was hit and overrun by a car, deceleration and chest compression both were determined. Direct \"extern\" lesion of the aorta could be excluded since no other thoracic injuries, sternal or ribs fracture occurred.\nFinally, about treatment, a great leap forward dealing with BTAI was made thanks to endovascular strategies, which allows safe exclusion of aortic lesion, avoiding the risks of open surgery and full heparinization in polytrauma patients.4 Unfortunately, this is true only for isthmus or distal lesions, while, in case of arch or ascending aorta involvement, conventional surgery must be preferred. Even if the direct suture of the transection is described,5 we preferred the complete replacement of the ascending aorta, due to the haemorrhagic infarction of the aortic wall surrounding the lesion and we advise to always perform complete replacement when feasible, removing all the weakened tissue.\nNil.\nThe institutional ethical committee have approved this study.\nAll authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.11.001</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

This is accomplished by the selective activation of cell type-specific patterns of gene expression. Protein coding sequences comprise a very small fraction of mammalian genomes, approximately 1.5% in humans.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Embedded in the large swaths of intervening sequence is a wealth of information that specifies cell type specific gene expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> These intergenic information repositories are known as enhancers,通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u> which can regulate the expression of their target genes at megabase distances, and are in some instances separated from target genes by several other genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> The distance over which enhancers can act appears to be limited by the existence of topological-associated domains, which are megabase-sized chromatin regions that are insulated from surrounding chromatin.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Under normal conditions, enhancers are unable to affect gene expression of genes lying outside of such domains.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8]</u>\nDNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) are the primary \"readers\" of this information. Cell identity and function are specified by the combined actions of TFs, which can be crudely classified as lineage-determining TFs (LDTFs) and signal-dependent TFs (SDTFs—see Ref. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> for a more complete classification).通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u> LDTFs typically show a very restricted pattern of expression, while SDTFs are more ubiquitous, but only active in the presence of a specific signal. TFs bind cooperatively to DNA to promote cell-type and cell-state specific gene expression. Critically, SDTFs and LDTFs cooperate to activate gene expression,通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> meaning that the signals to which a cell is exposed can alter the function of LDTFs (e.g. from promoting self-renewal to promoting differentiation通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>), while, the collection of LDTFs expressed in a cell profoundly affect the gene expression output of a given signal通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u> .\nOnce cell type-specific gene expression programs are established, barriers inhibit cell type interconversion. In the mid-1900s, Conrad Waddington presented the concept of \"canalization\" to describe the specification of different cell types, which remains resonant in the molecular era.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> In his conceptualization, a marble is placed on the top of a hill, representing the totipotent state. As this marble rolls down the hill, it encounters various forks, representing alternate cell fates. As it continues down a given canal, it may encounter additional fate choices, until it finally reaches a minimum, achieving a stable fate. This concept was prescient, as it envisioned epigenetic barriers separating alternative cell fates, analogized in the form of the barrier separating 2 canals.\nMore recently, the molecular basis of the barrier between cell identities has become clear. The most conspicuous of these barriers revolves around the fact that eukaryotic DNA is packaged around histone proteins to form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes form a natural impediment to the DNA binding of most TFs, and provide an important basis for cooperation between TFs. While an individual TF may have difficulty competing with a histone octamer for binding to its cognate DNA sequence, when motifs for several TFs are present within the same nucleosome-bound DNA fragment, coexpression of these TFs allows cooperative eviction of nucleosomes resulting in chromatin opening, the first step in enhancer activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,9]</u> This form of cooperation often requires the activity of ATP-dependent histone remodeling complexes such as the SWI/SNF complex that, when recruited by TFs, help to evict nucleosomes and facilitate binding of cooperating factors.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Histones can also be posttranslationally modified in numerous ways that contribute to activation or repression of transcription.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> TFs work in concert with factors that modify both the histone proteins and DNA itself to lock in cell identity, contributing to the barrier between cell fates (canals) envisioned by Waddington.\nThe barriers between most pairs of cell types are never breached without experimental intervention, the most famous example of which is the reprogramming of fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells by a cocktail of 4 TFs.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> That said, in some settings cell identity conversion can occur. A common form of cell identity change in human tissues is known as metaplasia, in which 1 cell type is replaced by another cell type in a given tissue. Metaplasia often results from injury, and can be enhanced by an accompanying inflammatory response.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> In some tissues, including the pancreas, metaplasia is a major pre-cancerous state. Metaplasia can occur through direct conversion of 1 cell type to another, and usually occurs between cell types that share a common progenitor cell. The mechanisms underlying such cell fate switches are only beginning to be understood. Given the transcription-centric and chromatin-centric nature of cell identity specification, it is clear that deregulation of these facets of gene expression control must play a central role in breaking down the barrier between 2 cell identities. Below I will discuss transcriptional control of cell identity in the pancreas, and the ways in which injury and oncogenic insults disrupt and coopt these processes.\nIn contrast to tissues such as the skin and intestine, the adult pancreas undergoes relatively little cellular turnover. Instead of a dedicated pool of stem cells, the healthy pancreas relies largely on self-duplication to replace aging cells and maintain pancreatic mass.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u> This model for tissue homeostasis is distinct from the hierarchical organization of many highly proliferative tissues such as the intestine通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> or skin,通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> in which self-renewing multipotent stem cells at the top of the hierarchy produce all of the cell types present in the tissue. In the hierarchical model, terminally differentiated cells are non-dividing, and devoid of regenerative capacity.\nThe existence of a hierarchical arrangement in the pancreas was cast into doubt when lineage tracing demonstrated that new insulin-producing β cells are not produced from a non-β-cell source.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> In this experiment, β cells were genetically labeled at a specific time point, such that labeled β-cell progeny would also be marked, a technique known as lineage tracing.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> If β cells are produced from non-β cells, the proportion of labeled cells should decrease over time, as the unlabeled progeny of stem cells replace the labeled cells. Instead, the authors showed that the percentage of labeled β cells remained constant over time, arguing for β-cell duplication as the primary means of endocrine cell homeostasis.\nIn addition to ruling out a stem cell source of β cells, the results of this experiment suggest that epigenetic barriers exist such that under normal conditions, little interconversion between β cells and other cell types occurs. Given the centrality of LDTFs in specifying cell identity, their regulation is central to epigenetic mechanisms that maintain cell identity. In β cells, the α-cell master TF Arx is repressed through several mechanisms, including Dnmt1-dependent repressive promoter methylation.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> This promoter methylation is a key epigenetic barrier between the 2 states; β-cell directed deletion of Dnmt1 resulted in the ectopic expression of Arx and conversion of β cells into α cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> The β-cell master TF Nkx2.2 contributes to the epigenetic locking in of β-cell fate through binding of the Arx locus and the recruitment of the transcriptional corepressor Grg3, which in turn recruits histone deacetylases (HDACs), resulting in Arx repression.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Because diabetes is caused by β-cell loss, there is considerable interest in the possibility of ameliorating the condition by converting other types of cells into β cells. As suggested by the lineage tracing experiments outlined above, this is something that does not occur under normal homeostasis. Similar to the mechanisms preventing β-to-α conversion, the reverse conversion is reciprocally prevented by the combined actions of Arx and Dnmt1.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Loss of these 2 factors in α cells results in reversion to a β-cell like fate. Recent breakthroughs in β-cell replenishment have employed γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and artemisinins, which function through the GABA receptor to affect α-to-β-cell conversion in the pancreas.通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30]</u> In the case of artemisinins, this effect occurred through nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of Arx.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>\nIn contrast to normal homeostasis, the epigenetic barriers between β-cell identity and other cell fates can be lowered in response to insult. By targeting the diphtheria toxin receptor to the β-cell compartment in mice, Thorel et al通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> were able to rapidly ablate 99% of β cells upon diphtheria toxin administration. When provided insulin, the mice survived and showed a marked replenishment of β cells over time. The authors showed by lineage tracing that replenished β cells were derived from the α-cell compartment. In addition to this mechanism of β-cell replacement, it was later shown that somatostatin-producing δ cells can repopulate the β-cell compartment in younger mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Forced conversion of α cells to β cells has been shown to occur upon overexpression of the TFs Mafa, Pax4, or Pdx1,通用删除6(英):<u>[33,34]</u> something that has now been harnessed in pre-clinical gene therapy trials.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>\nWhat is the epigenetic basis for the plasticity that allows non-β endocrine cells to form β cells when they are depleted? Cooccurrence of H3K4me3, a mark associated with active promoters and repressive H3K27me3 renders target genes \"bivalent.\" Bivalent genes are not expressed, but are instead thought to be poised for activation in response to an appropriate signal. This phenomenon was first discovered in embryonic stem cells, where key lineage differentiation genes are silenced, but marked by bivalent histone marks, allowing them to be activated rapidly in response to signaling cues that promote lineage specification.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> Examination of the distribution of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in purified endocrine cell populations has shed light on the plasticity of α cells, which were shown to contain a higher proportion of bivalent genes than β cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> Importantly, many β-cell genes, including key LDTFs Mafa and Pdx1 were bivalently marked in α cells, suggesting that these genes are primed for activation in response to an appropriate signal. Consistent with the proposed role for H3K27me3 in gene repression,通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> the authors went on to show that inhibition of histone methyltransferase(s) responsible for the mark through the general histone methyltransferase inhibitor Adox ectopically activated β-cell genes within the α cells. Shared promoter DNA hypomethylation patterns between α cells and β cells, specifically at key, highly expressed, cell type specific genes such as insulin and glugacon also appears to play a role in plasticity between the 2 cell types.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> In this case, the authors proposed that hypomethylation of β-cell specific genes in α cells licenses their expression in the event of a fate conversion, and is possibly a prerequisite for plasticity. While the precise mechanism of the promoter demethylation was not identified, demethylation was observed to occur upon differentiation of Ngn3-positive endocrine progenitor cells, a precursor of both α cells and β cells. Demethylation is presumably driven by TFs expressed during this developmental window. These results shed light on mechanisms allowing plasticity cell types that share close developmental origins.\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are the second most common form of pancreatic neoplasia and are frequently associated with hormone secretion (insulin, glucagon, gastrin), reflecting a perturbation of normal endocrine cell programs.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> LDTFs that determine normal endocrine cell types were highly expressed in PanNETs in a manner corresponding to the secreted hormone,通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> further illustrating the likelihood that these tumors are an outgrowth of fully or partially differentiated cells of origin, a supposition that has been borne out in mouse models (discussed below). Hormone-secreting PanNETs tend to be less deadly than the more poorly differentiated neoplasms known as neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). NECs are more proliferative, and fail to produce hormones, leading to speculation that these tumors arise from a more primitive endocrine precursor.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> PanNETs and NECs display a distinct mutational profile, indicating that they may indeed be distinct diseases.\nWell differentiated, hormone-secreting PanNETs are frequently associated with the lineage-specific loss of several chromatin regulatory factors, including MEN1, ATRX, and DAXX.通用删除6(英):<u>[42,43]</u> The connection between MEN1 and predisposition to endocrine tumors has long been appreciated, as its mutation is connected with the familial syndrome that provided its name (multiple endocrine neoplasia).通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45]</u> The gene is mutated in a dominant inherited disorder that results in frequent endocrine adenoma formation in the pancreas and other endocrine organs.\nMouse models in which Men1 deletion is targeted to specific endocrine cell compartments have been developed to recapitulate PanNET formation. Interestingly, these models have provided additional examples of plasticity between α and β-cell fates, this time in a neoplastic context. Using a transgenic mouse in which Cre expression was targeted to α cells using the glucagon promoter, glucagonomas, and insulinomas were both frequently observed, with insulinomas coming to predominate over time.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> Interestingly, coexpression of glucagon and insulin was observed in young mice, before tumor formation but concomitant with increased proliferation. The transdifferentiation did not always coincide with expression of a full complement of β-cell LDTFs, indicating that the transition may be to an aberrant β-cell-like entity rather than activation of a normal differentiation program.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> Interestingly, later work indicated that the reverse transition is also possible when Men1 is deleted in β cells, which resulted mostly in insulinomas but also an appreciable rate of glucagonomas.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> It is noteworthy that in human PanNETs, MEN1 alteration is more closely associated with an α-cell gene expression signature.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> It is currently unclear how Men1 loss licenses lineage infidelity in the pancreatic endocrine compartment, and whether transdifferentiation, as opposed to distinct cells of origin, may explain the phenotypic differences in human functional PanNETs.\nMEN1 lacks clearly discernable domains that might provide insights into its function, initially making its precise function within the cell challenging to identify. One route to identification of its function has been through identification of interacting proteins.通用删除6(英):<u>[49,50]</u> MEN1 is a predominantly nuclear protein, and its classification as a chromatin-associated modifier of gene expression was suggested by its interaction with numerous TFs and epigenetic regulators.通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u> Notably, it was found to exist in a complex with trithorax family histone methyltransferases MLL2 and ASH2L, indicating a role in developmentally regulated gene expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> Like many transcriptional regulators, the function of MEN1 in tumorigenesis is highly context-specific; despite its tumor suppressive activities in endocrine cells, MEN1 is essential for MLL-driven leukemia progression through an interaction with MLL,通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u> and also promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> MEN1 has been proposed to function as a molecular scaffold, bridging interactions between signaling molecules and transcriptional regulators to affect transcription.通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u> In contrast to its role in leukemia, in islets, the interaction of MEN1 with MLL, an H3K4 methyltransferase associated with gene activation, promotes recruitment of MLL to and activation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p18 to repress proliferation.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> MEN1 interacts with JUND, repressing JUND-mediated transcriptional activation in a manner disrupted by diseasecausing MEN1 mutations,通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u> likely in part due to blockade of JUN N-terminal kinase-mediated JUND phosphorylation通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> and recruitment of the repressive mSin3a HDAC complex.通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u> In addition, MEN1 interacts with a bevy of transcriptional effectors of various signaling pathways connected to cancer, including Smads, NFκB, and Wnt.通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u> MEN1 interacts with β-catenin, a transcriptional effector of the Wnt pathway, and its loss was shown to promote aberrant β-catenin nuclear accumulation in a mouse model of β-cell-specific Men1 ablation.通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> MEN1-deficient PanNETs are dependent on Wnt/β-catenin signaling,通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u> so this function of MEN1 appears likely to contribute to its context-specific tumor suppression. MEN1 also regulates the hedgehog (Hh) pathway by promoting inhibitory PRMT5-mediated histone arginine methylation at the promoter of GAS1, an Hh coreceptor, dampening the output of the pathway.通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> Inhibition of the Hh component smoothened (SMO) reduced proliferation in a mouse insulinoma model.通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u>\nIn 2012, an exome sequencing study revealed ATRX and DAXX as 2 other frequently altered chromatin-associated proteins in PanNETs.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> Unlike chromatin-associated proteins given the \"epigenetic\" label, ATRX and DAXX play important roles beyond the control of gene expression. ATRX and DAXX form a complex and specifically deposit histone H3.3 at repetitive DNA, notably at telomeres.通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63]</u> While the precise function of H3.3 at telomeres is still an open question,通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> mutational loss of ATRX and DAXX is strongly associated with abnormally long telomeres through a mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> Loss of DAXX and ATRX is associated with a higher degree of chromosomal instability in PanNETs, and reduced patient survival.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> It remains to be seen whether the functions of ATRX and DAXX at telomeres is indeed the primary driver of tumorigenesis spurred on by their absence. It should be noted that the loss of Atrx in a different context, glioma-initiating cells of the mouse brain, leads to widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and leads to alterations in cell identity.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u> In light of these observations, it is likely too early to conclude which functions of these histone chaperones is most relevant to tumor suppression.\nGiven the importance of β-cell depletion to human disease, there has been a strong interest in the possibility that stem or progenitor cells might exist as a source of new β cells, known as neogenesis. The existence of stem or progenitor cells in the pancreas has been a controversial topic, and the reader is referred to several recent reviews for a more in-depth discussion.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,68,69]</u> Ductal cells had been considered an attractive candidate pool of potential progenitor cells for β-cell neogenesis, an idea supported by an early lineage tracing study.通用删除6(英):<u>[70]</u> However, subsequent work has not supported a role for postnatal ductal cells in the formation of endocrine cells under normal circumstances.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>\nWhen the pancreas sustains various forms of injury, an inflammatory condition known as pancreatitis results.通用删除6(英):<u>[71,72]</u> In humans, pancreatitis is associated most strongly with alcoholism and smoking, in addition to a much more rare hereditary pancreatitis predisposition. Pancreatitis appears most likely to result from a blockage of normal pancreatic enzyme secretion that can occur through the obstruction of normal pancreatic ductal flow. This can result in the inappropriate release of activated digestive enzymes in the pancreatic interstitial space, resulting in injury to surrounding cells, causing an inflammatory response.通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u> The major histopathological result of this sequence of events is atrophy of the acinar cell mass, and the appearance of tubular structures reminiscent of ductal cells. The role of inappropriately activated digestive enzymes in the etiology of the disease is underscored by the fact that hereditary pancreatitis can be caused by mutations in PRSS1, the gene encoding cationic trypsinogen.通用删除6(英):<u>[72]</u> The pancreatitis-associated mutations invariably lead to inappropriate autocatalytic activation of the zymogen or stabilization of the active enzyme.\nIn rodents, there are 2 major models that recapitulate aspects of human pancreatitis. In one, partial duct ligation (PDL), the major pancreatic duct that drains the tail of the pancreas into the duodenum is ligated, forming a blockage similar to gallstone pancreatitits.通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u> This results in massive acinar apoptosis and inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[74,75]</u> A second model involves the administration of a choleocystokinin analog known as caerulein, most commonly through intraperitoneal injection. Caerulein is a secretagogue that stimulates the inappropriate release of proteolytic enzymes from acinar cells, thus mimicking the etiology of human disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[76]</u> As with PDL, caerulein administration leads to massive acinar apoptosis, accompanied by the appearance of ductal cells.\nMouse models of pancreatitis have shown conclusively that the exocrine pancreas is capable of a high degree of plasticity upon inflammatory insult.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,77,78]</u> Lineage tracing has demonstrated that ductal structures observed in the inflamed pancreas can result from transdifferentiation of preexisting acinar cells into a duct-like state expressing markers such as Krt19, a process known as acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM).通用删除6(英):<u>[77,79]</u> It is now clear that these cells are of critical importance to both normal pancreatic regeneration and tumorigenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[77,80]</u> While normal ductal cells are incapable of serving as endocrine progenitor cells, there is evidence that the transdifferentiated duct-like cells within ADM lesions are capable of serving as endocrine progenitors.通用删除6(英):<u>[81]</u> Clearly the duct-like state achieved in ADM is a progenitor-like state quite distinct from normal ducts.\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the most common form of pancreas cancer, and it consistently ranks as the tumor type with the worst prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[82,83,84]</u> The most common precursor lesions for PDA are pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), which are graded PanIN-1, PanIN-2, and PanIN-3 depending on their degree of atypia.通用删除6(英):<u>[85]</u> Epidemiological studies have established a link between chronic pancreatitis and increased risk for PDA.通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u> Congruent with this, studies in mice that have demonstrated that metaplastic ductal cells are easily transformed by mutant Kras, and serve as a major cell of origin for PanINs.通用删除6(英):<u>[87,88]</u> These findings are based on the observation that acinar cells, rather than ductal cells serve as a more efficient cell of origin for PanINs.通用删除6(英):<u>[89,90]</u> While these results might have been initially puzzling given the ductal histology of PDA, the requirement for ADM as an early step in acinar-derived pancreatic tumorigenesis seems to explain the apparent discrepancy, and emphasizes the differences in oncogenic potential between normal ductal cells and those comprising ADM lesions .\nThe role of Kras mutations in the process of producing acinarderived PanIN lesions appears to be 2-fold. While mutant Kras expression throughout the pancreas in young mice leads to little histological abnormality, mutant Kras is able to cooperate with caerulein treatment to drive a more complete ADM than that observed in Kras wild-type animals.通用删除6(英):<u>[88,91]</u> In wild-type animals, caerulein-induced ADM resolves within 1-2 weeks of cessation of drug treatment, likely through the redifferentiation of the transient ductal structures into the acinar cells that comprise the bulk of the normal pancreas. In a stark manifestation of its oncogenic abilities, the presence of mutant Kras completely blocks this redifferentiation, preserving the ductal identity of ADM lesions, which eventually give rise to PanINs.通用删除6(英):<u>[88]</u> This process occurs spontaneously at a low rate in mice harboring pancreatic expression of mutant Kras, as the incidence and grade of PanINs increases over time without caerulein administration.通用删除6(英):<u>[92]</u>\nTo fully understand the process by which 2 cell types interconvert, it is first necessary to understand the transcriptional underpinnings of each cell state. Key LDTFs that specify the acinar and ductal states have been identified. Acinar identity is specified in part by pancreas-specific TF 1a (Ptf1a), a basic helixloop-helix (bHLH) TF that is expressed in early pancreatic buds at embryonic day 9,通用删除6(英):<u>[93]</u> becoming restricted to the exocrine pancreas at later embryonic stages, where it is required for specifying the exocrine fate.通用删除6(英):<u>[94]</u> Ptf1a is expressed in multipotent progenitor cells of the pancreas during embryogenesis, while Ptf1a-expressing cells only give rise to acinar cells in postnatal mice (with the exception of injury, as discussed above).通用删除6(英):<u>[81]</u> Ptf1a functions as part of a trimeric complex consisting of another bHLH and either Rbpj (at early stages of pancreatic differentiation), or Rbpjl, as cells commit to an acinar cell fate.通用删除6(英):<u>[95]</u> The Rbpjl-containing complex confers characteristics of terminally differentiated acinar cells, driving expression of digestive enzymes.通用删除6(英):<u>[95]</u> Another acinar bHLH LDTF is Mist1 (Bhlha15), is required for normal differentiation and function of acinar cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[96,97]</u> Mist1 appears to play an important role in organizing secretory programs in a variety of specialized secretory cells in addition to pancreatic acinar cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[98]</u> A third major transcriptional determinant of the acinar state is Nr5a2, which is also required for normal acinar differentiation and function.通用删除6(英):<u>[99,100,101]</u> As is usually the case for LDTFs, extensive cooperation cross-regulation occurs between these 3 acinar state-determining factors, as the 3 factors cooperate to activate shared acinarspecific target genes,通用删除6(英):<u>[99,102,103]</u> and reciprocally activate each other’s expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[102,103]</u> This feedforward mechanism presumably stabilizes and reinforces the acinar cell fate.\nAmple evidence points to acinar LDTFs as a key epigenetic barrier that restrains a latent tendency of acinar cells to undergo ductal transdifferentiation. An early demonstration of this came by disruption of Mist1 function through transgenic expression of a dominant negative form of the protein, which led to activation of ductal genes in acinar cells, reminiscent of ADM.通用删除6(英):<u>[104]</u> In the presence of stimli that promote ADM, the phenotype of Mist1 loss of function is further compounded. In Mist1 knockout mice, expression of mutant Kras is greatly more effective in inducing PanIN formation from acinar cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[105]</u> A similar phenomenon is observed when Ptf1a and Nr5a2 are depleted.通用删除6(英):<u>[100,101,106,107]</u> Based on these results it is clear that acinar cells are primed to adopt a ductal fate upon loss of key acinar factors, or through induction of an appropriate inflammatory signal, while combination of the 2 further exacerbates the phenotype. Recent work has further elucidated the molecular switch between the 2 fates. Pancreata of Nr5a2-/+ mice are highly sensitive to induction of ADM and oncogenic transformation,通用删除6(英):<u>[107]</u> and exist in a constitutive pre-inflammatory state. Examination of gene expression changes that underlie this pre-inflammatory state in Nr5a2-/+ pancreata revealed changes in a number of inflammatory genes and increased activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) family TFs, a transcriptional state that could be phenocopied in wild-type mice by caerulein administration.通用删除6(英):<u>[101]</u> Importantly, Nr5a2 itself is proposed to be intimately involved in the switch between terminal differentiation and inflammation, as it was shown that in Nr5a2-/+ mice the remaining Nr5a2 protein was found not at the usual acinar differentiation genes, but at the very inflammatory genes that higher levels of the protein apparently repress. This redistribution, known as the Nr5a2 \"transcriptional switch\" appears to occur through interactions between Nr5a2 and AP-1 family TFs.通用删除6(英):<u>[101]</u> It remains to be shown whether Nr5a2 actually drives the expression of inflammatory genes during this switch, or is simply present at their genes as a bystander. Arguing for the latter, mice entirely deficient for pancreatic Nr5a2 are highly prone to ADM and inflammation, indicating that the inflammatory gene expression program is not dependent on Nr5a2.通用删除6(英):<u>[100]</u> In any event, it is clear that Nr5a2 and other acinar identity factors actively repress a latent inflammatory and ductal identity program that exists in acinar cells.\nWhile the acinar transcriptional program is silenced during ADM, a duct-like program must simultaneously be activated. Consistent with this, a number of ductal TFs are upregulated concomitant with silencing of the acinar gene expression program, and have been shown to be essential for ADM. Sox9 is an essential component of the embryonic pancreatic progenitor transcriptional program.通用删除6(英):<u>[108]</u> Sox9 expression becomes limited to ducts in adults, and it is required for ductal differentiation.通用删除6(英):<u>[109]</u> Sox9 is upregulated during caerulein-induced ADM, and, while not strictly required for ADM, is essential for KrasG12D-mediated reprogramming of these lesions into PanINs.通用删除6(英):<u>[89]</u> Overexpression of Sox9 in acini results in the ectopic activation of ductal genes, and cooperates with inflammation to potentiate ADM.通用删除6(英):<u>[89]</u> A similar essential role in ADM has been established for a set of additional lineage-restricted TFs, including Klf4,通用删除6(英):<u>[110]</u> Klf5,通用删除6(英):<u>[111]</u> and Etv5.通用删除6(英):<u>[112]</u> Pdx1 is a key determinant of embryonic pancreatic progenitors, and its overexpression can promote ADM.通用删除6(英):<u>[113]</u> Paradoxically, Pdx1 deletion in adult acinar cells promotes increased ADM, indicating that Pdx1 also plays a role in maintaining acinar identity.通用删除6(英):<u>[114]</u> However, Pdx1 upregulation is regularly seen in PDA and its associated pre-neoplastic lesions, indicating it may play a distinct role upon establishment of ductal identity. Indeed, Pdx1 was shown to be required for proliferation of several mouse and human pancreatic cancer cell lines.通用删除6(英):<u>[114]</u> Such functional switches for important LDTFs within different cells in the same tissue have been shown in other tissues.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> In addition to lineage-type factors, stress-responsive and signal-responsive TFs also play a role in the transition to a ductal phenotype. Pancreatic injury that results in pancreatitis is coupled to activation of the unfolded protein response,通用删除6(英):<u>[115]</u> which in turn activates Atf3, which plays a role in repressing the acinar cell transcriptional program during ADM.通用删除6(英):<u>[116]</u> Il6-gp130 signaling plays an important role in the development of pancreatic cancer,通用删除6(英):<u>[117]</u> and a key transcriptional mediator of this pathway is Stat3, which is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to Il6 signaling. Stat3 knockout attenuated ADM and PanIN formation, and was required for progression to PDA.通用删除6(英):<u>[118]</u> Stat3 physically associates with another SDTF that is activated during inflammation, Nfatc1 to promote KrasG12D-promoted tumorigenesis to activate transcription of the Sox9 gene, providing an important link between the induction of inflammation and the activation of ductal identity. Finally, as mentioned above, activation of AP-1 family TFs during inflammation is required to drive ADM.通用删除6(英):<u>[101]</u>\nAlthough many of the transcriptional players involved in the ADM-PanIN progression have been identified (the cast), we are still lacking a global picture of how they interact to drive the process (the play). Many outstanding questions remain. For example, the assumption of ductal identity by acinar cells apparently gives rise to cells primed for mutant Kras-driven neoplastic transformation, and many components of the ductal transcriptional network are required for this. What distinguishes the transformable duct-like cells in ADM from normal duct cells that are resistant to Kras-driven transformation? How does mutant Kras signaling interact with transcriptional network in the transformable ADM lesions to \"lock in\" the ductal phenotype? While normal ducts are resistant to Kras-driven transformation, normal ducts can give rise to PDA when Kras activation is coupled to p53 loss or mutation,通用删除6(英):<u>[119,120]</u> or, as will be discussed below, upon loss of chromatin remodeling factors. Interestingly, in this setting, a direct progression to PDA apparently occurs without a PanIN intermediate.通用删除6(英):<u>[120]</u> How p53 governs the transformability of normal ductal cells is currently unknown.\nCancer is, for good reason, considered a disease of the genome, as its initiation and progression is almost invariably caused by mutational activation of oncogenes and genetic loss of tumor suppressors. However, in recent years, limits to the role of genetics in determining tumor phenotype have become clear. Most notably, despite numerous attempts to identify them, no recurrent metastasis-driving genetic aberrations have been found in human samples.通用删除6(英):<u>[121]</u> This has required a search for epigenetic explanations for the acquisition of metastatic traits. Recent work has explored this using mouse organoids derived from the Pdx1-Cre; lox-stop-lox KrasG12D; lox-stop-lox p53R172H (KPC) model. Organoids derived from non-metastatic primary tumors show little ability to colonize the lung or liver, and grow relatively slowly when orthotopically transplanted. In contrast, organoids derived from lung, liver, or peritoneal metastases perform efficiently in metastatic colonization assays and grow rapidly at the primary site, indicating a general, catastrophic gain in aggressiveness in the metastatic tumors.通用删除6(英):<u>[122]</u> To probe epigenomic differences between the more indolent primary tumors and metastases, Vakoc et al subjected the 2 sets of organoids to enhancer profiling using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for H3K27ac and H3K4me1, the combined presence of which mark enhancers. This resulted in strikingly reproducible patterns of hundreds of gained and lost enhancers in metastatic organoids compared to primary tumor organoids.通用删除6(英):<u>[123]</u> The gained enhancers were associated with an embryonic endodermal progenitor transcriptional signature, suggesting a dedifferentiation event as a driver of gained aggressiveness. The authors focused on the transcriptional determinants of gained enhancers, and searched for TF binding motifs enriched in these sites. Using this approach, they identified a forkhead box family motif and GATA-type motif. Members of both families were upregulated in metastatic organoids, namely, Foxa1 and Gata5. Overexpression of these factors in indolent primary tumor organoids was sufficient to recapitulate the progenitor-like enhancer and gene expression signature, and greatly boosted their metastatic properties.通用删除6(英):<u>[123]</u> Foxa1 and Gata5 likely represent only part of the story, as other motifs, most notably the AP-1 family motif, were even more enriched in the gained regions. Gains in mutant Kras signaling output have been shown to drive metastasis in PDA mouse models,通用删除6(英):<u>[124]</u> indicating that increased signaling through a Kras-AP-1 axis might also contribute to the gained metastatic abilities of the cells.\nSimilar approaches have been taken to explore the transcriptional basis of intertumoral heterogeneity in human cells. Comparison of enhancer landscapes in cells derived from low-grade and high-grade PDA revealed a set of grade-specific enhancers.通用删除6(英):<u>[125]</u> Interestingly, a KLF5-dependent program dominated low-grade specific enhancers, and this was lost in highgrade enhancers. Low-grade cells were dependent on KLF5 for maximal proliferation, while expression of KLF5 was lost in higher grade tumors.通用删除6(英):<u>[125]</u> As discussed above, Klf5 is required for PDA initiation of tumorigenesis in the mouse model.通用删除6(英):<u>[111]</u> It is also a determinant of the epithelial state that is downregulated during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), resulting in apoptosis in bulk epithelial tumor cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[126]</u> These results suggest that, while early events in pancreatic tumorigenesis are dependent on KLF5, cells in advanced tumors are able to find viable transcriptional configurations that are independent of KLF5, allowing them to be freed of the constraints on invasiveness imposed by the KLF5-dependent epithelial phenotype. This theme has emerged in other epithelial tumor types in which LDTFs that play a role in proliferation in the normal progenitors are required for early lesions and well differentiated tumors, while their loss is more advanced tumors is associated with increased invasiveness. Examples of this are GATA3 in breast cancer通用删除6(英):<u>[127]</u> and NKX2-1 in lung.通用删除6(英):<u>[128]</u> It should be noted that the organoid-based study of Vakoc et al通用删除6(英):<u>[123]</u> found no evidence of a contribution of EMT to increased aggressiveness in KPC tumors.\nTranscriptional determinants that distinguish pancreatic cancer subtypes from each other have only very recently begun to be explored. The squamous subtype of pancreatic cancer represents approximately 25% of PDA, and has a particularly dismal prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[129]</u> The squamous subtype is associated with mutations in the H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6A,通用删除6(英):<u>[129]</u> and inactivation of Kdm6a combines with mutant Kras to drive squamous-type carcinomas in the murine pancreas.通用删除6(英):<u>[130]</u> Examination of the enhancer landscape in squamous compared with non-squamous PDA cells revealed a set of over 1000 squamousspecific enhancers, a program controlled by the squamous LDTF ΔNp63.通用删除6(英):<u>[131]</u> ΔNp63 conferred squamous characteristics on nonsquamous tumors, and became a tumor dependency in squamous tumor cells. These results show that adenocarcinoma cells are capable of squamous transdifferentiation, indicating that squamous subtype tumors may emerge from the same cell of origin and precursor lesions as other PDA subtypes, which appears likely because the normal pancreas contains no squamous epithelia. The exact molecular events that surround the emergence of ΔNp63 expression in the squamous subtype are still unclear.\nA wide variety of cancers display frequent genetic alterations in chromatin remodeling factors, most notably members of the SWI/SNF complex.通用删除6(英):<u>[132,133,134]</u> In pancreatic cancer, ARID1A is the most frequently mutated SWI/SNF subunit.通用删除6(英):<u>[135,136]</u> Recent work in mouse models has begun to elucidate the role of key SWI/SNF subunits in pancreatic tumorigenesis. In the first direct demonstration of the tumor suppressive role of SWI/SNF in PDA, pancreas-specific knockout of the ATPase subunit Brg1 (Smarca4) was shown to promote the formation of ductal cell-derived intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) a cystic neoplasm that can, like PanINs, serve as a precursor lesion for PDA.通用删除6(英):<u>[137]</u> Like human IPMN-associated PDA, the PDA formed in Brg1 conditional knockout mice was more indolent than PanIN-associated PDA driven by p53 knockout. The relationship between Brg1 loss and tumorigenesis is context-specific, because while it restrains neoplastic transformation of ductal cells, its loss in acinar cells reduced PanIN formation.通用删除6(英):<u>[137]</u> When Brg1 was restored in Brg1-null PDA cells, its tumor-suppressive properties were no longer apparent, and instead the cells displayed a more aggressive EMT-like phenotype.通用删除6(英):<u>[138]</u> Loss of Arid1a partially phenocopies loss of Brg1, as Arid1a loss in ducts results in an IPMN-PDA sequence that mirrors the effect of Brg1 deletion.通用删除6(英):<u>[139,140]</u> Distinct from Brg1, loss of Arid1a in acinar cells resulted in increased ADM and PanIN formation.通用删除6(英):<u>[139,141,142]</u> SWI/SNF complexes are large, multiprotein assemblies, that display developmental stage-specific and tissue-specific subunit composition.通用删除6(英):<u>[143]</u> Many SWI/SNF subunits enter the complex in a mutually exclusive manner (e.g. Arid1a or Arid1b). It is possible that the apparently disparate roles of Brg1 and Arid1a in acinar-derived PanIN formation is the result of tumor suppressive functions for Arid1a-containing complexes, while complexes lacking Arid1a but containing Brg1 play essential role in the ADM-PanIN sequence. Much work is necessary to explore the potential distinct roles of various SWI/SNF complexes during tumor formation. Interestingly, using a tetracycline-dependent short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to deplete Arid1a in vivo, the ADM phenotype was shown to be highly dependent on the timing of Arid1a inactivation with respect to Kras mutation. When Arid1a was depleted simultaneous with Kras mutation (on embryonic day 7), little ADM and PanIN formation was observed. In contrast, when Arid1a was depleted postnatally PanINs formed efficiently.通用删除6(英):<u>[142]</u> In contrast to irreversible loxp-mediated gene inactivation, inducible shRNAs also allow for the restoration of tumor suppressors upon tumor formation.通用删除6(英):<u>[144]</u> Using this approach, it was shown that, in contrast to tumor suppressors for which restoration results in regression of established tumors (such as p53通用删除6(英):<u>[145]</u> and adenomatous polyposis coli [APC]通用删除6(英):<u>[146]</u>), Arid1a restoration had no effect in PanINs promoted by its loss.通用删除6(英):<u>[142]</u> This would be consistent with Arid1a restraining a transition to a transcriptional state that, once achieved, cannot be reversed.\nRelatively few insights into the mechanisms by which loss of SWI/SNF components drives the formation of IPMN from ducts have been obtained. IPMN formation is thought to involve a still poorly defined \"dedifferentiation\" of ductal identity. In this process, ductal markers are downregulated while \"progenitor\" markers are upregulated, a process that occurs in ductal cells upon knockout of either Brg1通用删除6(英):<u>[138]</u> or Arid1a.通用删除6(英):<u>[140]</u> At least in the case of Arid1a, it has been suggested that this occurs through downregulation of Sox9,通用删除6(英):<u>[140]</u> although we are far from a mechanistic understanding of the tumor suppressive role of chromatin remodelers in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Attempts to directly look at the impact of Arid1a depletion on transcriptional programs in the pancreas using Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) in sorted epithelial cells have been hampered by the high degree of epithelial heterogeneity in the inflamed pancreas.通用删除6(英):<u>[142]</u> Because of this, ATAC-seq results might simply reflect the degree of ADM in the 2 conditions, but shed no light on the relevant changes in the incipient transformed cell. An understanding of the effect of Arid1a depletion would require direct examination of purified tumor-initiating cells, something that is currently technically difficult.\nConsiderable progress has been made in elucidating the transcriptional underpinnings of cellular plasticity and tumorigenesis in the pancreas. Key factors contribute to both processes, providing clear molecular links between processes whose functional connections have long been clear. Dynamic changes in the LDTFs that determine cell identity are central to these processes in both the exocrine and endocrine pancreas. While many TFs that drive key pathophysiological processes from ADM to tumor formation and progression have been identified, systematic approaches will be necessary to a complete picture of the transcriptional networks that drive these processes, and especially the interplay between SDTFs and LDTFs. This will demonstrate how oncogenic signals tap into transcriptional programs that exist in the inflamed pancreas. Because all transcriptional programs are strongly dependent on and influenced by chromatin regulators, the impact of key factors, such as Arid1a, will need to be understood through their impact on essential transcriptional programs at a global and biochemical level. New techniques allowing the interrogation of small numbers of cells derived from in vivo sources, such as ATAC-seq should soon allow for this.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

In adipose tissue with severe contusion or fatty liver with crush injury, the lipid droplets are freely educed from the ruptured fat cells and enter the blood stream through the broken small vein and cause fat embolism. The severity of fat embolism depends on the size and quantity of lipid droplets, and the level of systemic involvement. Fat embolism mainly affects the lungs and nervous system. In 1970 Gurd1 proposed the clinical diagnostic criteria for fat embolism: 1) The main criteria: subcutaneous hemorrhage; respiratory symptoms and lung X-ray manifestations; neurologic symptoms without craniocerebral trauma; 2) The secondary criteria: arterial partial pressure of oxygen lower than 8.0 kpa (60 mmHg); decreased hemoglobin (<100 g/L); 3) Reference criteria: fever; pulse greater than 120 beats/minute; breathing greater than 30 beats/minute; erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 70 mm/h; the decreased platelets; lipid droplets in the urine. The diagnosis of fat embolism can be confirmed by two main criteria above, or one main criterion plus four secondary and reference criteria. Sevitt divided the fat embolism into three types: eruption type, complete and incomplete types, in which the incomplete type includes pure cerebral type, pure pulmonary type and mixed type. Diagnosis of pulmonary and mixed types is easier, based on the pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, hemoptysis and lung wet rales, patchy shadows in the lung scan, hypoxemia, etc. But the cerebral fat embolism mainly manifests as disturbance of cerebral circulation, cerebral ischemia and consciousness and loss of nerve function; there are no manifestations of chest distress, dyspnea or other pulmonary manifestations, therefore it is easily misdiagnosed.\nIn this study, two cases of cerebral fat embolism were analyzed and the related literature was reviewed, to explore the pathogenesis and the effective treatment.\nA 25-year-old male was admitted to the department of ophthalmology of our hospital in August 25, 2012, who complained about left eye pain, vision loss, and right lower limb movement disorder for 13 h after a traffic accident. Physical examination showed normal mental status, irregular left pupil with disappeared light reflex, right pupil of 2.5 mm in diameter with fast pupillary light reflex. The examination of heart, lungs and abdomen showed no abnormalities. Right lower limb was fixed by external fixation with restrained movement. The results were negative in neurological examination. The X-ray performed in a local hospital the day before showed right tibial and fibular fractures. The brain CT in both our hospital and the local hospital showed no abnormalities. Left corneal debridement was performed at 10:00 am on August 26. All the operations were successful, and then the patient returned to the ward. At 13:50 pm of the same day, the patient presented dysphoria and unconsciousness. CT scans of head, neck and chest all were negative. The next day unconsciousness aggravated and patient was transferred to our department. Head MRI showed long T1 and T2 signals with diffuse punctuates, and high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) throughout bilateral cerebral cortex, white matter, basal ganglion, thalamus and brainstem .\nA 25-year-old male suffered coma with intermittent convulsive movements of limb for 9 days after trauma and was admitted to our hospital on May 25, 2014. The patient was conscious at first after trauma and the CT performed in local hospital found no obvious signs of cerebral hemorrhage. However during the treatment, consciousness disturbance appeared and even developed deep coma, with frequent convulsion. Physical examination revealed deep coma, bilateral isocoria with about 3 mm in diameter, and fast pupillary light reflex. There was coarse sound in bilateral lungs and no distinct dry or wet rale. Both lower limbs were fixed by plaster cast. There was swelling and deformity in the right thigh. The X-rays from the local hospital showed right femoral comminuted fracture and bilateral tibial comminuted fracture; head MRI showed diffuse abnormal signals in bilateral cerebral hemisphere, callus, cerebellum and brainstem, which may reveal the hematogenous embolization . After admission, symptomatic and supportive treatments were given to lower the intracranial pressure, protect brain, and prevent convulsion. Finally convulsion was stopped and consciousness recovered.\nBesides their ages, the two patients have several things in common: both suffered trauma, combined with lower extremity long bone fractures; both were conscious within 24 h after injury, then consciousness disturbance appeared and it developed into deep coma 24 h post injury; multiple head CT results were negative. In the hospital, both patients' respiration was stable without obvious dyspnea, chest distress or other pulmonary manifestations. Multiple blood gas analysis was normal. Considering that patients suffered trauma, obnubilation appeared and no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage was seen in multiple CT, diffuse axonal injury was suggested. The main characteristics of diffuse axonal injury are: after traumatic shearing forces that occur when the head is rapidly accelerated or decelerated, patients became coma or restless immediately after injury and the state will last a long time and recover slowly. A small number of the patients may have lucid intervals, and no clear signs of focal lesion in the nervous system. These lesions often cannot be found in head CT. While in head MRI they mainly manifest as diffuse edema of bilateral cerebral white matter, brain swelling, ambiguous boundary of gray matter, the narrowed or disappeared ventricle, cerebral pool, cerebral sulcus and subarachnoid space, absence of midline shift, diffuse brain swelling associated with diffuse punctuates throughout white matter and splinter hemorrhage; but no hematoma or spaceoccupying effect was found and thin layer of subdural hemorrhage may be accompanied with.\nOur patients have a noticeable history of trauma, but without obvious shear stress, and they were conscious after injury, then progressed into coma during the treatment, 24 h after trauma. CT was negative before and after coma and the main clinical manifestations were confusion and unstable breathing. The results of head MRI were similar: long T1 and T2 signals with diffuse punctuates, and high signal intensity on DWI throughout bilateral cerebral cortex, white matter, basal ganglion, thalamus and brainstem. Because these clinical manifestations do not fully comply with the diffuse axonal injury, we considered that maybe some other diseases existed. Considering the patients' age and the history of trauma, hypertension-induced infarction, other chronic diseases, and intracranial infection (especially disseminated encephalitis) pose a small possibility. Due to a history of long bone fracture caused by trauma, a cerebral fat embolism should be suspected. Fat embolism often occurs in the lungs. A pure cerebral fat embolism is rare, and its pathogenesis is not fully understood.\nMost literatures reveal that a fat embolism mostly occurs after a long bone fracture, especially after a femoral fracture. Gleich et al2 reported that a 42-year-old healthy male patient suffered fractures of calcaneus, navicular, talus and metatarsal bone caused by an accidental gunshot wound while hunting. Six hours after injury, consciousness disturbance gradually appeared. No evidence of long bone fractures, pulmonary or cutaneous manifestations were present. Head MRI found numerous tiny infarcts in the brain hemispheres, cerebellum and brainstem, consistent with the manifestations of cerebral fat embolism. Two months after treatment, patient's consciousness recovered completely without any sequelae. The case shows that a fat embolism can be caused not only by a long bone fracture, but also by other types of bone fractures, and the prognosis of pure cerebral fat embolism is better.\nCerebral fat embolism is rare in clinics. In recent years there are some reports of cases, but its real pathogenesis is still not very clear. Normally embolus in the venous system of a lower extremity can migrate to the intracranial vessels only through pulmonary circulation. At first the shedding emboli cause a lung fat embolism and then induce ischemia and hypoxia of pulmonary circulation which results in a series of clinical disorders, such as difficult breathing and chest distress. In severe cases, it is life-threatening. Jacobsen et al3 reported that cerebral changes are seen in 86% of patients with fat embolism syndrome (FES).\nSo far, two theories have been postulated for FES: The first is the mechanical theory. Following trauma, intramedullary fat is released into the venous system,4 and fat emboli travels through the pulmonary circulation into the aorta and eventually leads to FES. The most involved sites are the lung and brain among which the brain accounts for about 1/3. Once the lipomicron reaches the pulmonary vasculature, which will cause lung disfunction, or travels through the cardiac or the pulmonary shunting into the systemic circulation, it blocks the cerebral vessels and then induces changes in the nervous system.5 In normal people, approximately 35% have open foramen ovale. Some foreign scholars have injected radiolabeled triacylglycerol into the internal carotid arteries of rats and found that more than 44% remained in the brain, and only 7% in the lung tissue. The vast majority of radiolabeled triacylglycerol was distributed in the ipsilateral hemisphere, while a few were distributed in the contralateral hemisphere, brainstem and cerebellum. Emboli can remain in the brain for several days, causing damage to brain tissue and the blood-brain barrier. However in our cases, there was no evidence of pulmonary shunting or closure of the foramen ovale; so it indicated that there may be other reasons leading to the cerebral fat embolism. The other is the biochemical theory. When the body is in a stressed state, increased catecholamine secretion mobilizes a large amount of the periphery fat into the blood, then the activated lipase cleaves triglycerides into glycerol and free fatty acids; the release of free fatty acid induces a microvascular inflammatory response, homeostatic imbalance of fat in the body and formation of lipid droplets which gather in the capillary to produce fat emboli, leading to organ dysfunction.6 Interestingly, there is no evidence of any other organ dysfunction except brain, which indicates to us that inflammation may be limited to the brain, but its mechanism has not been elucidated.\nIn general, most fat emboli passes to the lungs through blood circulation, then mechanical occlusion leads to pulmonary dysfunction which further develops to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and may even cause death. Cerebral fat embolism does not induces pulmonary symptoms, perhaps because a few fat droplets in a small diameter (<7-20 um) can pass through the pulmonary capillaries or the open foramen ovale into systemic circulation and lodge in the cerebral vessels.7 Fat embolism in the brain causes hypoxia and abnormal metabolites which affect diffuse thalamic projection system and the sensory association areas of temporal lobe, and may result in hallucination in patients who have a fracture, complicated with cerebral FES. When the excitatory neurotransmitter depletes, patients become drowsy and unconscious. This may explain why patients with cerebral fat embolism are unconscious 24 h after injury.\nThe typical symptoms of fat embolism include hypopnoea, cerebral dysfunction and skin petechiae. Patients with pure cerebral fat embolism have no respiratory system manifestations, history of craniocerebral trauma, coma or shock. Apathy, lethargy, convulsion, coma and limb muscle tension begin to appear in the early period (12 h-3 d). Blood pressure is normal, often accompanied with fever, rapid breathing and heart rate, and scattered bleeding points in the chest as well as the neck. Some patients have central facial palsy or hemiplegia, and few have hallucinations, etc, which mainly manifest as excitement, auditory hallucination, sexual hallucinations or aggressive behavior, and are often mistaken for schizophrenia or a reactive disorder. In 1970, Gurd proposed the clinical diagnostic criteria for fat embolism. However diagnostic criteria specifically for cerebral fat embolism are not clear, and are mainly dependent on medical history, clinical manifestations and related examinations. Undoubtedly, head MRI has become an indispensable diagnosis tool for cerebral fat embolism.8 By contrast, the value of CT scan in the diagnosis of cerebral fat embolism is not high, but it can be used for excluding a mental disorder which may be caused by other reasons.删除4：<u>9</u>\nThere are no specific treatment guidelines for cerebral fat embolism. Most scholars think that symptomatic and supportive therapy is the main treatment. Early fixed fractured stump can significantly reduce the incidence of fat embolism.10 The above patients had been given the metal external fixation or cast immobilization before admission. The effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy remains controversial and some scholars believe that hormones can maintain the stability of the cell microsomal membranes, prevent the inflammatory response caused by fatty acids, reduce capillary permeability and lighten tissue edema. Some animal experiments have proven that after administration of dexamethasone, plasma free fatty acids decreased, and the number of lipid droplets in venous thrombosis was significantly reduced, which may be due to fat emulsification by dexamethasone. Hormone pulse therapy is commonly recommended: such as dexamethasone 20-30 mg/d or 60 mg/d, or methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg/d for 3-5 d, until the brain edema subsides. Other treatments include respiratory support and lipid soluble drugs. Fat emboli can be dissolved by soluble saponin which has been synthesized by 5% sodium bicarbonate and fat; albumin toxicity can be reduced after it is combined with free fatty acids; 5% alcohol glucose solution can inhibit formation of fat droplets; low-dose heparin can reduce blood viscosity, prevent the release of stress reaction-induced substances, improve local microcirculation, and can also make the plasma fat emulsification and eventually remove the lipid in the blood. In addition, 20% sodium dehydrocholate, aprotinin, or low molecular dextran can also be used in clinical treatment. A dehydrating agent and the head cooling therapy should be adopted to protect brain function. To alleviate brain edema, lower metabolism in the brain cells, improve brain tissue oxygen and protect brain cell function, cerebral tonic and sedative drug can be used. Effectiveness of early hyperbaric oxygen therapy on cerebral fat embolism has been confirmed. It increases blood oxygen pressure and oxygen content as well as radial diffusion of oxygen in capillary of the brain tissue to improve microcirculation. It also stimulates capillary growth in the focal zone to promote establishment of collateral circulation, restores the function of brain cells in penumbral area, increases phagocytosis of phagocytic cells, improves the function of the reticular activating system in the brainstem and enhances the rehabilitative potential of coma patients.\nIn addition to the original mechanical and biochemical theories, condensation theory11 and inflammatory response theory12 have also proposed in recent years. In general, there will be a great development in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of cerebral fat embolism, and more new problems in further researches will be put forward.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2015.03.001</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The Egger (P= 0.681) and Begg (P= 0.902) tests also suggested no significant publication bias among included studies.\nDHIF is a serious elbow joint trauma and widely occurs in young adults. This complex fracture is intraarticular and involves the surface of the joint. Therefore, surgical intervention is a standard strategy for management of DHIF because the prognosis for conservative treatment was poor. The use of triceps-sparing approach could fully reveal the humerus distal articular surface, obtain the shattering of the distal humerus fractures and block displacement by space between triceps brachialis and brachioradialis, or the biceps and the triceps internally and externally of the distal humerus, which could avoid the damage for the stretch elbow. However, triceps-sparing approach lacks sufficient reveal for the distal humerus. The use of olecranon osteotomy can overcome the above shortcoming, and get more attention in clinical practice. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of olecranon osteotomy vs. triceps-sparing approach before the open reduction and internal fixation for patients with DHIF. A total of 637 patients were recruited from nine studies and the pooled results suggested no significant differences between groups for excellent/good elbow function, Mayo elbow performance score, duration of operation, blood loss, and complications. However, sensitivity analyses found olecra-non osteotomy might be associated with better excellent/good elbow function, while the duration of operation, blood loss, and complications in olecranon osteotomy group might be inferior than triceps-sparing approach.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Chen et al compared various surgical approaches on elbow functional outcomes for patients with DHIF.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> They concluded olecranon osteotomy was superior than triceps-sparing approach in restoring joint function (OR: 2.38; P= 0.009). However, this analysis just contained four studies, and other efficacy and safety outcomes were not evaluated. Moreover, stratified analyses according to study or patients’ characteristics were not illustrated. Therefore, the current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effectiveness of olecranon osteotomy vs. triceps-sparing approach for patients with DHIF.\nThe pooled result of this study found olecranon osteotomy did not yield beneficial effect than triceps-sparing approach on the incidence of excellent/good elbow function. However, this non-significant difference might be bias from the study conducted by Liu et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> which specifically reported olecranon osteotomy was inferior than triceps-sparing approach for patients with DHIF. Olecranon osteotomy approach through turning the olecranon and triceps proximally and dislocating the elbow joint, then fully exposing the distal condyle of the humerus, played an auxiliary role in the reduction and fixation of fractures. The shortcoming of olecranon osteotomy was to cause artificial fracture of the olecranon in order to make the fracture site fully exposed, resulting in additional lateral injury. Moreover, internal fixation of the olecranon fracture was required after the DHIF, which was associated with longer operation time and the impaired elbow function or muscle strength.\nSimilarly, the summary results suggested no significant differences between groups for Mayo elbow performance score, duration of operation, blood loss, and complications. However, sensitivity analyses found olecranon osteotomy might be associated with longer operation time, higher blood loss, and excess risk of complications. These results were mainly biased by the study conducted by Wang et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> specifically with low quality. They pointed out the treatment of DHIF by triceps-sparing approach did not yield excess damage of elbow flexion and extension function. Moreover, the injury was tiny and the local blood supply was better, then the ulnar and radial nerves could be repaired. Therefore, the elbow joint could be restored at the early stage with less post-operative complications.\nThe limitations of this study included: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> both RCTs and observational studies were included, and the pooled results could be biased by uncontrolled confounded factors; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> substantial heterogeneity among included studies for several results, which could not be fully explained by sensitivity and sub-group analyses; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the effect estimated in observational study was based on crude data, and the factors that could affect the prognosis of DHIF were not adjusted; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the severity of DHIF could affect the prognosis, while stratified analyses were not conducted because of the restricted information regarding the baseline characteristics of patients; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> similar to other traditional meta-analyses, individual patients data and publication bias could restrict the recommendation of this study.\nThis study did not find any benefit for olecranon osteotomy vs. triceps-sparing approach, while sensitivity analysis suggested the incidence of excellent/good elbow function might increase for patients treated with olecranon osteotomy. Moreover, potential harmful effects of olecra-non osteotomy on operation time, blood loss, and complications were observed.

A subgroup of patients with pulmonary hemorrhage were identified which may offer new pathophysiological insights. Pulmonary hemorrhage is a heterogeneous disease group ranging from anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies positive vasculitis and lupus associated disease to primary pulmonary hemosiderosis. A cellular understanding of pulmonary hemosiderosis is lacking.删除4：<u>2</u>\nSFTPC-associated surfactant deficiency is an autosomal dominant monogenic cause of interstitial lung disease, causing a range of pulmonary symptoms.3,4 The most commonly identified mutation in SFTPC is a missense change, annotated I73T in the literature and accounting for about 30% of all cases. It is associated with a range of clinical presentations. Tang et al1 highlight the findings of pulmonary hemorrhage and auto-antibodies, and even a family history of rheumatoid arthritis in one patient’s father, who also carried the mutation. This finding supports that SFTPC mutations have variable phenotypic expressivity, which can include pulmonary hemorrhage. Additionally, the authors report that these two patients responded well to treatment with hydroxychloroquine.\nThese features of pulmonary hemorrhage and auto-immunity have recently been described in another condition, COPA syndrome.2,5 COPA syndrome, which is named for the gene that is mutated (coatomer protein complex alpha: COPα), is typically associated with arthritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. The COPA gene regulates intracellular transport, playing a key role in protein synthesis and packaging. The COPA I complex, which includes the COPα protein, mediates retrograde transport from the Golgi back to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As such, it regulates the transport of misfolded proteins back to the ER for reprocessing or into lysosomes for destruction. In COPA syndrome, there is a defect in protein transport, which results in significant ER stress. ER stress in the alveolar epithelium or immune cells is likely to be central to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hemorrhage. In COPA syndrome, there is an immune defect, which causes increased numbers of Th17 cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, including IL-1β and IL-6. This immune defect could be causative for pulmonary hemorrhage but is unlikely to be the whole story as lung biopsies from these patients lack significant inflammatory signatures. ER stress in epithelial cells such as type II pneumocytes is hypothesized to be central to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hemorrhage.\nMutations in SFTPC are known to cause interstitial lung disease with a wide spectrum of pathology.4 Pulmonary hemorrhage is now a recognized feature. This description by Tang et al offers further supporting evidence that ER stress in alveolar epithelium is central to pulmonary hemorrhage. SFTPC encodes a large 21-kD precursor protein, which is proteolytically processed to the 3.7-kD mature hydrophobic form. It is packaged in the lamellar body and subsequently secreted into the airspace with surfactant protein B and phospholipids. The larger precursor protein has a key domain, the BRICHOS domain that is necessary for the transport/chaperoning of the hydrophobic protein across the trans-Golgi network. More than 60 mutations in SFTPC have been identified in patients with interstitial lung disease. The majority of reported mutations are located in the BRICHOS domain. Several studies of BRICHOS mutations demonstrated an accumulation of misfolded proSP-C in the rER and Golgi, which triggers ER stress and apoptosis. The common I73T mutation is in the linker region between the BRICHOS domain and the mature protein. This mutation interferes with autophagic vesicle formation resulting in the accumulation of large intracytoplasmic vacuoles in the cell. Mechanistically, the I73T mutation results in significant ER stress. The response to hydroxychloroquine, a potent inhibitor of autophagy, is intriguing.\nAs SP-C’s expression is confined to type II pneumocytes, these cells are central to the pathology of pulmonary hemorrhage. Indeed, the health of these cells is central to the integratory of pulmonary epithelium. SFTPC mutations that lead to ER stress can cause pulmonary interstitial lung disease and have now been associated with pulmonary hemorrhage. This case series adds to our understanding of the role of ER stress in type II pneumocytes in lung disease.\nNone.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

It is important to be aware of coronary anomalies because they may be associated with potentially serious cardiac events. Therefore, we report a rare case of an anomalous origin of the RCA from the mid left anterior descending artery (mLAD), which presented with acute myocardial infarction just proximal to the origin of the RCA, jeopardizing both the LAD and RCA.\nA 42-year-old man who was deaf and mute was referred to the emergency room for the evaluation of progressive substernal chest pain that had lasted for three days. Initial electrocardiography indicated sinus tachycardia and deep T wave inversion at the anterior precordial lead and pathological Q waves in the inferior limb leads, suggesting that he might have had a recent myocardial infarction at the left ventricle inferior wall and anterior wall ischemia. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly without pulmonary congestion, and his blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg with a heart rate of 108 beats/min. Coronary angiography was performed within an hour. During the coronary angiogram, several attempts at engaging the RCA failed. We considered several possible anomalous origins of the RCA and tried to engage it at various positions but were unsuccessful. We shifted to the left coronary system. The left coronary angiogram showed that the anomalous RCA, as a separate branch, emanated from the mLAD, proceeded anterior to the pulmonary trunk, and finally advanced to the right atrioventricular groove. Between the first septal perforator and the branching of the anomalous RCA, there was a tandem tight stenotic lesion in the mLAD. The thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade to the main LAD was III, but the TIMI flow grade to the anomalous RCA was slightly decreased, with a flow between II and III. We performed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a 6 Fr XB® guiding catheter (Cordis, USA) and a Rungthrough® guidewire (Terumo, Japan) using a right radial artery approach. After ballooning with a 2.5 mm × 20.0 mm Maverick® balloon (Boston Scientific, USA), intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided stenting was performed at the mLAD, not crossing, but just above the origin of the anomalous RCA, with a 4.5 mm × 16.0 mm Liberte® stent (Boston Scientific). We included additional wiring at the RCA because the TIMI flow grade at the anomalous RCA was diminished from TIMI II–III to I–II after stenting at the LAD most likely due to the distal embolization of microthrombi in the RCA territory or the extrusion of the stent strut to the origin of the anomalous RCA. In addition, we opened the origin of the anomalous RCA by adjusting the stent strut and bifurcation carina with a small balloon (2.5 mm × 20.0 mm) and minimal pressure. Finally, sequential ballooning was performed at the mLAD with a noncompliant balloon. After confirming that there were no protruding stent struts, via IVUS and no complications, RCA flow was recovered after an intracoronary injection of 2 mg of nicorandil 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a, Figure 1b, Figure 1c]</u>. Several days after PCI, computed tomographic coronary angiography revealed the RCA arising from the mLAD and running anteriorly to the pulmonary artery and right ventricular outflow tract, heading to the right atrioventricular groove 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1d]</u>. Three days later, he was discharged without any complications or residual chest pain and was prescribed aspirin, clopidogrel, ramipril, bisoprolol, and atorvastatin.\nMost coronary artery anomalies are asymptomatic and are found incidentally during coronary angiography or computed tomographic coronary angiography. Their prevalence is less than 1.3% based on published studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> An anomalous RCA is rare, with an incidence of less than 3%. Various anomalous origins of the RCA have been reported, including the left anterior sinus with variable courses, ascending aorta above the sinus level, descending thoracic aorta, left main coronary artery, left circumflex coronary artery (LCX), pulmonary arteries, and below the aortic valve.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Among them, an anomalous RCA from the LAD is very rare. Similar to our case, most anomalous RCA courses are anterior to the pulmonary trunk and therefore are clinically benign.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\nThere are several reports on myocardial infarction and PCI involving an anomalous RCA with various origins, including an anteriorly displaced origin within the right coronary sinus, in the ascending aorta, left coronary sinus, and LCX in a dual LAD anomaly.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Commonly noted in these cases were delayed reperfusion due to difficulties in finding the anomalous RCA ostium and more serious sequelae due to technical difficulties during the procedures. It has not been established whether some types of coronary anomalies predispose an artery to atherosclerotic stenosis at the proximal segment.\nAmong the myocardial infarctions observed with coronary anomalies, those involving an anomalous RCA from the LAD are extremely rare. One aspect of the clinical importance of an anomalous RCA arising from the LAD, as in our case, is that accelerated atherosclerosis proximal to the origin of the RCA could jeopardize the myocardium in both the LAD and RCA territory. If total occlusion at the origin of the anomalous RCA is present, making it difficult to intervene in the masked occluded coronary artery, and the operator is not aware of the possibility of anomalies during the coronary angiography, the outcomes will be disastrous.\nOur case is unique in that culprit lesion was located just proximal to the origin of anomalous RCA and it made bifurcation lesion which warranted complex PCI. We implanted stent at proximal-LAD crossing the origin of anomalous RCA, followed by sequential ballooning at RCA and LAD due to slow flow phenomenon.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

This disease could present with different clinical manifestations, which are classified into mucocutaneous (ML), cutaneous (CL) or visceral (VL) form (kala-azar disease), the latter being the most pathogenic and caused by L. donovani in Asia and Africa, and by L. infantum in the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, Central Asia, South America and Central America 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The VL form causes around 20,000 to 40,000 deaths in humans, with 200,000 to 400,000 new infections per year, being one of the most relevant parasitic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Although the parasite has recently been found in different species including reptiles 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>, wild carnivores 通用删除6(英):<u>[6, 7]</u>, wild rabbits 通用删除6(英):<u>[8, 9]</u>, horses 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> and cats 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>, the most relevant host of L. infantum is the dog, where it causes canine leishmaniasis (CanL) 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\nSeroprevalence of L. infantum infection is related to different factors, with controversial results. For example, Gálvez et al. and Rombolà et al. found higher prevalence in males than females, and in younger dogs than older ones, whereas Varjao et al. found no association between seropositivity and sex, but described a higher prevalence in older dogs than younger ones 通用删除6(英):<u>[13, 14, 15]</u>. Different seroprevalence related to canine breed is commonly cited in several papers, with higher prevalence in Doberman Pinscher or Boxer when compared to the autochthonous canine breeds of endemic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[14, 16]</u>. One of them is the Ibizan Hound, an autochthonous canine breed of the Balearic Islands, which appears to be resistant to L. infantum infection compared to other breeds 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. In fact, the study conducted by Solano-Gallego et al. showed a significant cellular response to infection in this canine breed 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Cellular response mediated that Th1 response is related to the production of several cytokines, specifically interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 2 (IL-2), which activate the macrophage that eliminates the parasite 通用删除6(英):<u>[12, 19]</u>. Other cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) activate the Th2 response (humoral immune response) and lead to dissemination of the parasite 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Abbehusen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> related L. infantum infection with CXCL1 production, which produces a cellular immune response and increases levels of several cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-18, whereas TNF-α, IL-2 and IL-8 levels are decreased. Thus, canine breeds resistant to infection could present different levels of cytokines other than IFN-γ, which triggers the Th1 response. Furthermore, the genetic factors associated with cytokine levels and resistance to L. infantum infection have not been studied. A few studies have been carried out in this sense, but none of them related to the Ibizan Hound. Specifically, twenty-four polymorphisms have been analysed in the SLC11A1 gene in 40 dogs of different canine breeds, and two of them were associated with increased risk for CanL 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. The SLC11A1 gene is related to autoimmune and infectious diseases in humans, such as fibrosis progression in hepatitis C, Crohn’s disease, type-1 diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[23, 24, 25, 26]</u>. In L. infantum infection, this gene controls the replication of intracellular parasites 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>, and its haplotypes TAG-9-145 and TAG-8-141 are found more frequently in Boxer dogs than other canine breeds and, given that the CanL is elevated in this breed, the authors conclude that this gene could be related to leishmaniasis susceptibility 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. Quilez et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> conducted a genome-wide association study in the same canine breed and found a region in chromosome 4 which could present several markers with the greatest effect on the susceptible phenotype. However, none of these studies have been able to relate the genetic differences found within the different levels of cytokines in breeds described as resistant or susceptible to the disease.\nThe aim of this work is to analyse the relationship between serum levels of cytokines and the genomic profiles in two canine breeds, Ibizan Hound (resistant canine breed model) and Boxer (susceptible canine breed model).\nInformation on thirty-one Boxer and twenty-eight Ibizan Hound dogs was recorded from animals living in the Valencia Community (Eastern Spain, Mediterranean region). Data and samples were recovered from October 2021 to June 2022. Apparently healthy dogs which had never presented clinical signs were tested for anti-Leishmania specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) (MegaFLUO® LEISH, Megacor Diagnostik GmbH, Hörbranz, Austria). Only animals with IFAT titre < 1/80 were considered seronegative 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> and included in this study. Seven Boxer dogs were positive for IFAT test and excluded from the study. The epidemiological data of animals included are shown in Table 1.\nEpidemiological data of Boxer and Ibizan Hound dogs analysed\n删除重复语句：<u>Epidemiological data of Boxer and Ibizan Hound dogs analysed</u>\nThe epidemiological variables are gender (male or female), age (puppy-less than one year old, young-between one to five years old, adult-between five to ten years old, and elder,-more than ten years old), and diet (fed only commercial feed or not)\nTen millilitres of whole blood were taken by cephalic venipuncture with Vacutainer tubes without anticoagulant. Samples were kept at room temperature to obtain serum aliquots, which were stored at - 20 °C until processing. The whole blood samples were used for DNA isolation within 24 h of extraction.\nThe IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ [Canine IL-2 ELISA kit, Canine IL-6 ELISA kit, Canine IL-8 ELISA kit, and Canine IFN-γ ELISA kit, Invitrogen (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA), respectively], and IL-18 (Canine IL-18 ELISA kit, Mybiosource, San Diego, CA, USA) levels were measured in serum samples using a commercial ELISA method kit following the manufacturer’s recommendations. In brief, a 100 µl sample of serum was used for analysis with the sandwich-ELISA. The microplate had been pre-coated with an antibody specific to cytokines. The sample was added to the microplate wells and combined with the specific antibody. Then, a biotinylated detection antibody specific for each cytokine and Avidin-Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate were added successively to each microplate well and incubated. Free components were washed away. The substrate solution was added to each well. The enzyme-substrate reaction was determined by optical density (OD) and measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm in the plate reader Victor-X3™ (Perkin Elmer®, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The concentration of each cytokine was calculated by comparing the OD of the samples to the standard curve.\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) from samples was isolated using a QIAamp DNA Blood Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (QIAamp; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA was quantified using the Glomax® Discover Fluorimeter and the QuantiFluor® dsDNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The genomic DNA concentrations for all samples were a minimum of 50 ng/µl. DNA samples were whole-genome amplified for 20-24 h at 37 ℃, fragmented, precipitated and resuspended in an appropriate hybridisation buffer.\nFifty-two samples (twenty-four Boxer and twenty-eight Ibizan Hound) were genotyped using the CanineHD DNA Analysis BeadChip WG-440-1001 (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA) and hybridised on the prepared BeadChips for 16-24 h at 48 ℃. Following the hybridisation, non-specifically hybridised samples were removed by washing, while the remaining specifically hybridised loci were processed for the single-base extension reaction, stained, and imaged on an Illumina iScan Reader (iScan® System, San Diego, CA, USA). GenomeStudio 2.0.5 (Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA, USA) was used to process data generated from the iScan system for subsequent analysis, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Intensity data was loaded into the Genotyping Module for primary data analysis, including raw data normalisation, clustering and genotype calling. Single nucleotide polymorphisms on sexual chromosomes and with a call rate < 95% were discarded using PLINK v1.90b6.22 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. The final data set includes 165,480 mapped positions in samples with a mean genotyping rate of 0.988.\nThe homogeneity of epidemiological data of dogs used in the study was evaluated by Fisher’s test analysis. Serum levels of cytokines were analysed using the general linear model procedure (PROC GLM) of the SAS statistical package , after normality and homoscedasticity were tested by Shapiro-Wilks and Levene tests, respectively. The model was implemented with sex, age, and breed as fixed effects. Pearson’s correlations between cytokine levels were carried out. The statistical significance was set at P-value < 0.05.\nPolymorphisms included in each cytokine gene were selected from those genotyped according to the mapping information of the Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly CanFam3.1. Upstream and downstream regions (25 kb) were added to each cytokine gene to include possible regulatory regions in the haplotype analysis 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. PLINK v1.90b6.22 was used to extract variants from the selected genome regions, according to the mapping information of the Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly CanFam3.1. The rsID information was downloaded and annotated from the European Variation Archive EVA release 3 files corresponding to the CanFam3.1 assembly.\nHaplotypes for each sample were inferred using the haplo.stats version 1.8.9 package in Rstudio 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. The haplo.stats software computes scores to evaluate the association of a trait with the inferred haplotypes when the linkage phase is unknown. We used the Haplo.glm extension of haplo.score to perform a GLM regression to estimate the magnitude of individual haplotype effects within each cytokine. The haplotypes with an absolute frequency less than 5 were later dropped by setting the haplo.min.count parameter to 5 for the final analysis to only account for major haplotypes.\nDifferences between cytokine levels were found between the two canine breeds, with IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-18 levels being higher in Ibizan Hound than in Boxer, whereas IL-8 levels were lower in Ibizan Hound than in Boxer (P < 0.05). No statistical differences were found in IL-6 levels between breeds .\nMean levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-18 in Boxer dogs were 0.19 ± 0.05 ng/ml, 46.70 ± 4.54 ng/ml, and 36.37 ± 30.59 pg/ml respectively. In contrast, Ibizan Hound dogs present 0.49 ± 0.05 ng/ml, 64.55 ± 4.54 ng/ml, and 492.10 ± 31.18 pg/ml, respectively. Related to IL-8, the values in Boxer dogs are higher than in Ibizan Hounds, at 230.04 ± 23.11 pg/ml and 136.33 ± 23.55 pg/ml, respectively .\nSerum levels of cytokines analysed in Boxer and Ibizan Hound\n删除重复语句：<u>Serum levels of cytokines analysed in Boxer and Ibizan Hound</u>\np-values < 0.05 are statistically significant and shown in bold\naIFN interferon; IL interleukin\nb Serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-6 were measured in ng/ml, whereas serum levels of IL-8 and IL-18 were measured in pg/ml\nThe complete set of the expected effects of haplotypeserum level interactions under the tested GLM is detailed in 通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Table S2. We found fifteen haplotypes that presented a statistically significant effect on the cytokine serum levels (P < 0.05). These fifteen haplotypes can be divided into two categories: (i) those showing a relative frequency of less than 50% in a specific breed. Thirteen IL8 haplotypes are involved, which are related to IL-8 and IL-18 serum levels. (ii) Those showing relative frequencies above 50% in a specific breed. There are two haplotypes, IL6 (CGAAG) and IFNG (GCA), which present an extended effect on the IL-2, IL-18 and IFN-γ serum values .</u>\nOn the one hand, the IL6-CGAAG haplotype, compared against the basal haplotype IL6-CAAAG (the most frequent haplotype being > 40%), increases the IL-2, IL-8 and IFN-γ serum levels. Having a single copy of the IL6-CGAAG haplotype increases the value of the IL-2 in serum by 10.1 (P < 0.05), increases the value of IL-18 by 176.1 (P < 0.001) and increases the value of IFN-γ by 0.3 (P < 0.01) when compared to a dog being homozygous for the reference haplotype. The IL6-CAAAG allele is almost exclusive to the Ibizan Hound breed, with frequencies above 64% in the IL2, IL8 and IFNG computed interactions.\nOn the other hand, the IFNG-GCA haplotype that was compared against the reference haplotype IFNG-ATG (> 40%) decreases the IL-2, IL-18 and IFN-γ serum levels. Having a single copy of the IFNG-GCA haplotype decreases the value of the IL-2 in serum by 15.8 (P < 0.001), decreases the value of IL-18 by 183.7 (P < 0.001) and decreases the value of IFN-γ by 0.2 (P < 0.05) when compared to a dog that is homozygous for the reference haplotype. The IL6-CAAAG allele is almost exclusive to the Ibizan Hound breed, with frequencies above 68.5%, while IFNG-GCA is almost exclusive to Boxer breed dogs (> 70%) in the IL2, IL8 and IFNG computed interactions.\nFinally, our results 通用删除1(英):<u></u> suggest a moderate effect of IL8 haplotypes on IL-8 and IL-18 serum levels, which could indicate a relationship between resistance or susceptibility to disease.\nThe results of the present work show fifteen haplotypes within genes encoding cytokines that correlated with serum cytokines serum levels in apparently healthy dogs of the two canine breeds. Two of them, located in IFNG and IL6, are statistically correlated with the IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-18 measured serum levels. The IL6-CGAAG are related to increased levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-18, whereas the IFNG-GCA haplotype are related to reduced levels. The frequency of these two haplotypes differs between the two canine breeds, so IL6-CGAAG and IFNG-GCA haplotypes present high frequency in Ibizan Hound and in Boxer, respectively. Consistent with these results, the Ibizan Hounds present higher serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-18 compared to Boxer dogs.\nIFN-γ plays a relevant role in macrophage activation against Leishmania infection via nitric oxide 通用删除6(英):<u>[33, 34, 35]</u>. When IFN-γ binds its receptor on the cell membrane of macrophages, the JAK-STA-1 pathway is activated, inducing IFN-γ stimulated genes 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. Furthermore, several studies indicate that IFN-γ regulates the transcriptional mechanisms by alternative splicing and altering the expression of microRNAs and lncRNAs 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>. Regarding L. infantum, the control of infection requires the activation of T helper 1 (Th-1) cells, which increases the IFN-γ and IL-2 serum levels 通用删除6(英):<u>[37, 38]</u>. The production of these cytokines was correlated with resistance to disease, so IFN-γ has been proposed as biomarker for immune monitoring in canine leishmaniasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[17, 39, 40]</u>, and IL-2 expression was negatively correlated with splenic parasite loads in infected dogs 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. The IL-18, known as IFN-γ inducing factor, increases the production of this interferon by T cells and has a relevant role in the defence against visceral leishmaniasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[42, 43]</u>. According to that, these three cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-18) present high levels in Ibizan Hound dogs, which have a natural resistance against canine leishmaniasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[18, 39, 44, 45]</u>. Our results indicate that these elevated levels are correlated with the IL6-CGAAG haplotype, which is found with a higher frequency in Ibizan Hound dogs compared to Boxers. Different haplotypes of IL6 gene or IL6R genes have been related to IL-6 and other cytokine serum levels in humans, including IL-2, IL-8 and IL-18 cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>[46, 47, 48, 49]</u>, and with the severity or protective effect of the infectious disease, including parasitic diseases. For example, Mendonça et al. Sortica et al. and Wujcicka et al. founded IL6 gene haplotypes related to the severity of the malaria disease and Toxoplasma gondii infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[50, 51, 52]</u>, whereas Chen et al. showed several IL6 haplotypes with protective effect against COVID-19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u>. According to the results of Yang et al. in human, our results show a correlation between IL6 haplotype and serum levels of IL-18, in addition to finding an association with high levels of other cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-2, all of them related to protective effect against L. infantum infection.\nOn the contrary, Boxer dogs present higher frequency of the IFNG-GCA haplotype, which is related to low levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-18. Correlations between IFNG gene haplotypes and low level of cytokines have previously been detected in humans. In fact, da Silva et al. demonstrated a correlation between single haplotype of IFNG and low levels of IFN-γ, associated with the susceptibility to leishmaniasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>. According to these authors, the correlation between IFNG-GCA haplotype and the low levels of IFN-γ was also detected, together with low levels of other cytokines with a protective effect in Leishmania infection, such as IL-2 and IL-18. The IL-2 cytokine is secreted by the Th1 cells and stimulates the production of IFN-γ 通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u>. In fact, treatment of exogenous IL-2 in mice reduced parasitic load, increasing the IFNG expression 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u>. Moreover, the IL-18 cytokine presents a protective effect against visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum infection in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>, inducing IFN-γ and leading to the production of Th1 responses and natural killer (NK) cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>.\nAlthough studies correlating haplotypes of IFNG gene and cytokine levels and/or susceptibility to infectious disease have not yet been carried out in dog, several studies described different haplotypes in this gene as being related to the susceptibility or resistance to infectious diseases in humans, including parasitic infection diseases. For example, some authors associated IFNG haplotypes with the susceptibility to virus infection, such as hepatitis B virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>, T-lymphotropic virus type 1 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u>, or tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[61, 62]</u>, as well as bacterial infections such as brucellosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u>, or parasitic infections such as malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>[64, 65]</u>. Related to leishmaniasis, Kalani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> found several haplotypes in the IFNG gene related to susceptibility and resistance to visceral leishmaniasis in Iran.\nSeveral haplotypes of IL8 gene have been related to susceptibility and severity of different infectious diseases such as tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u>, syncytial virus disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> and hepatitis B 通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u>. In fact, several studies have demonstrated that IL8 haplotypes are related to the susceptibility of infectious diseases, increasing the percentage of ROS-producing monocyte-derived macrophages 通用删除6(英):<u>[70]</u> and increasing the influx of neutrophils in inflammatory lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u>. However, the relationship between IL8 haplotype and cytokine serum levels or susceptibility to Leishmania infection is still unknown. The limited number of dogs included in our study with these haplotypes made it difficult to obtain determinant results. More studies related to these haplotypes and their effect on the severity of diseases are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of susceptibility and resistance to L. infantum in dogs and other mammals, including humans.\nIn this study, haplotypes in the IFNG and IL6 genes have been correlated to serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-18, and a moderate effect on IL8 haplotype correlated to IL-8 and IL-18 serum levels was found. The results indicate that the resistance to L. infantum infection could be a consequence of certain haplotypes with a high frequency in the Ibizan Hound dog breed, while susceptibility to the disease would be related to other specific haplotypes, with high frequency in Boxer. Future studies will be necessary to elucidate the specific biological function of these haplotypes, their relationship with cytokine expression and regulation, and with different stages of disease in dogs and other mammals, including humans.\nTable S1.

The adjusted P value estimated by the Benjamini and Hochberg method 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> was used to adjust for multiple tests.\nAmong the 31 GTEx human tissues, the small intestine, testis, kidneys, heart, thyroid, and adipose tissue had the highest ACE2 expression levels, while blood, spleen, bone marrow, brain, blood vessels, and muscle had the lowest ACE2 expression levels . In the lungs, colon, liver, bladder, and adrenal gland, ACE2 showed medium expression levels . These results suggest that ACE2 is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues in addition to the lungs.\nFurthermore, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database 删除6：<u></u> showed that the ACE2 protein had relatively high expression levels in the duodenum, small intestine, gallbladder, kidneys, testis, seminal vesicle, colon, rectum, and adrenal gland. The HPA database also showed that the gastrointestinal tract (duodenum, small intestine, colon, and rectum), kidney, gallbladder, and male tissues (testis and seminal vesicle) had high expression levels of both ACE2 gene and protein.\nTaken together, these data indicate that: i) SARS-CoV-2 may infect other human tissues in addition to lungs, and ii) males may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than females.\nWe further compared ACE2 expression levels between males and females in 22 individual human tissues using the GTEx datasets and found no statistically significant difference between males and females in any tissue using a threshold of adjusted P value < 0.05 and fold change > 1.5 . We also compared ACE2 expression levels between younger (ages ≤ 49 years) and older (ages > 49 years) populations and did not observe a statistically significant difference between the groups in any tissue with a threshold of adjusted P value < 0.05 and fold change > 1.5 . Likewise, in TCGA datasets, ACE2 was not differentially expressed between males and females or between younger and older groups in any tissue , consistent with the results in GTEx. In TCGA, we also compared ACE2 expression levels between Asian and non-Asian races in five normal tissues (stomach, thyroid, breast, liver, and pancreas), and did not find a significant difference between them in any tissue .\nWe analyzed the correlations between ACE2 expression levels and immune signature enrichment levels (CD8+ T cells, interferon response, B cells, and NK cells) in various male and female human tissues. In the skin, digestive system (esophagus, stomach, colon, and pancreas), brain, and blood vessels, we observed significant positive correlations between ACE2 expression levels and CD8+ T cell enrichment levels in both males and females (Pearson’s correlation test, adjusted P < 0.05, 0.27 ≤ r ≤ 0.78) . In addition, in the thyroid, lungs, adrenal gland, liver, and kidneys, ACE2 expression levels showed significant positive correlations with CD8+ T cell enrichment levels solely in males (0.20 < r < 0.68). However, in the thyroid and lungs, ACE2 expression levels were negatively correlated with CD8+ T cell enrichment levels in females (r = -0.36). In the heart, ACE2 expression levels had a negative and a positive correlation with CD8+ T cell enrichment levels in males (r = -0.23) and females (r = 0.32), respectively. Likewise, the interferon response signature had significant positive correlations with ACE2 expression levels in the skin, digestive system (esophagus, stomach, liver, and pancreas), brain, and blood vessels in both males and females (0.14 ≤ r ≤ 0.75) . In the thyroid, lungs, kidneys, adrenal gland, colon, and bladder, ACE2 expression levels had significant positive correlations with the interferon response signature solely in males (0.32 ≤ r ≤ 0.82). In contrast, in the thyroid, lungs, and colon, ACE2 expression levels were negatively correlated with the interferon response signature in females (-0.26 < r < -0.20). In the heart, ACE2 expression levels had a negative and a positive correlation with the interferon response signature in males (r=-0.18) and females (r= 0.54), respectively. Similar results were observed for B cells and NK cells . Collectively, these results demonstrate the commonality and distinction in the association of ACE2 expression with immune signatures between males and females.\nWe further analyzed the correlations between ACE2 expression and immune signatures in younger and older populations. In most individual tissues, the correlations between ACE2 expression levels and immune signature enrichment levels displayed consistent trends between younger and older populations. However, in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups, respectively . Again, these results suggest the potential difference in the host immune response to coronavirus infection between young and old persons.\nWe analyzed the expression of ACE2, the gene encoding the human host cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, in 31 normal human tissues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating ACE2 expression across a wide variety of human tissues. We found that although the inflammation of the lungs is the primary symptom of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the lungs had moderate expression of ACE2 among all tissues. This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may affect other tissues in addition to the lungs, including male tissues (testis and seminal vesicle). This indication has been confirmed by recent publications 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4]</u>. For example, Holshue et al. uncovered that stool from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that this virus may infect the gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Huang et al. reported the virus-related cardiac injury in five patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. A study of 99 cases of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia revealed the increased susceptibility of males to infection by this virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In fact, many cases of SARS-CoV-2 have reported symptoms outside of pneumonia, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, confusion, headache, and cardiac injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4]</u>. In addition, the predominant symptoms of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 could be attributed to the fact that the respiratory tract is the readiest transmission approach for the virus.\nWe found that ACE2 expression levels showed no significant difference between males and females, between younger and older persons, or between Asian and non-Asian races. This indicates that the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV may have no significant association with sex, age, or race. In fact, like SARS-CoV 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>, SARS-CoV-2 can affect males and females equally and can infect young and old persons equally 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Nevertheless, the mortality risk for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections appears to be associated significantly with sex and age, with a higher risk for males versus females and old versus young populations 通用删除6(英):<u>[3, 14, 16]</u>.\nAdaptive and innate immune responses play an important role in fighting off invading coronavirus, even though they may induce a cytokine storm, which is responsible for the immunopathological damage in patients with coronavirus infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Interestingly, while inflammation of the lungs (pneumonia) is the most common disease caused by coronavirus, the correlations between expression of the ACE2 receptor and immune signatures in the lungs differed between males and females and between young and old persons. This indicates that the host immune response to coronavirus infection could differ between males and females and between young and old persons, partially explaining why males and females and young and old persons have markedly distinct clinical outcomes of coronavirus infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[3, 18]</u>. In addition, it has been demonstrated that lung cells highly expressing ACE2 are more readily infected by SARS-CoV 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. We found that the correlation between ACE2 expression and immune signatures was negative in the lung tissue of females and younger persons, but it was positive in the lung tissue of males and older persons. Collectively, this means that: i) if the lungs highly expressing ACE2 are infected by SARS-CoV-2 in females or young persons, they will have weaker immune signatures, and ii) if the lungs highly expressing ACE2 are infected by SARS-CoV-2 in males or older persons, they will have stronger immune signatures. This suggests that an excessive immune response (cytokine storm or immunopathological damage) could be more likely to occur in males and old persons with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nThis work provides some basis for our next-step investigation of ACE2 expression at protein level. To understand the potential mechanism of interaction between SARS-CoV2 and ACE2, we will explore the possible enrichment and viability of SARS-CoV2 in different tissues alongside different expression level of ACE2. We will try to clarify the survival, death, transfer, and transformation of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissue niches, and explore the virus in vivo inactivation in human body during and after epidemic. In addition, our pilot data suggest that cigarette smoke or nicotine inhalation inhibits the expression of ACE2/AT2R in multiple tissues, including the brain, heart and lungs, thus disrupting the balance within the renin-angiotensin system.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the findings from the bioinformatics analysis need to be further validated by experimental and clinical data. In particular, because mRNA expression pattern of ACE-2 is not necessarily the same as its protein expression pattern across tissues due to some factors probably affecting the mapping from mRNA level to protein level, such as post-translational modification, the validation of our mRNA-based findings at protein level is important and worth further investigation. Second, the tissue mRNA expression did not capture the mRNA expression in individual cell types that would be important for precisely understanding the virus-host interaction. An analysis of the single-cell RNA-Seq data may address this issue. However, because the single-cell RNA-Seq data across such a wide variety of human tissues are lacking, it is not realistic to perform such an analysis. Third, the comparison of ACE2 expression levels between Asian and non-Asian races in TCGA datasets was performed in a small number of samples, and thus the associated results need to be verified in larger populations. Finally, our data cannot explain the epidemic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in that SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent but more infectious than SARS-CoV. An in-depth analysis of the genomic and protein structures of both coronaviruses would warrant exploring the mechanism underlying the epidemic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.\nACE2 is expressed in various human tissues in addition to the lungs, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may infect other tissues aside from the lungs. ACE2 expression levels have no significant differences between males and females, between young and old persons, and between Asian and non-Asian races in various human tissues, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may infect persons with different sexes, ages, and races equally. The correlations between ACE2 expression and immune signatures differ between males and females and between young and old persons in the lungs, indicating that the different host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may partially explaining why males and females and young and old persons infected with this virus have markedly distinct disease severity. This study provides new insights into the role of ACE2 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and insights into understanding the associations of symptoms, sex, age, and race with SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

With improved visualization of the sinonasal cavities, endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has become the standard of care for refractory chronic rhinosinusitis and has proven useful for the management of other pathologies,1,2 including primary malignancies of the paranasal sinuses and skull base.3,4,5,6 Studies have suggested that endoscopic approaches are associated with improved subjective and objective outcomes for these conditions.删除4：<u>7,8,9,10</u>\nComplications of EES are generally rare, with some studies reporting major complication rates of 1% and lower.11,12,13 However, adverse events have been reported, with one of the most common complications being hemorrhage and hematoma formation.14 One rare and notably devastating complication in EES is injury to the internal carotid artery (ICA). Injury to the ICA can result in catastrophic ischemic damage to the brain, cranial nerve palsies, and death. The most common site of damage is the cavernous segment of the ICA, although the risk of certain segments can vary based on anatomical differences.删除4：<u>15,16</u>\nThis review will highlight the incidence and risk factors for ICA injury in EES, and emphasize preventative measures as well as management principles that can be utilized in the event of an ICA injury.\nOverall, injury of the ICA in endonasal endoscopic surgery is rare. Various studies have illustrated an overall incidence rate of 0-0.1%. One study of approximately 5000 patients only identified one case of ICA injury (0.0002%) intraoperatively, while another study of approximately 16,000 surgeries over 30 years identified only four events (0.0003%).17,18 The highest incidence rate reported was approximately 1% in a cohort of 1800 patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas, although a recent international study demonstrated a 0.20% ICA injury rate among over 2000 patients undergoing a transsphenoidal skull base approach.19,20 Finally, a more recent, multi-institutional study identified a 0.004% incidence rate in a cohort of 7160 patients who underwent EES.21 Despite the low incidence of this event, understanding and identifying risk factors for ICA injury is imperative given its potential for catastrophic morbidity and death in the context of EES becoming more widespread.\nWhile a number of studies have examined risk factors for ICA injury, the low incidence of this event limits statistical power to establish clear associations. Most published data on ICA injuries are in the form of case reports or case series, but several meta-analytic and multi-institution studies have been completed in an effort to identify risk factors. In this discussion, we categorize risk factors by subcauses to further differentiate actionable items. Patient-specific factors have been the most commonly identified risk factors for ICA injury in EES. These factors include demographic factors, anatomical variations, diagnosis, pathological characteristics, and previous medical history and treatments. Understanding patient-specific factors are necessary to identify high-risk surgical candidates and consider the risk-benefit analysis of aggressive tumor resections for patients with increased risk for vascular complications. Provider and hospital-specific factors include the surgeon's experience and team, surgical techniques, imaging, and facility volume and ancillary staff.\nAnatomic aberrations may increase the risk of ICA injury during EES. In one multicenter study of ICA injuries during EES, 82% of events involved patients with an anatomic variation of the ICA.21 High-risk variations in anatomy can be present in both the ICA itself as well as surrounding structures that affect the surgical field or displace the ICA. A dehiscent ICA canal can be found in up to 22% of anatomic specimens.22 Incomplete or thin bony coverings over the ICA increase the susceptibility to injury and should thus be dissected carefully if identified on preoperative imaging.\nOther aberrations include lesions displacing the ICA, as well as vessel wall abnormalities (aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, carotid-cavernous fistula, etc.). These aberrations are not uncommon, as over 10% of all intracranial aneurysms are localized to the ICA. Aneurysms are notably more common in patients with pituitary adenomas, theoretically due to increased levels of Insulin-like growth factor 1.23,24 Bulging of the ICA into the superolateral wall of the posterior part of the sphenoid has been noted to occur in over 70% of patients, which should be considered during operative planning.25 Interestingly, bulging of the ICA has been positively associated with the degree of pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus.删除4：<u>26</u>\nSphenoidal septa attaching to the ICA may be associated with the risk of ICA injury.16 Previous studies have established a relationship between sphenoid sinus septations and the ICA in which many intrasphenoidal septa insert at the parasellar or paraclival carotid prominence.27 During dissection, manipulation of these septa can damage the ICA due to their physical attachment to the vessel wall as well as their overall proximity to these structures. A recent study established that 49% of sphenoid sinuses have at least one septum exhibiting involvement with the ICA protuberance.28 A study utilizing 3D-modeling of the sinuses in 260 patients also established a positive relationship between sphenoid sinus volume and septations with ICA injury in endoscopic surgery.29 Dissecting or twisting such septa can potentially damage the ICA.\nFinally, the distance of the ICA canal to the nasopharynx and surrounding structures can also contribute to the risk of ICA injury.30,31 A study of over 300 magnetic resonance imaging scans examined the distance of the ICA canal to the nasopharyngeal subsite, which served as a proxy for \"risk\" of injury.32 This analysis established a relationship between a shortened ICA-nasopharyngeal distance in patients with ICA aberrancy (tortuous, kinked, or coiled), as well as in patients of older age, female gender, and low body weight index. Reduced intercarotid distances can also increase the risk of ICA injury, especially in patients with midline operative windows around the central skull.33,34 Notably, patients with growth-hormone secreting pituitary tumors have been shown to have a reduced intercarotid distance, which should be considered in operative planning.删除4：<u>34,35</u>\nPathologic factors include the nature of the indication for EES. ICA injury is typically reported in studies of oncologic cases; however, events have been reported in other surgeries such as functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).删除4：<u>36</u>\nIf the surgery involves resection of a neoplasm or mass lesion, the size and positioning, including invasion or encasement of the ICA, can substantially influence risk. Notably, anterior cranial fossa lesions carry less risk than lesions of the middle and posterior cranial fossa, where endonasal approaches are extended in the coronal plane and dissection is required in closer proximity to the cavernous, paraclival, and petrous segments of the ICA.37 If the mass lesion displaces the ICA into the surgical corridor, the risk of ICA injury can increase substantially.\nTumor histology and invasiveness can also influence the risk of ICA injury. Chordomas and chondrosarcomas have been shown to increase the risk of ICA rupture due to the displacement of the ICA, destruction of protective periosteum around the cavernous sinus and petrous portion of the ICA, and the need for a more extensive dissection to achieve negative margins.删除4：<u>37</u>\nPrevious surgeries and nonsurgical treatment, notably radiotherapy, can impact the risk for ICA injury. These procedures can affect surrounding tissue through scarring, fibrosis, and osteonecrosis of the protective bone, thereby increasing vulnerability to injury.19,21,38 Bromocriptine use for pituitary tumors has also been established as a risk factor for ICA injury, possibly due to adhesions and fibrosis.删除4：<u>19,37</u>\nThere is a well-established inverse relationship between surgeon experience and complications of skull base procedures.39 However, data supporting a relationship between surgeon experience and ICA injury is limited. One study found a slightly higher rate of ICA injury in the first year of experience, while others illustrated an even distribution of injuries over a surgeon's experience or a higher frequency among experienced surgeons.删除4：<u>21,37,40</u>\nPreoperative imaging and intraoperative devices may also be related to ICA injury. Notably, cases with inadequate imaging for operative planning could lead to ICA injury through the lack of identification of anatomical landmarks or aberrancies. However, a meta-analysis failed to establish a relationship between utilization of imaging and ICA injury, although these results may be underpowered due to the rarity of ICA injury in general.41,42 Calibrated image guidance systems can confirm landmarks and the pathway of the ICA canals, which can improve resection outcomes when vessels may deviate from standard positions. Finally, studies have shown a higher rate of ICA injury when EES involves the use of sharp devices rather than blunt dissection devices,21 and the use of larger burrs when drilling may increase the risk of ICA damage.删除4：<u>21</u>\nProtocols to prevent ICA injury have been adopted by many institutions. Such approaches include preoperative and intraoperative strategies to mitigate risk factors as well as increase the likelihood of successful management of ICA injury. Institutions without these measures have been shown to experience a higher incidence of ICA injury than those with such protocols.删除4：<u>16,21,43</u>\nDue to the complex anatomy and physiologic considerations of skull base surgery, a multidisciplinary approach should always be utilized during EES to prevent ICA injuries. While certain clinical scenarios, such as large invasive tumors, constitute a higher risk than routine procedures like FESS, all members of the operating team should discuss the surgical plan, and ancillary practitioners should be easily contacted (e.g. vascular surgeon, endovascular neurosurgeon) in the setting of a possible ICA complication. Additionally, if the patient is at a considerable risk of ICA injury based on the risk factors listed above, cases should be discussed with a neurointerventional radiologist, endovascular neurosurgeon, and vascular surgeon. The anesthesia team should also be aware and prepared for these complications, and if at high risk, a neuroanethesiologist should be involved in the patient's care. The risk of vascular compromise should be communicated with the anesthesiologist, and blood replacement products and vascular access for transfusion should be secured. Literature has established a benefit of having protocols in place for ICA injury, and that otolaryngologists with formal training in vascular emergencies during EES are better equipped to deal with such events.43 Additionally, technical training using animal models can help prepare surgeons to deal with vascular emergencies in the future.删除4：<u>44</u>\nPreoperative work-up should involve comprehensive imaging of the head and neck, as this not only provides diagnostic value but also reveals important considerations for the surgical approach, including detailed anatomy of the ICA, its course, and any aberrations that may increase the risk of ICA injury. Notably, studies have highlighted the occurrence of ICA injuries in the setting of insufficient imaging.19,21 Primary imaging modalities should include computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, with and without contrast. In more complex cases, especially ones involving mass-lesions, CT and magnetic resonance angiograms can be used to visualize the relationship between the vasculature and the intended surgical approach. Surgeons should consider a balloon-occlusion test in high-risk patients to evaluate the adequacy of collateral vasculature and the viability of sacrificing the ICA in the setting of intraoperative injury or other operative needs.45,46 However, balloon-occlusion testing has a notable false-negative rate (5%-10%) and comes with the risk of dissection, pseudoaneurysm formation, and thromboembolism.47 Therefore, the risks of such a procedure may outweigh potential benefits in low-risk patients. Before operating, standard protocols to reduce bleeding should be implemented, including holding medications that increase the risk of bleeding and communicating the risks and possible complications to the patient and surgical team.\nIntraoperative preparation should include image-guided navigation for select endoscopic procedures.48 Endoscopy provides a two-dimensional view of a three-dimensional space, which results in some perceptual distortion. Real-time intraoperative image guidance mitigates this issue by providing a three-dimensional map of the relevant anatomy. The effects of intraoperative navigation on clinical outcomes remain unclear, but previous studies have demonstrated that its use reduces the number of complications of EES, particularly major complications.41,49 By improving anatomic localization of the ICA and surrounding structures, intraoperative navigation may theoretically reduce the risk of ICA injury. Other preventative intraoperative techniques include acoustic Doppler ultrasound and somatosensory evoked potential monitoring for patients at high-risk of ICA injury.50,51 Utility of these devices in the setting of EES can prevent mechanical injury of vascular structures, especially in close proximity to the intracavernous portion of the ICA where visibility and maneuverability are more difficult.52 Finally, in the setting of a high-risk patient, prepping and draping the neck is helpful if a possible emergency transcervical access to the common, internal, and external carotid arteries is necessary.53 Prepping the abdomen and thigh for fat and muscle harvesting to repair ICA injury may be considered as well.\nIntraoperative management of an ICA injury can prove difficult, as access is limited and high-pressure bleeding can severely impair visibility. The first step should be to maintain visualization of the operative field using suction. A two-surgeon team can prove helpful through dynamic handling of the endoscope and suctioning instruments. Two large-bore suction systems, ideally 12 Fr or larger, should be used to clear the field of blood and allow for adequate visualization of the site of injury to properly manage it. Meanwhile, the surgeon handling the endoscope must maintain the surgical view and appropriate orientation. In skull base surgery, the endoscopist may consider entering the contralateral nasal cavity and using the posterior nasal septal edge as a shield to avoid obscuring the endoscope lens with blood. Integrated endoscope lens cleaning systems can also help maintain visualization of the field. Deliberate hypotension has been previously suggested as a management strategy for patients with carotid artery injury, as this can slow bleeding and help improve visibility.19,54,55 However, many surgeons now recommend maintaining normotension through fluid replacement to maintain contralateral cerebral perfusion and prevent ischemic neurologic sequelae.删除4：<u>36,56</u>\nAfter bleeding of the ICA is identified and properly visualized, hemostatic control should be achieved as quickly as possible. One strategy is to pack the surrounding area to tamponade the vascular injury. Various materials have been used for this purpose, including gauze, cotton pledgets, fibrin glue, gel foam, cellulose packing, and Teflon and methyl methacrylate. The choice of material ultimately depends on surgeon preference and the size of the vascular injury. However, excessive packing can prevent the surgeon from relocating the source of bleeding and may result in occlusion and stenosis of the ICA or compression of the basilar artery.19,57 Certain topical agents, such as Floseal (Baxter International Inc.), a thrombin-gelatin matrix, can aid in hemostatic control without requiring tamponade, although high-pressure arterial bleeding is unlikely to resolve from such matrices alone. Another option is the crushed muscle patch, which may be harvested from the sternocleidomastoid muscle, crushed with a mallet, and placed over the injury without direct tamponade.58,59 Additionally, direct closure may be achieved using Debakey-style clamps and sutures, such as the U-clip anastomotic device, which employs a self-closing wire that obviates the need for endoscopic knot tying.59 In a study comparing the efficacy of five hemostatic agents (Floseal, Chitosan gel, oxidized regenerated cellulose, muscle patch, or U-Clip sutures) in sheep models, the muscle patch and U-clip were the most effective at achieving rapid hemostasis and minimizing blood loss.删除4：<u>58</u>\nOne management technique that has fallen out of favor is surgical ligation of the ICA. While this was historically the technique of choice, studies have illustrated a higher incidence of stroke and death using this strategy, especially in the setting of patients with insufficient or unknown collateral circulation.60 Even in those with adequate collaterals, the bleeding is still likely to be rapid and disorienting. Ligation also limits the extent of further management by the interventional radiologist.\nAfter temporary hemostatic control is achieved, the patient should be immediately transferred to the angiography suite. Even for patients with successful hemostasis, angiography should be conducted promptly to effectively characterize the extent of the carotid injury. Current endovascular techniques, including balloon and coil embolization as well as stent-graft placement to a lesser degree, may prove useful in achieving hemostasis.61 The presence of collateral cerebral flow should also be assessed using MR angiography or other imaging modalities. If there is inadequate collateral flow, endovascular or surgical bypass is the necessary next step.\nLastly, postoperative management and monitoring are important to be kept in mind, as ICA complications may occur after a seemingly uneventful surgery. For example, delayed formation and rupture of pseudoaneurysm in the ICA, occurring days to years after the original procedure, has been described in multiple case reports.16,19 Thus, all patients with ICA injury should undergo active follow-up with regular angiographic screening.\nICA injury is a potentially catastrophic complication of EES. Fundamentally, the focus should be placed on prevention, as this is the best way to optimize patient outcomes. Identifying patients with notable risk factors and obtaining the appropriate preoperative imaging for surgical planning are key prevention efforts. Of the risk factors mentioned in this review, the most pertinent are anatomic aberrations that distort the normal characteristics of the ICA by displacement, encasement, or invasion. Finally, if faced with an ICA injury, having the appropriate equipment, team members, and preparation can help reduce morbidity and mortality from such a catastrophic event.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Moreover, the combination of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics could further enable a comprehensive understanding of psoriasis in terms of systems biology 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nMetabolomics analysis was first based on metabolic profiling using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), a technique widely used in laboratory diagnosis and clinical examinations.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> The advent of high-performance liquid chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technologies has allowed the further exploration of how drugs are metabolized in the body.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16,17]</u> Nowadays, liquid chromatography-MS technology has revolutionized metabolomics analyses, leading to the discovery of new biomarkers.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Therefore, our understanding of systems biology is deepening, and the recognition of diseases is becoming more holistic.\nMetabolomics is a new branch of systems biology that follows genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,18,19]</u> The advantages are as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> subtle changes at the gene and protein expression levels may be amplified at the metabolite level; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> there is no need to establish a large database of expression sequence tags or carry out extensive whole-genome sequencing; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> it is now generally accepted that metabolites can effectively reflect the phenotype and state of an organism, and that metabolites can be not only functional and signaling molecules but also biomarkers; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the number of metabolite species is theoretically much smaller than the number of gene and protein species. Although great progress has been made in metabolomics research, there remain shortcomings that need to be addressed.\nMetabolomics studies using skin lesion samples may provide the most direct and intuitive metabolic changes in local areas. The advantage is that this may promote the integration of metabolite information with local pathological changes, local inflammatory immune responses, and cell proliferation. Moreover, it may play an important role in the discovery of new topical therapeutic targets and the evaluation of the efficacy of existing topical drugs.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u> However, psoriasis is a systemic disease, and its metabolic changes are not only local but also systemic. Metabolomics based on peripheral blood can provide an overall picture of how psoriasis affects metabolic pathways in the body. Although it can be difficult to determine the specific cause or final result of the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the utilization of blood samples has particular advantages in that it may contribute to the development of a holistic view of the relationship between psoriasis and metabolism. Urine is also a useful sample for metabolomics research. Its advantages lie mainly in convenience of access, non-invasive collection, and abundant content of in vivo metabolites and non-cellular products.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> However, few metabolomics studies involving psoriasis have adopted urine as a sample source.\nTo date, some studies have used metabolomics techniques for the analysis of peripheral blood, skin lesions, and urine in patients with psoriasis to determine changes in carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides. These four molecular classes are not only independent of each other but also interconnected. Nutrient metabolism not only affects the supply of energy for cell proliferation but is also involved in a variety of inflammatory and immune processes in the body. We summarized data into four categories 通用删除1(英):<u>(glucose metabolism 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A392]</u>, lipid metabolism 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 2, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A392]</u>, amino acid metabolism 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 3, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A392]</u>, and nucleotide metabolism 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 4, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A392]</u>)</u> to demonstrate the overall metabolic network.\nThe association of psoriasis with abnormal glucose metabolism has been identified in previous epidemiological studies and clinical observations.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> The presence of insulin resistance as well as the abnormal function of glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins has been confirmed in patients with psoriasis, and several genetic psoriasis susceptibility motifs (PSORS, PSORS2, PSORS3, and PSORS4) have been found to be associated with susceptibility loci in multiple metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> However, the mechanism by which glucose metabolism (including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, anaerobic glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and oxidative respiratory chain) is involved in the regulation of psoriasis remains to be further studied.\nIn a metabolomics study using NMR spectroscopy, Sitter et al通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> identified a decrease in glucose levels in psoriatic lesions that may be related to the need to consume more glucose for energy supply when the epidermis overproliferates.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww. com/CM9/A392 shows that levels of glucose metabolism-related metabolites are always decreased in psoriatic lesions or psoriasis-like inflammation samples. Anaerobic glycolysis may permanently be in a state of overconsumption in lesions. Moreover, reduced levels of the substrates and products of anaerobic enzymes (such as myoinositol and lactic acid) have been detected.通用删除6(英):<u>[21,24]</u> It has been hypothesized that the reduction of lactic acid in local lesions may be due to metabolic changes in sweat glands and keratinocytes or the obstruction of sweat ducts.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>\nAlonso et al通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> applied proton NMR technology to analyze urine metabolites from patients with psoriasis as well as patients with several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), coeliac disease, and ulcerative colitis. Compared with healthy controls, patients with psoriasis were found to have lower levels of citrate, alanine, and methylsuccinate.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> The authors also performed a subsequent clustering analysis of metabolites. The profile of psoriasis (together with psoriatic arthritis) was different to that of RA, which may be beneficial for differential diagnosis in the future.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>\nIn contrast with the metabolites detected in lesions and urine, the levels of the substances involved in glucose metabolic circulation in peripheral blood demonstrated an increasing trend. Multivariate analyses showed a higher level of α-ketoglutaric acid, lactic acid, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid in patients with psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,26,27]</u> All these acids could be mobilized into the peripheral circulation due to the increased energy requirements associated with rapid protein synthesis and cytokine production under cellular hyperproliferation. In addition, α-ketoglutarate participates in the synthesis of proline in downstream reactions, which is one of the main raw materials for the synthesis of skin collagen. In contrast, peripheral circulating lactate levels are significantly elevated, presumably relating to the provision of a favorable microenvironment for keratinocyte proliferation. In the context of the inflammatory environment and high oxidative stress, asparagine can spontaneously deamidate and decompose to aspartate in circulation.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) may be involved in worsening insulin resistance.通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29,30]</u> Furthermore, high intake of BCAAs in a high-fat diet may interfere with the normal physiological abilities of insulin in the body.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>\nExcess free fatty acids in the circulation can produce cytotoxic effects on pancreatic β-cells, disrupting their normal physiological function and leading to insulin resistance, further affecting the vasodilatory function and disrupting the vascular endothelial system.通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32,33]</u> Adipocytes under prolonged hypoxic conditions can secrete multiple inflammation-associated cytokines (eg, interleukin 6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) to trigger a range of inflammatory responses.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Lipids are not only the main components that constitute the structure of the bilayer cell membrane, they are also involved in regulating various biological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Therefore, some lipid metabolites may be potential biomarkers. It is currently thought that the major alterations in lipid metabolites may occur mainly through increased lipid synthesis, impaired lipolysis, and excessive activation of the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway.\nA non-targeted lipidomic study based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS analyzing plasma from patients with psoriasis, with validation occurring via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed that the levels of glycerophospholipid pathway metabolites significantly changed (higher lysophosphatidic acid [LPA], lysophosphatidylcholine [LPC], and phosphatidic acid levels, and lower phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidyl choline levels).通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>\nHemolipophosphate family members act as receptor-active mediators in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> LPA and LPC are thought to be inflammatory lipids associated with multiple immune-mediated diseases.通用删除6(英):<u>[36,37,38]</u> LPC exerts proinflammatory effects in inflammatory cells through different signaling pathways (eg, nuclear factor kappa B, protein kinase C, and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathways). Furthermore, LPC induces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, a key proinflammatory mediator.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> LPA promotes cell growth, differentiation, and mastocyte proliferation during inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[40,41]</u> and is not only involved in constituting the skeletal structure of the cell membrane, but also acts as a secondary messenger mediating downstream signaling pathways.通用删除6(英):<u>[42,43,44]</u>\nIn the serum lipid metabolites of patients with psoriasis, unsaturated fatty acids show an overall decreasing trend. Serum levels of crotonic acid, 2-hydroxysebacic acid, and 13-octadecenoic acid also decrease.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Unsaturated fatty acids not only prevent thrombosis by reducing platelet aggregation and blood viscosity, but also improve the lipid profile (increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but reducing serum triglycerides and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Besides, unsaturated fatty acids may indirectly contribute to the occurrence of chronic inflammation through their negative effects on the lipid profile and blood vessels.通用删除6(英):<u>[45,46]</u>\nStudies have also confirmed the upregulation of lipid peroxidation and reduction of antioxidant markers (such as glutathione) in plasma. Elevated levels of azelaic acid (the final product of linoleic acid after peroxidation decomposition) have been observed in blood samples.通用删除6(英):<u>[27,35]</u> However, there remains controversy regarding whether hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde can be used as biomarkers for psoriasis, as very different results have emerged from different studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[47,48]</u>\nIn psoriatic lesions, the levels of unsaturated fatty acids differ significantly. Of these, all products of lipoxygenase (LOX) are abundant and involve monohydroxy derivatives from arachidonic acid (5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12-, and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [HETE]) and linoleic acid (9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid [HODE]).通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> These lipids have specific physiological functions in the epidermis. For example, 13-HODE is thought to have anti-inflammatory effects and the ability to maintain normal keratinogenic cell proliferation.通用删除6(英):<u>[49,50]</u> 9-HODE promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines.通用删除6(英):<u>[35,51]</u> However, the amount of 13-HODE produced by the psoriatic epidermis is not sufficient to inhibit the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Similarly, 12-HETE is a proinflammatory chemotactic agent,通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u> whereas 15-HETE reduces inflammatory cell infiltration. However, 15-HETE is higher in psoriatic lesions than 12-HETE.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> LOX oxidation products are further oxidized to produce epoxides, such as epoxy octadecadienoic acid and epoxy eicosatrienoic acid. These epoxides may promote neutrophil infiltration and inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[53,54]</u>\nCholine not only provides the energy needed for cell growth and division but is also involved in the synthesis of bioactive lipids. Elevated choline levels in psoriatic lesions may indicate the local hyperproliferation of epidermal cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[21,24]</u> Taurine is abundant in inflammatory cells, such as leukocytes, and is also abundant in local inflammatory lesions and oxidative stress tissues.通用删除6(英):<u>[21,55,56,57]</u> LPC has elevated levels in both lesions and serum and is presumably involved locally in the induction of lymphocyte and macrophage migration as well as increased production of proinflammatory cytokines.通用删除6(英):<u>[34,58]</u>\nThe level of tetranor-12(S)-HETE is elevated, whereas that of 12(S)-HETE is reduced in the urine of patients with psoriasis. 12(S)-HETE is involved in the regulation of skin homeostasis and affects the growth and differentiation of keratinocytes. Dermatologic inflammation may also accelerate beta-oxidation.通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>\nThe importance of amino acids and their metabolites lies in providing the raw material for cellular protein biosynthesis, forming cytoskeletons, and participating in a variety of bioactive reactions. Glutamine and asparagine levels are lower in patients with psoriasis than in those without. However, levels of alpha-ketoglutarate are higher in patients with psoriasis vulgaris but lower in those with psoriatic arthritis. This suggests that glutamine consumption may increase due to overactive immune cell proliferation. However, the decrease in asparagine is due to spontaneous deamidation and catabolism in an inflammatory, oxidative stress environment. α-Ketoglutarate is involved in the synthesis of proline, a major substrate for collagen synthesis, and in the oxidative supply of the tricarboxylic acid cycle as a citric acid cycle intermediate.通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u> Therefore, levels of alpha-ketoglutarate are elevated in patients with psoriasis but reduced in those with psoriatic arthritis, presumably due to the excessive proliferation of keratinocytes and decreased collagen synthesis.\nAt the same time, patients with psoriasis have more active urea circulation. During the development of psoriasis, which is characterized by the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, the increased demand for polyamines may prompt the release of the three intermediates of the urea cycle (arginine, ornithine, and citrulline) into the peripheral circulation.通用删除6(英):<u>[27,61]</u> Phenylalanine is a raw material that takes part in synthesizing adrenaline, thyroxine, and melanin in the body. Since the accelerated metabolism caused by psoriasis is not only manifested in the skin but also in systemic metabolism, it is believed that the elevated plasma levels of phenylalanine in patients with psoriasis may be related to increased demand for synthetic neurotransmitters and hormones.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Keratinization of the epidermis requires scaffold and supporting proteins (eg, small proline-rich protein). Additionally, the main amino acids involved in the synthesis of human collagen 1α are glycine and proline. Although dermal collagen is not obviously thickened, there are indications of a higher collagen conversion rate in patients with psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[61,62]</u>\nBCAAs are involved in extrahepatic oxidative metabolism (mainly in muscle). BCAAs include leucine (a ketogenic amino acid), valine (a glycosylated amino acid), and isoleucine (a glycosylated and ketogenic amino acid). BCAAs affect metabolism in the following ways: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> promoting the release of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and growth hormone (pro-synthesis); 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> regulating the metabolism of other amino acids, especially aromatic amino acids; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> participating in cellular peroxidative damage resistance.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,63,64]</u> BCAA levels are elevated in the plasma of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease通用删除6(英):<u>[65,66,67,68]</u> and also in patients with psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[27,69,70,71]</u> Considering the link between psoriasis and its systemic metabolic comorbidities, the metabolism of BCAAs in patients with psoriasis deserves further exploration. Interestingly, BCAAs activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an atypical serine/threonine kinase that promotes cell proliferation, survival, protein synthesis, and the growth and proliferation of epithelial cells. This allows BCAAs to play an important role in tumor therapy as a potential therapeutic agent.通用删除6(英):<u>[64,72]</u>\nIn addition, significant alterations in homocysteine metabolism have been detected in plasma, and homocysteine is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events.通用删除6(英):<u>[73,74]</u> Elevated plasma homocysteine levels in patients with psoriasis are presumed to be related to induced oxidative stress and vascular endothelial inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u> Homocysteine causes the accumulation of asymmetrical dimethyl arginine (ADMA; a potent endogenous nitric oxide synthase [NOS] inhibitor). The inhibitory effect of ADMA on cutaneous NOS reduces epidermal nitric oxide (NO), thereby promoting the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. This inhibitory effect on endothelial NOS may lead to increased cardiovascular risk in patients with psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[75,76,77,78]</u>\nPsoriasis is characterized by hyperactive keratinocyte proliferation and by an increased demand for glutamine to adapt to higher protein synthesis rates and to promote more glutamate mobilization locally.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,26]</u>\nTryptophan and phenylalanine are essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized in vivo. The production and accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon gamma (IFN-Υ) and TNF-α, in psoriatic inflammatory lesions could stimulate the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, which, as an important cofactor with phenylalanine, promotes the synthesis of neurotransmitters. This may drive the matching-quantity phenylalanine to be moved locally.通用删除6(英):<u>[79]</u> In addition, the phenylalaninetyrosine pathway is involved in the production of increased melanin in the inflammatory context, which may explain the local accumulation of phenylalanine in inflammatory lesions.通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u>\nThe metabolism of the urea cycle in lesions is different to that in the peripheral circulation. In lesions, the level of ornithine, as a substrate for polyamine synthesis, increases with the increase in demand. Meanwhile, the increased ornithine level upregulates the activity of arginidase, leading to an excessive consumption of arginine as a substrate.通用删除6(英):<u>[81,82]</u> At this point, citrulline levels are also reduced, and this decrease is most pronounced in the hyperproliferating epidermis.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Moreover, arginidase-1 can compete with inducible NOS (iNOS) for arginine, further reducing the levels of this amino acid in skin lesions; at the same time, arginase-1 inhibits iNOS synthesis of NO, further promoting epidermal proliferation.通用删除6(英):<u>[81]</u>\nBecause the epidermis of patients with psoriasis is rapidly proliferating and differentiating, alterations in nucleotide metabolism in the peripheral circulation are mainly manifested in reduced levels of metabolites (ie, aspartic acid, glutamine, hypoxanthine, pseudouridine, inosine, guanosine, cystine, cysteine, and phosphoric acid) due to increasing demand for raw materials, and in product accumulation due to hypercatabolism of purines and pyrimidines.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27,35,61,62,83]</u>\nIn nucleotide metabolism, one carbon unit is synthesized and transferred. Serine, glycine, histidine, and tryptophan are sources of carbon units required for purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Elevated levels of these amino acids in patients with psoriasis may be associated with overactive cell proliferation. The one-carbon unit metabolism inhibitor methotrexate can block DNA synthesis by inhibiting the cycle of the one-carbon unit transporter tetrahydrofolate.通用删除6(英):<u>[84,85,86]</u> The methionine cycle provides methyl groups, where S-adenosylmethionine is the direct donor and N5-CH3-FH4 is the indirect donor. Methyl groups are involved in the methylation of DNA, RNA, and histones, which regulate gene expression at the epigenetic level and influence disease phenotypes. Methyl groups are also involved in other metabolic pathways, such as lipid synthesis and protein synthesis pathways.通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u> Reduced levels of methionine in the peripheral blood of patients with psoriasis may be associated with an increasing demand for raw materials in the activation of the methionine cycle.通用删除6(英):<u>[83]</u> Physiological functions of cystine and cysteine include the production of active sulfate (3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate), which is involved in biological transformation, and the production of glutathione, which is involved in detoxification and antioxidant reactions in vivo, which may also be associated with psoriasis-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, since methionine is converted into cystine and cysteine, it cannot be synthesized in vivo, which further reduces its levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[84,87]</u>\nPsoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease centered on T cell immunity. Metabolic abnormalities in patients with psoriasis may also have an impact on the inflammatory immune response. The association between metabolites and psoriasis is not limited to energy generation, storage, and transmission, or to the synthesis and assembly of the cytoskeleton and its components, but is also reflected in the activation of several genes and the regulation of their expression. This association is also detected in the regulation of components of diverse signal transduction pathways.通用删除6(英):<u>[88,89]</u>\nDifferent from T effector (Teff) cells, T memory (Tm) cells do not absorb extracellular palmitate but initiate de novo synthesis of fatty acids instead.通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u> Moreover, the fatty acid catabolism algebraic approach differs for different T cell subtypes, with Tm cells utilizing lysosomal acidic lipase (LAL)-dependent fatty acid β-oxidation. The loss of LAL activity only reduces the survival rate of Tm cells and does not affect Teff cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u> It also provides useful information regarding the importance of fatty acid metabolism in producing immune memory.\nFatty acids also regulate the activation of immune cells and binding to specific receptors. The activation of T cell receptors is accompanied by the upregulation of genes related to the fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis process regulated by sterol regulatory element binding protein.通用删除6(英):<u>[91]</u>\nAfter stimulation by IFN and toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) ligands, spermidines are reduced and metabolism shifts from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Supplementation with arginine inhibits glycolysis both in vivo and in vitro, prevents IFN-induced dendritic cell (DC) overactivation, and reduces inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[92]</u>\nShort- and medium-chain fatty acids can affect the differentiation of T helper (CD4+) cells in T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells by downregulating histone deacetylase activity and activating the mTOR pathway.通用删除6(英):<u>[93]</u> Fatty acids and their metabolites activate different cell signal transduction pathways by binding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which are important for the differentiation of several T cell subsets,通用删除6(英):<u>[94]</u> particularly in the regulation of CD4+ cell differentiation in Th17 or T regulatory (Treg) cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[95]</u> In addition, PPARs are critical for the activity of adipose tissue-associated Treg cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[96]</u>\nTeff and Treg cells exhibit different metabolic preferences during differentiation, with Teff cells preferring glycolytic action, whereas Treg cells are more dependent on lipid oxidation.通用删除6(英):<u>[97]</u>\nDirect exposure to palmitate leads to a change in the differentiation of CD4+ cells, resulting in an abnormal expansion of the proinflammatory effector and memory lymphocyte population in patients with obesity.通用删除6(英):<u>[98]</u> These abnormal T lymphocytes migrate to non-lymphoid inflammatory sites and maintain chronic inflammation for a long time.\nUnsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) can reduce the number of effector and memory CD4+ cells, prevent T cell polarization and ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 activation, and inhibit the migration of CD4+ cells to the inflammation sites.通用删除6(英):<u>[99]</u> Besides, EPA and DHA increase the infiltration of CD4+ and cytotoxic T cells in the skin under ultraviolet exposure.通用删除6(英):<u>[100]</u>\nIn addition, sphingol-1-phosphate (S1P) is associated with T cell migration. Each of the five different S1P receptors plays a unique role in proliferation, convergence, efflux, and transportation. S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) can downregulate iNOS signals and enhance the formation of anti-inflammatory phenotypes in macrophages. S1PR2 and S1PR3 are necessary for macrophage recruitment.通用删除6(英):<u>[101]</u> Moreover, S1P can inhibit 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced T cell proliferation.通用删除6(英):<u>[102,103]</u> One of the unique pathological manifestations of psoriasis is the aggregation of neutrophils in the epidermis (namely, Munro microabscesses). Ceramides can monitor neutrophil function by inhibiting superoxide production, particularly controlling the response to TNF-α, and can block respiratory bursts in neutrophils caused by N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine stimulation.通用删除6(英):<u>[104,105]</u>\nLPC can activate transcription factors through a combination of G protein-coupled receptors and TLRs. LPC may then increase the expression of target genes to activate inflammatory signaling pathways and increase inflammatory factor release. In addition, LPC is involved in inducing apoptosis and promoting reactive oxygen species production to enhance oxidative stress.通用删除6(英):<u>[58,106]</u>\nCeramide plays an important role in DC activation. First, it induces DC apoptosis by downregulating survival signaling pathways, such as NF-κB and protein kinase B (PKB).通用删除6(英):<u>[106]</u> In addition, ceramides may participate in the induction of DC maturation and promote the production of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12 and TNF-α.通用删除6(英):<u>[107]</u> Moreover, S1P has anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the production of IL-12 and IL-23 by the shared p40 subunit in DCs, thereby inhibiting DC crosstalk with activated keratinogenic cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[108]</u>\nExcess circulating amino acids may stimulate the mTOR/S6 kinase (S6K) pathway and inhibit serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, resulting in impaired glucose tolerance and inhibition of insulin-mediated gluconeogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[109]</u> Insulin resistance plays an inducing and exacerbating role in the chronic inflammatory state of psoriasis. The increased levels of circulating amino acids observed by metabolomics suggest that the mTOR/S6K pathway may contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[110]</u>\nIn addition, short-chain fatty acids have therapeutic potential for psoriasis. Topical application of short-chain fatty acids reduces imiquimod-induced inflammation by downregulating IL-17 and inducing the transcription of IL-10 and forkhead box P3. Short-chain fatty acids can also normalize the reduced Treg inhibitory activity in peripheral blood isolated from patients with psoriasis and reduce the number of Tregs in psoriatic lesions.通用删除6(英):<u>[111]</u>\nTransporters are proteins responsible for transporting metabolic substrates across cell membranes, which can affect metabolite levels, metabolic balance, and immunity. Transportation-mediated uptake, utilization, and catabolism of metabolites can greatly affect the function, balance, activation, and differentiation of immune cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[112]</u> Immune metabolism is essential for immunity and immune responses, and metabolite transporter proteins may be suitable targets for regulating the metabolic phenotype of immune cells.\nGLUT1 is the major GLUT in T cells and plays a regulatory role in their activation and differentiation.通用删除6(英):<u>[113]</u> The transport of glucose via GLUT1 is considered to be a rate-limiting step in the glucose metabolism of T cells. T cell activation leads to increased energy demand, and GLUT1 and GLUT3 mediate increased glucose uptake, thereby enhancing glycolysis to maintain T cell activation and promote differentiation.通用删除6(英):<u>[112]</u> In addition, GLUT can influence the selection of T cell differentiation profiles. Transgenic expression of GLUT1 promotes the activation of T cells and the generation of memory phenotype-like T cells that are prone to activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[97]</u>\nIn addition to glucose metabolism, T cells use glutamine breakdown to meet their considerable energy and biosynthetic needs. The expression of glutamine transporter protein and glutamine catabolic components induces T cell activation via an MYC-dependent pathway.通用删除6(英):<u>[114]</u>\nIncreased expression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) was detected in keratinocytes and lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions. Inhibition of LAT1 prevents the proliferation of human gammadelta T cells and inhibits the secretion of IL-17. In addition, inhibition of LAT1 effectively controls IL-23- and IL-1β-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB/mTOR activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[115]</u>\nRapid developments in metabolomics have upended the traditional view of metabolites as simply energy sources. Indeed, metabolites can act as signaling molecules, immunomodulators, and stress sensors, and play an important role in the onset and development of psoriasis. Metabolomics not only provides a more unified and holistic understanding of physiological metabolism and pathophysiology, but also demonstrates new potential for clinical applications in psoriasis (eg, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis).\nThe increased levels of amino acids in the urea cycle (ornithine, arginine, and citrulline) and collagen synthesis (proline and hydroxyproline) in serum, and glutamate and choline in psoriatic lesions are considered to be associated with the severity of psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[21,61]</u> Moreover, hydroxyproline may be a new indicator of psoriatic arthritis.通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u>\nSitter et al通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> compared metabolite profiles between patients with normal skin, psoriatic lesions, and lesions treated with external corticosteroids. After topical treatment with corticosteroids, glucose, inositol, glycerophosphate choline, and glycine levels increased in the lesions, while choline levels decreased. The levels of metabolites were comparable to those of the normal control, which demonstrated its good therapeutic effect.\nPlasma concentrations of glutamine, threonine, ornithine, arginine, methionine, glycine, citrulline, and proline in patients with psoriasis can reach normal levels in healthy individuals after etanercept treatment, reversing most of the circulating metabolite trends.通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> Kapoor et al通用删除6(英):<u>[116]</u> analyzed different changes in the urinary metabolic profile of patients with psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with infliximab or etanercept. The levels of citrate and lactate in the urine of patients treated with infliximab were elevated, whereas patients receiving etanercept therapy had elevated choline and creatine levels. The elevated choline levels suggest that etanercept may regulate lipid metabolism in vivo.通用删除6(英):<u>[116]</u> Although both infliximab and etanercept have been considered primary targets of TNF-α, the differences in this study suggest that there may still exist a different mechanism between the two biological agents in terms of their effects. The results of a study by Madsen et al通用删除6(英):<u>[83]</u> suggest that psoriasis and RA have unique metabolite profiles, although they share common inflammatory cytokines and signal transduction pathways. Metabolomics is of great clinical value for psoriasis diagnosis and treatment, including its application in developing individualized therapeutic plans and predicting efficacy.\nRecently, non-targeted metabolomics has shown that (R)-salbutamol can alleviate psoriasis-like inflammation by affecting three different metabolic pathways, including glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid, and arachidonic acid metabolism, modulating Th17 and Treg responses, which may provide new directions for developing treatments.通用删除6(英):<u>[117]</u> Oral dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has been approved by the European Union for the treatment of psoriasis.

The complexity of biological samples and metabolites means metabolomics places high demands on the sensitivity, resolution, dynamic range, and flux size of analytical techniques. Therefore, in-depth studies must rely on evolving analytical techniques. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Expansion of the metabolome space: this is mainly reflected in inadequate coverage (ie, low sensitivity and matrix effects). The development of metabolomics is somewhat constrained by the continued lack of functional metabolite databases and uniform common research standards for metabolomics. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> The link between metabolomics data and biomedicine is easily confused. Some metabolites are often associated with different types of diseases, which can create confusion and mistrust of metabolomics data and hinder the development of metabolomics in other fields. 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Some biomarkers are generic for inflammation-related diseases. Research should focus on exploring biomarkers specific for psoriasis. 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> The clinical application of metabolomics still requires validation by orthogonal analysis techniques.\nUnderstanding the effects of metabolism alterations on patients with psoriasis at a holistic level requires the integration of metabolomics and other \"-omics,\" such as proteomics and genomics.通用删除6(英):<u>[69,128]</u> The integration of high precision, high throughput \"-omics\" techniques and bioinformatics allows the consideration of genetic, environmental, inflammatory, diet, immune, and microbial influences on the disease process at multiple levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[129,130]</u> New models have been developed, such as mergeomics,通用删除6(英):<u>[131,132]</u> which aims to integrate multidimensional data for exploring meaningful biological pathways and signal networks,通用删除6(英):<u>[133]</u> and skinomics, which uses microarrays as the primary technical means.通用删除6(英):<u>[134]</u> These new algorithms and models emphasize the concept of \"systematic\" and \"holistic\" in psoriasis research.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,135]</u>\nThe efficacy and safety of targeted biomarker-based treatments have been well established, and metabolomics may assist with developing new therapeutic targets.通用删除6(英):<u>[131,136,137,138]</u> The correlation between psoriatic disease severity and metabolite level suggests that metabolic changes may reflect the trajectory of disease progression, indicating an important role in monitoring and predicting efficacy.通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> In addition, metabolomics continues to evolve with the emergence of new technologies. At present, metabolites can be analyzed in single cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[139]</u> In addition, metabolic pathways can be monitored with stable isotope tracers to further clarify metabolic networks in disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[140,141]</u>\nThere is currently a growing interest in the use of metabolomics techniques in developing treatments for psoriasis. The levels of metabolites in body fluids or skin tissues are considered to reflect the functional state of the cells, providing markers for assessing disease activity and predicting disease progression. Metabolomics has great potential for assisting in the understanding of altered cellular functions, exploring complex signaling pathways, and discovering emerging drug targets. In addition, psoriasis is a genetically related, multifactorial, and systemic autoimmune disease. As each patient’s genetic information and metabolic profile are different, strategies for integrating metabolomics with other technologies may be beneficial for developing individualized therapies. Metabolomics provides in-depth information regarding the association between metabolic state and disease, providing strong support for developing individualized management plans for patients with psoriasis. As metabolomics technology continues to evolve and our understanding of metabolic disorders also deepens, it is reasonable to expect that more diagnostic and therapeutic targets will emerge and be translated into clinical practice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The estimated prevalence varies with a reported 1:10,000 individuals in the United States and 1:50,000 in Denmark. It may be underestimated because of underdiagnosis of mild phenotype. CdLS patients have a distinguishing facial appearance, namely synophrys joining at the midline and with an arched appearance of the eyebrows, thick, and long eyelashes, extending down to the bridge of the nose, long prominent philtrum with down-turned lip corners short and flattened nose, hirsute forehead, and cutis marmorata. Besides, prenatal/postpartum growth retardation, cognitive impairment, psychomotor delay, and behavioral problems such as repetitive and self-injurious behaviors are also remarkable in CdLS patients. Moreover, malformations of other organs have also been reported including the genitourinary system, the cardiovascular system, and the skeletal system.\nCdLS is a rare multisystem genetic disease mainly caused by the mutations of genes code for cohesion system including SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, NIPBL, and HDAC8.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Cohesion plays a key role in the maintenance of genomic stability, as it is involved in the regulation of gene expressing, DNA repair, sister chromatid cohesion, chromatin remodeling, and long-range gene interactions. Mutations in NIPBL (cohesion regulator) are presented in approximately 60% of classical CdLS patients.\nOnly a few Chinese cases have been reported, regardless of the many CdLS cases reported worldwide. Herein, we presented a 2-day-old newborn who was suspected to be a CdLS patient. The pathogenic mutation was searched using whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq).\nThe girl was the first child of the first pregnancy of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents without any familiar diseases or genetic defects. The child’s birth length was 39 cm; birth weight was 1800 g; and head circumference was 30.5 cm. Physical examination revealed that she was smaller than gestational age with typical features of CdLS 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>, shown as excessive body hair, synophrys, hypertrichosis of the eyebrows, long eyelashes, broad depressed nasal bridge, down-turned angles of the mouth with thin lips, short neck, short limbs, hypertonicity, and high-arched palate.\nMoreover, both her fingers and toes were short, with one knuckle lacking in each finger. Furthermore, she was diagnosed with patent foramen ovale, hearing impairment, and feeding difficulty.\nPeripheral blood of the patient was collected for karyotype analysis and gene tests including CNV-seq and WES. The platforms of CNV-seq and WES were Illumina NextSeq CN 500 and Illumina Novaseq, respectively. In addition, peripheral blood was also collected from the parents for verification. Karyotype analysis revealed a normal female karyotype. CNV-seq test did not indicate any changes in gene copy number exceed 100 kb. Results of WES identified a missense heterozygous mutation in the exome 29 of NIPBL (RefSeq NM-133433), namely c.5567G>T. The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing; however, it was not found from the patient’s parents, indicating that it was a de novo mutation. Such mutation resulted in the replacement of Arg by Ile at codon 1856. The c.5567G>T mutation in NIPBL has never been reported in the gnomAD database, ExAC03 database, ShenZhou Genomic database or 1000G database previously. The NIPBL gene is the human homolog of the Drosophila Nipped-B gene which locates on chromosome 5p13. It encodes protein delangin, which is involved in chromatid cohesion processes and enhancer–promoter communications. NIPBL is required for cohesion loading on chromatin, a function that is conserved across evolution. In our case, the missense mutation occurs in the Armadillo-like helical functional domain, which is a highly conservative site similar to a previously reported mutation c.6272G>T.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Therefore, it is considered as the pathogenic gene mutation of the patient. In addition, this variant is predicted be \"damaging\" by PolyPhen and SIFT software, which further demonstrate the pathogenicity of the mutation. Our genetic diagnosis can not only help the patient to identify the disease but also has certain guiding significance for the parents in reproduction. Gillis et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> reported that the recurrence risk of a subsequent affected child from healthy parents with a previously affected offspring was estimated to be 1%. Thus, prenatal diagnosis is strongly recommended during the next pregnancy.\nThere is no clear indication that CdLS is ethnically diverse, but cases of CdLS in China are rarely reported, suggesting that many cases might have been missed. On the one hand, our pediatrician or genetic experts do not know this disease very well. On the other hand, patients are usually limited to detect the major five disease-causing genes due to technical constraints. However, other genes such as KMT2, SETD5, or chromosome deletions such as 9q31.1-q32 deletion and 8p23. 1deletion can also lead to CdLS phenotype. In this study, the WES, which relies on high throughput and comprehensive detection, has a great advantage in the diagnosis of single-gene disease. Besides, CNV-seq can detect chromosome deletions. Thus, the combination of these two methods might contribute to discovering all possible pathogenic gene mutations or deletions at one time, which might improve the detection rate and save time.\nGillis et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> showed significant differences between patients with and without NIPBL mutations by genotype-phenotype correlation study. They found that patients with NIPBL mutations had more severe phenotype for growth retardation and development delay compared with other gene mutations. The exact function of NIPLB is unknown; however, it is strongly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and thymus and is essential for the proper development in the growing embryo. Mannini et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> reviewed the mutation spectrum that occurred in the five genes underlying CdLS and found that the association between phenotypes caused by the mutations in five different genes were NIPBL, HDAC8, RAD21, SMC1A, and SMC3, from severe to mild. Among various mutation types of NIPBL, nonsense, splice site, and frameshift mutations that lead to a truncated and presumably nonfunctional NIPBL protein are associated with a more severe phenotype. Missense mutations, in general, are associated with a milder phenotype characterized by absent limb abnormalities and less severe developmental and growth involvement. However, this is not absolute. Missense mutations, involving the HEAT domain, in particular H2-H4 repeat, have been identified in probands with severe phenotype. In our case, though the patient was confirmed to be a carrier of missense mutation in NIPBL, but she had obvious intrauterine growth delay: low weight (1800 g), low height (39 cm), as well as low head circumference (30.5 cm) at birth. What’s more, her lower extremities and upper extremities were all short, and all fingers have only two knuckles, which could be ascribed the influence of environment and other genetic factors in the expressivity of CdLS. Thus, the relationship of genotype-phenotype is complicated, which needs further study.\nIn conclusion, a novel missense mutation has been identified in NIPBL by WES. To the best of our knowledge, this mutation site has not been reported previously, which will broaden the mutation spectrum and might provide new insights into the diagnosis of CdLS.\nThe authors certify that they have obtained patient consent form.

As a retrospective study, this study was exempt from obtaining the informed consent of patients.\nBetween January 27, 2000, and February 1, 2014, 2664 consecutive patients with ULMCA who underwent PCI were enrolled and retrospectively studied at two centers (General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region and Nanjing First Hospital). Of these patients, 602 consecutive patients were diagnosed with AMI and subsequently underwent emergency PCI, including primary PCI, PCI after thrombolysis for STEMI patients, and emergency PCI for NSTEMI patients. ULMCA was identified as being the culprit of the lesions by angiography. Of these patients, 372 patients were diagnosed with STEMI (STEMI group) and 230 patients were diagnosed with NSTEMI (NSTEMI group). STEMI was defined as chest pain persisting for over 30 min and ST-segment elevation of the avR lead with ST-segment depression of the anterior and lower wall leads on the electrocardiogram. NSTEMI without ST-segment elevation in the electrocardiogram was defined as ischemic symptoms and either an increase in the creatine kinase level, with an isoenzyme-MB level that was three times that of the upper limit of the normal level, or abnormal troponin levels 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. The patients were treated with aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 1 year after the PCI procedure. Prasugrel and ticagrelor were not available for use. Other cardiovascular medications were given as per their current guidelines. The left main coronary artery was considered to be unprotected if there were no patent coronary artery bypass grafts or the right coronary artery (RCA) to the left anterior descending artery or left circumflex artery. The procedural strategy (thrombus aspiration, balloon dilatation, stent selection, use of an intra-aortic balloon pump [IABP], and anticoagulation regimen) was left to the discretion of the operator.\nPCI procedural success was defined as mean lesion diameter stenosis <30% in 2 near-orthogonal projections with thrombolysis in MI (TIMI) flow grade of 3 after emergency procedures, as visually assessed by the physician. The primary endpoint was the composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs: cardiac death, MI, or target vessel revascularization [TVR]) in-hospital, at 1 month, and at 1 year. Additional endpoints included definite stent thrombosis according to the ARC criteria.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> Detailed procedural and event data were monitored at two centers by an independent contract research organization. All of the MACE and definite/probable stent thrombosis events were adjudicated by an independent clinical event committee.\nAll of the surviving patients with no clinical contraindications were scheduled for angiographic evaluation at a 9-month mean follow-up time. The clinical follow-up data were obtained from an outpatient clinic visit or by direct telephone contact. The follow-up period began at the moment of hospital discharge. The data of the follow-up were retrospectively collected in a dedicated database.\nContinuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and were compared with Student’s t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Categorical variables were presented as frequency (%) and were compared with the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. Survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Landmark analysis was performed with a landmark of 1 month among patients who were event free at this time. Multivariate analysis of the 1-year MACE in STEMI and NSTEMI patients was performed using Cox regression analysis. Performed with the STEMI and NSTEMI groups separately, the candidate variables entered into regression equation were described by previous reports about the procedure for patients with ULMCA lesions.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,14]</u> The variables were removed if they produced P> 0.10.

For the higher proportions of in-hospital and 1-month cardiac death in the STEMI patients, the total MACE of them at 1 month was significantly increased compared to that of the NSTEMI patients (22.0% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.020). Similarly, the proportions of 1-year cardiac death were significantly different between the two groups (7.0% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.020). After excluding in-hospital and 1-month cardiac death, the proportions of 1-year cardiac death and MACE were almost equal between the two groups (1-year cardiac death: 1.3% [5/372] vs. 1.3% [3/230], P= 0.967; and 1-year MACE: 5.4% [20/372] vs. 4.3% [10/230], P= 0.318).\nMedication and outcomes of in-hospital, 1-month, and 1-year follow-up between two groups\n删除重复语句：<u>Medication and outcomes of in-hospital, 1-month, and 1-year follow-up between two groups</u>\nSTEMI: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; NSTEMI: Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; DAPT: Dual antiplatelet therapy; MACE: Major adverse cardiac events; MI: Myocardial infarction; TVR: Target vessel revascularization; ST: Stent thrombosis .\nTo further subanalyze both the groups, the proportions of 1-year cardiac death in the patients with a postprocedure TIMI flow grade <3 were significantly higher than those of the patients with a TIMI flow grade of 3 (STEMI group: 51.7% [15/29] vs. 4.1% [14/343], P< 0.001; NSTEMI group: 33.3% [3/9] vs 13.6% [3/221], P= 0.001). The results are presented in Figure 2.\nFrom the Kaplan-Meier analysis, there were significantly different proportions in the cardiac mortality (P = 0.017) and MACE (P = 0.019) between the STEMI and NSTEMI patients for 1 year, but no difference in MI and TVR (P = 0.52 and P = 0.36, respectively). Obviously, the landmark analysis clearly showed that the patients in STEMI group were associated with higher risks of MACE (16.7% vs. 9.1%, P = 0.009) and cardiac death (5.4% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.011) compared with NSTEMI patients at 1 month. Meanwhile, in patients with LM, the landmark analysis for incidences of MACE and cardiac death was similar between the STEMI and NSTEMI (5.4% vs. 5.2%, P = 0.720 and 1.6% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.720, respectively) in the intervals of 1–12 months. However, patients who were diagnosed with STEMI or NSTEMI had no significant difference in reinfarction (4.3% vs. 3.5%, P = 0.62 and 0.3% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.43, respectively) and TVR (5.4% vs. 3.5%, P = 0.28 and 5.1% vs. 4.8%, P = 0.82, respectively) in the intervals of 0–30 days as well as 30 days to 1 year. These results are presented in Figure 3.\nThe independent predictors for the 1-year MACE showed by multivariate analysis were different between the two groups, except for the variable of LVEF <35% and postprocedure TIMI flow grade of 3. For the STEMI patients, the independent predictors for the 1-year MACE included the variable of Killip class ≥III and IABP support. However, for the NSTEMI patients, the independent predictors were previous MI, ULMCA distal bifurcation, and 2-stent for distal ULMCA lesions 通用删除1(英):<u>(all of the variables had P< 0.05 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>)</u>.\nMultivariable analysis showing independent predictors of the 1-year MACE for the two groups\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariable analysis showing independent predictors of the 1-year MACE for the two groups</u>\nHR: Hazard ratio; CI: Confidence interval; MACE: Major adverse cardiac events; STEMI: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; NSTEMI: Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; MI: Myocardial infarction; LVEF: Left ventricular ejection fraction; LM: Left main artery; PCI: Percutaneous coronary intervention; TIMI: Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction; IABP: Intra-aortic balloon pump.\nThe principal findings from this study are that the patients who underwent emergency PCI for ULMCA-STEMI still remained at a higher risk for in-hospital cardiac events than the NSTEMI patients. Moreover, this high-profile tendency was sustained over 1 month in the patients with ULMCA-STEMI. A successful PCI procedure and a culprit vessel with a TIMI flow grade of 3 might improve the 1-year outcomes in the STEMI and NSTEMI patients.\nIn previously published studies, NSTEMI patients with non-ULMCA lesions were more likely to have a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease risk factors than STEMI patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> Compared to the NSTEMI patients in this study, the patients with ULMCA-STEMI who underwent primary PCI had significantly lower clinical risk factors, such as lower proportions of female patients, hypertension, and previous MI and PCI (all P< 0.05). Being a current smoker was related to the STEMI patients, whereas the mean age tended to be older among the NSTEMI patients. Those findings were similar to the results of the CADILLAC trial and Opera registry.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16,17]</u> In addition, severe atherosclerotic changes, including distal bifurcation disease of the left main artery and chronic total occlusions in RCA, were more frequently observed in the NSTEMI patients than those in the patients with ULMCA-STEMI in this study. Meanwhile, 96 (25.8%) of 372 patients with ULMCA-STEMI in our study received thrombolytic therapy before the emergency PCI procedure. Similar to previous reports, patients with ULMCA-STEMI received more early invasive therapy and a shorter total ischemic time than that of the NSTEMI patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u> However, among the STEMI patients in this study, most of the patients had thrombus-occluded ULMCA lesions that were regarded as being in the infarct-related artery (TIMI flow grade of 0/1 flow in 66.9%), whereas in the NSTEMI patients, most of the ULMCA lesions were usually patent with a nonocclusive thrombus (TIMI grade flow of 2/3 in over 80%) at the baseline coronary angiography. There have been prominent and fatal changes in patients with ULMCA-STEMI after symptom onset. Consequently, the 1-year outcome in patients with ULMCA-STEMI was significantly worse than that of the NSTEMI patients in the study, especially regarding cardiac death at 1 year. This different result may be associated with the larger amount of damaged cardiac muscle in STEMI patients with ULMCA lesions after symptom onset. Therefore, there were significantly higher proportions of Killip class ≥III, cardiac arrest, and worse heart function in the patients with ULMCA-STEMI than those in the patients ULMCA-NSTEMI. The previous studies proved that the high mortality rate was caused by cardiogenic shock/pulmonary edema (amount to Killip class III or IV) and cardiac arrest. Cardiogenic shock or pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest are closely related to the extent and location of coronary lesions and are more common in patients with extensive coronary artery disease, ULMCA lesions, or a depressed LVEF.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12]</u>\nUpon further analysis for MACE, an obvious change was observed by our study and other registries.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,10,11,12,13,14]</u> For the patients with ULMCA-STEMI, a significantly high mortality rate was sustained in-hospital and at 1 month. However, the mortality rate tended to stabilize after 1 month, so excluding in-hospital and 1-month cardiac death, the proportions of the cardiac death and MACE were almost equal between the two groups by landmark analysis in this study (MACE: 5.4% vs. 5.2%, P= 0.72 and cardiac death: 1.6% vs. 1.3%, P= 0.72). On the other hand, to further subanalyze the cardiac death in both of the groups, the proportions of the 1-year cardiac death in the patients with a postprocedure TIMI flow grade <3 were significantly higher than those of patients with a TIMI flow grade of 3, particularly in the patients with ULMCA-STEMI (STEMI group: 51.7% vs. 4.1%, P< 0.001; NSTEMI group: 33.3% vs 13.6%, P= 0.001). Indirectly, a successful procedure might considerably reduce the MACE for patients with STEMI or NSTEMI.\nMultivariate analysis provided definite results in an attempt to identify the differences between the two groups and intended to find which factors have the most important effect on the in-hospital and 1-year MACE. For the STEMI patients with ULMCA lesion, the independent predictors were almost associated with the amount of the infarcted muscle tissue after infarction attack, such as Killip class ≥III and IABP support. In the past decades, almost all of the studies about patients with ULMCA lesions confirm that the high incidence or mortality rate is attributed to cardiogenic shock/pulmonary edema and low left ventricular ejection. Commonly, IABP support was more likely to be used for patients who presented with hemodynamic instability.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,6,10,14]</u> Therefore, in the study, the IABP support was the predictor for the 1-year MACE for patients with STEMI (P = 0.03). Among the NSTEMI patients, the more independent predictors were related to the baseline risk factors, such as previous MI and ULMCA distal bifurcation lesions. Distal bifurcation lesions of the ULCMA appear to be associated with an increased risk for adverse events, such as side branch occlusion or restenosis. Obviously, low left ventricular ejection (LVEF <35%) was contributed to the high MACE for STEMI as well as NSTEMI patients. However, the successful revascularization (post-PCI TIMI flow grade of 3), which was an independent predictor for the two groups in this study, can decrease the rate of adverse events for patients with ULMCA and acute MI after emergency PCI. Likewise, the independent predictor of a post-PCI TIMI flow grade of 3 was more influential on the outcomes of patients with ULMCA-STEMI (STEMI: HR: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01–0.04, P= 0.018; NSTEMI: HR: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01–0.06, P< 0.001). The previous studies confirmed that a TIMI flow grade of 3 resulted in a 5-fold decrease in the annual mortality of these patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u>\nThis was a retrospective nonrandomized study with a relatively small sample size and only the results of 1-year follow-up. Like all observational studies, the present study is prone to biases from its nonrandom assignment of exposures. The time span of the 602 patients who were analyzed in this article is almost 13 years. However, the PCI procedures of these 602 patients are different but had the same changes for the two groups in the corresponding period, thus having little effect on the result analysis. Follow-up angiography was not performed in all of the patients. Therefore, the true restenosis rate is unknown. We report a lower mortality rate, which is difficult to use to make meaningful comparisons with other studies because the observation index in the study is Killip class ≥III (included cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema). Furthermore, some patients with ULMCA and AMI suffered cardiac death before admission and were not included in this study. Among the STEMI patients in this study, 96 (25.8%) of 372 patients received thrombolytic therapy before the PCI procedure. There was an important reason to explain the lower mortality rate in the present study because of the 33% patients with a pre-PCI TIMI flow grade 2/3 in the STEMI group. Despite these, the study of consecutive unselected patients from two experienced centers provides insight into emergency PCI for this high-risk group of patients.\nIn conclusion, emergency PCI appears to be technically feasible and a reasonable alternative to surgical revascularization for AMI patients with ULMCA disease. In our results, many differences in the characteristics of the patients with STEMI and NSTEMI distinctly affected the outcomes. The patients with ULMCA-STEMI still remained at a much higher risk for adverse events compared with the NSTEMI patients. If a successful PCI procedure was performed, the 1-year outcomes in those patients with acute MI and ULMCA lesions might improve. Ultimately, randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the optimal treatment strategy.\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Construction Program of National Clinical Priority Specialty.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

This comprised placement of 2 medial anchors with horizontal mattress sutures at an angle of .≤45° into the medial margin of the infraspinatus footprint, just lateral to the articular surface, and 2 lateral anchors with horizontal mattress sutures. Standardized, 50% partial, articular-sided infraspinatus lesions were created in the contralateral shoulder. The infraspinatus tendon from the contralateral shoulder was repaired using two anchors with transtendon single-row mattress sutures. Each specimen underwent cyclic loading from 10 to 100 N for 50 cycles, followed by tensile testing to failure. Gap formation and strain over the footprint area were measured using a motion capture system; stiffness and failure load were determined from testing data.Results Gap formation for the transtendon single-row repair was significantly smaller (P ＜0.05) when compared with the double-row repair for the first cycle ((1.74±0.38) mm vs. (2.86±0.46) mm, respectively) and the last cycle ((3.77±0.45) mm vs. (5.89±0.61) mm, respectively).

Inhibition of ROCK has been proposed as a treatment for PAH. But the mechanism of RhoA/ROCK pathway and its downstream signaling in proliferation of human PASMCs is unclear. We investigated the effect of fasudil, a selective ROCK inhibitor, on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induced human PASMC proliferation, and the possible association between RhoA/ROCK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),p27KiP1.Methods Human PASMCs were cultured with the stimulation of 10 ng/ml PDGF, and different concentrations of fasudil were added before the addition of mitogen. Cell viability and cell cycle were determined with MTT and flow cytometry respectively. ROCK activity, ERK activity and protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear angigen (PCNA) and p27Kip1 were measured by immunoblotting.Results By MTT assay, PDGF significantly increased the OD value that represented human PASMC proliferation, and pretreatment with fasudil significantly reversed this effect in a dose-dependent manner. After PDGF stimulation, the percentage of cells in S phase increased dramatically from 15.6％ to 24.3％, while the percentage in G0/G1 phase was reduced from 80.6％ to 59％. And pretreatment with fasudil reversed the cell cycle effect of PDGF significantly in a dose-dependent manner.

Over the past 50 years,AF incidence has increased by roughly 350.0%.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> In a review from the Global Burden of Disease study, it was estimated that the worldwide prevalence ofAF is 596.2 or 373.1/100,000 men or women. The Incidence ofAF significantly increased with age.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Approximately 1% of AF patients are <60 years old, up to 12% of AF patients are in the 75–84 years age range and the AF prevalence is even higher in patients that are 80 years or older. Dementia is a disabling disease of the brain that characterized by impairments in memory and other cognitive functions. It can seriously affect human life. Worldwide, an estimated 33 million elderly individuals suffer from dementia, and this number is expected to reach 81.1 million by 2040. It is obvious that cognitive function deteriorates naturally with the aging of the body, butAF could accelerate the pace. According to some systematic reviews and meta-analysis, AF can increase the risk of dementia by 40%. For the elder individuals, who are more than 75 years old, their dementia usually resulting from cerebrovascular lesions and neurodegeneration. While for the middle age individuals who are 40–59 years old, the advent of dementia is derived from cardiovascular disease. AF increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality. However,AF may also increase the risk of dementia, given the mutual vascular risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, advancing age, chronic kidney disease, vascular disease, heart failure, inactivity/low activity, genetics, sleep apnea, and alcohol consumption.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u> The term \"cardiogenic dementia\" was first introduced more than 40 years ago to support a possible link between AF and cognitive impairment. It was not until recently that demonstratedAF is an independent risk factor of cognitive impairment and may increase the risk of dementia through several mechanisms, including cerebral hypoperfusion, thromboembolism (including both stroke and subclinical cerebral infarcts), inflammation, anticoagulation cerebral micro-bleeds, and neuronal function impairment. Therefore, strategies that control the development of AF and promote cardiovascular health may help delay the onset of dementia. TraditionalAF treatment involves anticoagulation, rhythm, and rate control. Thus, by understanding the potential relationship between AF and dementia, novel approaches may be proposed for future AF management.\nOne of the most severe complications ofAF is embolic strokes, which increases the risk of stroke 5 folds. Evidence supporting the association between AF and dementia in patients with stroke stems from both pathological and clinical studies. A history of strokes considerably increases the risk of dementia, with prevalence rates ranging from 13% to 32% from 3 months to 1 year after stroke. Moreover, incidence rates of new-onset dementia after stroke range from 24% within 3 years to 33% within 5 years. The size, severity, and the location of the stroke also affect the onset and severity of dementia. Apart from stroke, silent cerebral infarction is another potential link between AF and dementia. These infarctions tend to be small and are located deep in the white matter, which therefore often remains clinically unnoticed and can only be found through brain magnetic resonance. In a previous study that focused on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it was noted that roughly one-fourth of patients with AF suffered from silent cerebral infarctions. Moreover, previous studies demonstrated that anticoagulation therapy was effective in both stroke patients and silent cerebral infarction patients. Anticoagulant therapy can effectively inhibit the form of clot.\nBunch et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> recently investigated the medical records of 10,537 patients who were on warfarin therapy (target international normalized ration, INR 2–3) within the Intermountain Healthcare system. The incident rates of dementia were roughly 2-fold higher in subjects with the poorest anticoagulation maintenance compared to patients with the highest anticoagulation time in a therapeutic range. Moreover, improved anticoagulation control was particularly effective in patients who already showed some cognitive impairment. In a recent study, the risk of dementia was compared between AF patients using warfarin or non-Vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). A lower risk of dementia was found among patients who received NOAC when compared to warfarin users.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> In most individuals with AF, current guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention, and the decrease in stroke risk will consequently lead to a reduced risk of adverse cognitive outcomes. However, it is not known whether anticoagulation always reduces the occurrence of dementia in AF patients? One study showed that long-term warfarin use decreased cognitive function through chronic cerebral injury from micro-bleeds, and increased the risk for major bleeds. The degree was dependent on the time spent in the therapeutic range (TTR).通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Jacobs et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> evaluated 992 warfarin-treated AF patients and showed that in more than 25% of cases, patients with an INR >3 were 2.40 folds more likely to develop dementia. Both microbleeds and microischemic events, though often subclinical, have been associated with a decrease in cognitive functioning. When patients with AF are put on anticoagulation therapy, the INR ratio should be monitored. According to the guidelines, the optimal range of warfarin was an INR of 2.0–3.0, and to achieve the best safety and efficacy endpoints, the average individual time in TTR should be >65%.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> To reduce AF-associated dementia, we should not only focused on INR but on TTR. SAMe-TT2R2 (sex female, age <60 years, medical history more than 2 comorbidities, treatment [interacting medications, e.g. amiodarone], tobacco used [doubled], race [doubled]) is a recently developed rating scale for the prediction of patients who would do well on vitamin K antagonist with a high TTR of >70% (SAMe-TT2R2 score 0–1) and those who would do less well (SAMe-TT2R2 score ≥2). For individuals who received a high SAMe-TT2R2 score, NOACs may be a better treatment option. The RE-LY trial showed that for dabigatran at dose of 110 mg twice daily, the efficacy was generally similar to that of warfarin, expect that for dabigatran, the risk of hemorrhagic stroke was lower. Dabigatran at a dose of 110 mg twice daily was safer than warfarin when risk of major bleeding was considered. The ROCKET AF trial showed that, when using rivaroxaban, the risk of hemorrhagic stroke was significantly lower compared to warfarin. In theory, reducing stroke can reduce dementia; however, studies that focused on the cognitive function of novel oral anticoagulant drugs on AF patients are limited. Brooy et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> reported a case of an 89-year-old male skydiver with AF, who developed mild cognitive impairment shortly after commencing dabigatran. This medication was terminated and warfarin was used as an alternative anticoagulant. Marked cognitive and physical improvement was shown within 2 weeks of dabigatran cessation. Moreover, within 2 months, this patient returned to complete physical independence. Although the pathogenesis of this case is unclear, further evaluation of the role of thrombin in the brain is warranted.\nPrevious studies showed that, compared to man, women with AF had a higher relative risk of developing cerebrovascular events. This may be because antithrombotic drugs are more often prescribed to men since men are usually affected by several cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, antithrombotic therapy may be an effective treatment to reduce the incidence of stroke and slow down the process of dementia. However, in a Japanese trial, reduced risk of stroke was not observed when patients were using aspirin; however, the risk of bleeding was increased. In a recent Hong Kong cohort, aspirin showed a nonsignificant 18.7% reduction in ischemic strokes, compared with no therapy. Jacobs et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> demonstrated that in AF patients who were given antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies, the time exposed to overanticoagulation increased dementia risk. Thus, whether receiving antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies is effective in the prevention of dementia is unclear.\nIn previous studies, biologically plausible mechanisms for the association between statin use and decreased stroke severity have been evaluated. Prestroke statin use increased collateral blood flow and reduced infarct size. Furthermore, statins can exert antithrombotic effects by inhibiting the coagulation pathway and platelet activation. Moreover, it was demonstrated a beneficial effect of baseline statins on the outcome of patients who had a stroke. The JUPITER trial demonstrated a significant reduction in venous thromboembolism with rosuvastatin. Statins may have beneficial effects in AF-related stroke. Ko et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> demonstrated that prestroke statin use among individuals who presented with ischemic stroke in AF associated with a 32% reduction in stroke risk. To reduce the risk of stroke among patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, current guidelines strongly recommend statin therapy to intensively lower lipid levels.\nThe renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in pathological mechanisms of target organ damage as well as the induction of hypertension. Thus, in addition to its antihypertensive effects, the RAS has been expected to prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. ACEI/ARBs are effective in the secondary prevention of AF, which has been proven in many large clinical trials. Furthermore, recent large clinical trials such as the LIFE study and the MOSES study indicated that blockade helped prevent first and recurrent strokes independently of its blood pressure-lowering effects. The Acute Candesartan Cilexetil Therapy in Stroke Survivors study showed that in the acute phase of stroke, RAS inhibition can lead to brain protection irrespective of its hypotensive effect. Brain RAS is involved in ischemic brain damage after stroke. Moreover, the activation of the human RAS exaggerates ischemic brain damage through stimulation of the angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor, whereas activation of the AT2 receptor attenuated brain injury. Recent studies have raised the possibility that stimulation of AT2 receptors may promote cell differentiation and regeneration of neuronal tissue. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) therapy is not only beneficial to prevent AF but is also beneficial to prevent dementia. Therefore, patients with a high risk of AF (heart failure and hypertension) as well as those who already suffered from AF are recommended to receive RAAS therapy.\nDuring the past decade, catheter ablation ofAF has rapidly developed from an experimental unproven approach to a common ablation procedure that is used around the globe. In recent years, several randomized trials have shown that in the prevention of recurrent and symptomatic AF, catheter ablation was superior to antiarrhythmic therapy. Since AF is an independent risk factor for dementia, catheter ablation should have beneficial effects in patients with dementia. AF patients treated with catheter ablation had significantly reduced rates of death, dementia, and stroke. However, catheter ablation can lead to the formation of microembolic. Herm et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> used MRI to demonstrate several brain lesions in patients who underwent atrial catheter ablation for symptomatic AF. According to Herm, these brain lesions persisted to some extent but did not cause cognitive impairment. Kochhäuser et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> suggested that no clinical overt cognitive deficit existed and no significant difference was found in cognitive function related to the ablation approach used. However, the number of microembolic signals correlated with a subtle, diffuse postprocedural impairment of neuropsychological function. Therefore, catheter ablation reduced the progression of dementia in AF patients, and the need to reduce microemboli during ablation is significant.\nThe association between AF and stroke is clear; however, some evidence indicates a link between AF and dementia that is independent of stroke. The following paragraphs include treatments targeting this mechanism.\nAF, as shown to reduce cardiac output and this reduction, is greater at fast ventricular rates. The reduced cardiac output may lead to cerebral hypoperfusion, which may involve one of the mechanisms of AF patients to attain dementia. Especially in the elderly whose cerebral perfusion is already diminished, further cerebral blood flow reductions from heart-brain vascular related risk factors may lead to a \"neuronal energy crisis\" through reducedATP synthesis, and lowered ATP production will trigger a series of metabolic events including hippocampal-glial activation, oxidative stress, aberrant protein synthesis, ionic membrane pump dysfunction, signal transduction impairment, and neurotransmitter failure. These events form the basis of neurodegenerative changes. Early rhythm control attenuates the risk of developing dementia. Cacciatore et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> evaluated the role of ventricular rate response on the incidence of dementia in elderly individuals with cognitive impairment and AF, and demonstrated that a low/high ventricular rate (<50/>90 beats per minutes [bpm]) is predictive of dementia in the presence but not in the absence of AF. Moreover, Efimova et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> found a direct correlation between blood pressure and cognitive function. AF patients and rapid ventricular rates refractory to medical treatment have marked signs of brain hypoperfusion and impaired cognitive function. In the AFFIRM study, in which two groups have a similar heart rate, it was shown that disabling anoxic encephalopathy was similar between two groups.\nPreviously, adequate ventricular rate control was empirically defined as <80 bpm at rest. However, as the AFFIRM trial showed, strict rate-control therapy may result in symptomatic bradycardia in 7.3% of patients. Furthermore, the RACE study showed that a higher resting heart rates was not associated with adverse outcomes. Therefore, the guide recommended that a resting heart rate of <100 bpm should be the initial approach in AF patients. For individuals whose symptoms persisted or in which tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy occurred, a resting heart rate of <80 bpm was reasonable.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> It remains unclear if this treatment is beneficial to slow down the process of dementia in AF patients.\nStatin and RAAS therapy are important types of anti-inflammatory therapy. In our previous study, we focused on the association between cognitive impairment in stroke reduction. Recent studies have shown that in addition to reducing stroke, anti-inflammatory activities can delay the onset of dementia in AF patients via several mechanisms. AF increases highly sensitive C-reactive protein in a linear and independent manner in patients without and with coexistent cardiovascular diseases. AF is a pro-inflammatory condition that may be associated with the development of dementia. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers in both AF and dementia suggested a role of inflammatory pathways in the mediation of both diseases. The inflammatory mediators may accentuate vasculopathy and neuronal degeneration, thereby increasing the risk of dementia. Lappegard et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> examined older patients with AF who underwent anti-inflammatory therapy and demonstrated that intensive lipid-lowering treatment can modify the deterioration of neurocognitive function and the loss of volume in certain cerebral areas. Chao et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> found that compared with AF patients who were not treated with statins, statin users had a lower risk of nonvascular dementia. In a study in which over 4000 patients were enrolled, the association between inflammatory markers (CC-reactive protein and interleukin-6) and cognitive decline was modest but was much stronger in those with inherited risk. There is also evidence suggests that statins and extremely low cholesterol levels may increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage after thrombolysis. Thus, additional studies are required to investigate that early targeted treatment of inflammation affects AF development, dementia, or a combination of both.\nIn conclusion, previous studies have shown that AF is associated with a higher risk of dementia. In this report, we discussed various treatments to reduce dementia in AF patients. These novel findings may be beneficial to thousands of patients and their families who already suffer from the devastating effects of AF and to all who have a higher probability to get demented, even if clinical symptoms of this dramatic pathology have not been observed.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81570220)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}
{"seq_id": "2739532b-b4b2-40b7-b1c1-bb5c52136825", "title": "", "text": "【0】About 20% of congenital heart disease (CHD) require surgical repair of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in initial operations.1 Many of these CHDs are cyanotic CHDs, including tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), pulmonary atresia with or without ventricular septal defect (VSD), truncus arteriosus, transposition of the arteries (TGA) with VSD and pulmonary stenosis after Rastelli operation, double outlet right ventricle (DORV), and other complex CHD. Patients with aortic stenosis after the Ross procedure also involve pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in the procedure.\nAmong these lesions, TOF is the commonest cyanotic heart disease where surgical repair and relief of the RVOT obstruction with patch enlargement will uniformly leave the patient with residual RVOT dysfunction with varying degrees of pulmonary stenosis and/or pulmonary regurgitation, leading to deleterious effects on the right ventricle (RV) over the long term. The chronic effects of pressure and volume loading on the RV ultimately lead to RVOT dysfunction, causing RV dilation, RV failure, and arrhythmias. Clinically, the patient may become symptomatic with exercise intolerance, right ventricular failure, and arrhythmias, and may even develop life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death.\nIn the long term, patients with TOF will eventually need pulmonary valve replacement (PVR). In other congenital heart defects, which are mainly conotruncal defects, such as truncus arteriosus, TGA with VSD and pulmonary stenosis, and DORV with VSD and pulmonary stenosis, the RVOT is often repaired with the placement of RV to pulmonary artery (PA) conduits which may be homografts, bioprosthetic valves or non-valved conduits. Bioprosthetic valves may be made from porcine or bovine materials, for example, Contegra, Hancock, Sorin, and Freestyle valves. Non-valved conduits may be a Goretex conduit. Irrespective of the valve type or materials that they are made from, all these RV to PA conduits are subjected to degenerations and deterioration in function over time and need PVR as in the case of TOF.\nConventionally, surgical PVR is utilized for the relief of RVOT dysfunction. Satisfactory results in the long term have been achieved. Many patients manage to survive to adulthood. However, multiple surgical reintervention to replace these valves throughout life are inevitable and surgical risks will increase with each additional operation.\nThe drawbacks of the need for repeated surgical reintervention have stimulated a search for alternative methods for PVR, the transcatheter technique of PVR. In 2000, Bonhoeffer et al.2 implanted the first transcatheter pulmonary valve into a human. This led to the development of Melody transcatheter pulmonary valve (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN, US). Acute success in the first clinical case was reported in 2000.2 The Melody valve got the Conformite Europeene (CE) marking in Europe in 2006 and was approved for clinical use by Health Canada in the same year. It received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Humanitarian Device Exemption approval for commercial use in dysfunctional RV to pulmonary conduits in the United States in 2010.\nAnother valve, the Edwards Sapien valve was first implanted in dysfunctional RV-PA conduits in 20083 and this valve can be used for patients with greater RVOT diameter. Subsequent studies allowed for approval of the Sapien XT valve (Edwards Life Sciences LLC, Irvine, California) in transcatheter PVR (TPVR) in failed RV-PA conduits.4 In this article, the indications for TPVR, the pre-procedural considerations, the techniques, outcomes as well as the latest developments in the application of TPVR for native and larger RVOT will be reviewed and discussed.\nThe indications of TPVR are basically similar to that of surgical patients. Most will agree on PVR in symptomatic patients in the TOF group with moderate to severe pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary regurgitation. The issue of asymptomatic patients is more controversial. Indeed, the deleterious effects of progressive RV dilation, RV dysfunction, failure, development of ventricular arrhythmias, and mortality are well known. However, in an asymptomatic patient, the challenge is to define the threshold of RV dilation at which intervention will allow a good chance of reversal of structural and functional abnormalities. Different cardiology societies in different countries may adopt slightly different criteria for TPVR in asymptomatic patients.\nThe summary of the currently adopted criteria recommended by different countries for TPVR is listed in Table 1.5,6,7,8 Since TPVR is less invasive than surgical PVR, it is likely that more asymptomatic patients may benefit from the procedure. Contraindications for TPVR include lack of venous access from both femoral and jugular route, severe pulmonary stenosis that cannot be relieved by balloon dilatation, active endocarditis or other systemic infection, known allergy to aspirin or heparin, and pregnancy.\nSummary of criteria for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement\n删除重复语句：<u>Summary of criteria for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement</u>\nAbbreviations: ACC, American College of Cardiology; AHA, American Heart Association; AR, aortic regurgitation; LV, left ventricle; LVED, left ventricular end-diastolic; RV, right ventricle; RVED, right ventricular end-diastolic; RVEF, right ventricular ejection fraction; RVES, right ventricular end-systolic; TR, tricuspid regurgitation; VSD, ventricular septal defect.\nA good history of symptoms, physical examination, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram are needed. Multiple imaging modalities, including echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and computerized tomography are required for defining the morphology of the RVOT, the presence of significant pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary regurgitation, the bioprosthetic valve status, as well as associated residual cardiac lesions like branch PA stenosis, residual VSD, tricuspid, and aortic regurgitation. Coronary artery anomalies and their relative positions and courses which might be compressed after TPVR have to be noted. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions with all relevant measurements of the RVOT as well as 3D printing of the RVOT are useful for planning the procedure. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing should be performed to assess the functional capacity of patients.\nMultidisciplinary discussion among different specialties, including pediatric cardiologists, adult congenital heart cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and cardiac anesthesia is necessary to determine the best strategy for each individual patient. Vascular access has to be considered in the planning as well.\nGeneral anesthesia is usually needed with biplane fluoroscopy to understand the RVOT and PA anatomy. The femoral venous route is often the first choice; the jugular, ideally on the right, can also be used if the former is not available.\nBecause the Melody valve is the first valve used in TPVR for humans, the following descriptions will be more relevant to its implantation. The basic principles actually also apply to other valves that are used at later times, with some modifications of techniques in the procedures.\nA baseline right and left heart catheterization and hemodynamic assessment are performed together with RVOT, PA, aortic, and coronary angiography. From these data, a plan is worked out for the final balloon sizing, the risk of conduit rupture and coronary artery compression as well as the preparation of the conduit like pre-stenting before implantation of the pulmonary valve. Concurrent PA stenosis may have to be dealt with before the procedure.\nPrior to stenting of the conduit, assessment for risk of coronary artery obstruction is necessary. A variety of coronary artery anomalies can be at risk, including left anterior descending from the right coronary artery, ostial stenosis, and abnormal location secondary to the previous reimplantation. Coronary artery testing is performed with either aortic root angiography and/or selective coronary angiography while a balloon with the intended valve diameter is inflated in the RVOT. Compromise of coronary artery flow is a contraindication for stenting the existing conduit or TPVR. Aortic root distortion leading to aortic regurgitation is a less common problem but has been reported.删除4：<u>9</u>\nSignificant conduit stenosis and/or calcifications often exist in dysfunctional RVOT. Conduit stenosis has to be relieved by balloon dilation and/or pre-stenting to provide a suitable landing zone for the valve and to achieve an acceptable post-procedural RV pressure. Serial balloon dilation with high-pressure angioplasty catheters may be needed. This places the conduit at risk of rupture, necessitating a covered stent angioplasty with a Cheatham-platinum covered stent (NuMED, Hopkinton, NY, US).10 Additional bare metal stents may be implanted to secure an adequate final desired diameter and to avoid stent fracture, recoil and limit metal fatigue . Multiple stents may be necessary to prevent stent fracture of the Melody valve.\nThe Melody valve is hand crimped onto the balloon Ensemble system (Medtronic). Balloon ranges from 18-22 mm and up to 24 mm with the maintenance of valve competency. The outer diameter of the valve is 2 mm larger than the balloon diameter.\nThe Edwards XT valve is crimped onto the Novaflex delivery system using the proprietary process. This system is stiff and manipulation may be difficult. The use of the Sapien S3 with a smaller delivery system is more amenable to traversing the RVOT.\nThe delivery system is then advanced to the appropriate position and the valve is implanted by balloon dilation .\nFollowing the implant, post-implant hemodynamic data are obtained. An angiogram is performed to evaluate for valve competence and perivalvular leak.\nImplanting a Melody valve in a bioprosthetic valve tends to be a less complex procedure because the metal frame in it cannot be over-expanded at low pressure to compress the coronary arteries. Pre-stenting may not be necessary unless there is valve stenosis. On the other hand, this kind of valve-in-valve therapy may further decrease the internal diameter of the bioprosthetic valve which is limited by the rigid metal frame, especially in those with smaller bioprosthetic valves to start with, thus leading to functional stenosis. Historically surgical PVR was the treatment option if the internal diameter of the valve-in-valve was considered too small for the patient. However, intentional fracture with a high-pressure balloon of the bioprosthetic valve frame as a means of facilitating further expansion of the valve in the aortic, pulmonary, and tricuspid position has been reported. In the pulmonary position, it was demonstrated that fracture can be safely performed prior to valve implantation, thus, achieving a larger internal diameter and better hemodynamic result in valve-in-valve therapy. This procedure obviates the need for a surgical operation to match the patient’s size.11 In this situation, coronary artery anatomy and risks of compression must be considered as described in the aforementioned section.\nThe Melody valve (Medtronic Inc.) is a bovine jugular venous valve mounted on a platinum iridium-covered stent. Two sizes of the valve, 16 and 18 mm venous segments are sutured to 20 and 22 mm covered stents, respectively and each of them can be expanded 4 mm up to 20 and 22 mm, respectively . The valve is delivered via the Medtronic Ensemble delivery system which utilizes a \"balloon-in-balloon\" (NuMED Inc, Hopkinton, NY, US) available in 18, 20, and 22 mm sizes. The delivery system is 22 Fr. \nExperience from European centers in UK,5 France,12 Germany,13 and Italy,14 on the Melody valve predates use in the US. Early reports showed a procedural success rate of 90%-98%5,12,13,14 with excellent short-term results achieving good relief of pulmonary stenosis and significant reduction or complete elimination of pulmonary regurgitation.\nMid-term results on the use of the Melody valve alone showed an excellent success rate of 96.7%, a freedom from reoperation rate of 70% after 70 months. Further lowering of reoperation rates with increasing experience with the valve system has been reported.15 The US Investigational Device Exemption trial reported its medium to long-term results in 2015 on a total of 171 patients with 148 (86.5%) successful implants and a reoperation-free rate of 76% at 5 years.16 The Melody valve received CE mark approval in 2006 and FDA granted Humanitarian Device Exemption approval in 2010 and full post-market approval in 2015. Subsequent US post-market approval study showed a 98% success rate.删除4：<u>17</u>\nLong-term results are now available for the Melody valve because it has the longest history of use for all types of RVOT conduits. Long-term outcomes after Melody TPVR in the US Investigational Device Exemption showed that 10 years after implantation, freedom from mortality is 90% with endocarditis being the most important cause of related death while 56% of deaths are unrelated to TPVR. This survival is comparable to that of surgical series. Freedom from reoperation is 79% while that for any intervention is 60%. Freedom from TPVR-related endocarditis is 81%, with annualized endocarditis rate of 2%. Freedom from TPV dysfunction is 53% of which 71% have only no or trace pulmonary valve regurgitation, 26% have mild regurgitation and 3% have moderate PR. 78% of patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I and 22% in NYHA class II. Therefore, this long-term study affirms the benefits of Melody TPVR in the lifetime management of patients with RVOT conduits of any type by providing sustained symptomatic and hemodynamic improvements in the majority of patients.删除4：<u>18</u>\nThe Edwards Sapien XT (Edwards Life Sciences) transcatheter heart valve (THV) was approved by the FDA for use in the pulmonary position in 2016. The valve is made of bovine pericardial tissue and mounted on a cobaltchromium stent with a fabric skirt on the outside lower part of the stent to minimize perivalvular regurgitation. The valve sizes are 23, 26, and 29 mm, and they are delivered via the Edward Novaflex delivery system.\nThe Sapien 3 valve expands the valve sizes with a 20 mm option with the Commander valve delivery system which allows better delivery into the RVOT. Data from a series of 56 patients from Germany suggested excellent procedural success and no reinterventions were needed up to two years of follow-up.删除4：<u>19</u>\nThe COMPASSION multicenter clinical trial enrolled 81 patients and implanted the Sapien XT THV in 69 with a 93.7% freedom from reintervention at 3 years.4 There are ongoing clinical trials for post-market approval surveillance on the use of this valve.\nAnother multicenter large cohort study on the Sapien XT and Sapien S3 valves on 774 patients showed that technical success was achieved in 97.4% of patients. Serious adverse events were reported in 10% of patients. Fourteen patients underwent urgent surgery and nine patients had a second valve implanted. Tricuspid valve injury occurred in 1.7% of patients and 1.3% of patients had new moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation. In total, therefore, about 3% of patients had tricuspid valve complications. The function of the implanted valves at discharge was excellent for the most patient but 8.5% had moderate or greater pulmonary regurgitation or maximum Doppler pressure gradient >40 mmHg. During follow-up from 5 to 24 months (median 12 months), nine patients had endocarditis and another 17 additional patients require reintervention either by surgical valve replacement or valve-in-valve TPVR. Medium-term results of the Sapien valves are generally good but long-term data are needed.删除4：<u>20</u>\nLong-term results on reintervention and survival after TPVR using both Melody valves (82.3%) and all Sapien valves (XT, S3, and Sapien) (17.7%) on all RVOT conduit types in the largest multicenter cohort of 2476 patients followed for 8475 patient-years are available at the time of writing up this article. There were 95/2476 (3.8%) deaths mostly caused by heart failure. The cumulative incidence of death at 8 years post-TPVR is 8.9%. Risk factors for death are age at TPVR (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.04/year), prosthetic valve in other positions like aorta, mitral and tricuspid valves (HR 2:1), and existing transvenous pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. There were 258/2476 (10.4%) TPVR reintervention. The cumulative incidence of TPVR reintervention is 25.1% at 8 years post-TPVR while that for surgical reintervention is 14.4%. The risk factors for surgical reintervention are age, prior endocarditis, TPVR into a stented bioprosthetic valve, and post-implant gradient. These long-term results showed that survival and freedom from reintervention after TPVR are comparable to outcomes of surgical conduit/valve replacement across a wide age range.删除4：<u>21</u>\nUsing the same cohort of patients, it was found that 184/2476 (7.35%) patients developed endocarditis with a median of 2.7 years after TPVR. Cumulative incidence is 9.5% at 5 years and 16.9% at 8 years post-implant, and annualized incidence is 2.2 per 100 patient-years. A large proportion of bacteria identified were Staphylococcus aureus and the viridans group of streptococcus. Risk factors were young age, previous history of endocarditis, and high residual gradient. Management strategy is either valve explant or RVOT reintervention. Endocarditis mortality was 12/2476 (6.6%). All patients’ deaths were due to S. aureus. Severe endocarditis occurred in 44% of patients.22 From these long-term results, endocarditis is certainly a serious adverse outcome after TPVR that needs vigilant surveillance despite the fact that TPVR remains an important tool in the management of RVOT dysfunction.\nIn summary, the long-term outcome of TPVR on conduit at RVOT is excellent. Reasons for reintervention, be it surgical or transcatheter TPVR are usually due to dysfunction of the implanted valve, endocarditis, and stent fractures. The problem of stent fractures should become less by implanting multiple stents to enhance the landing zone for the valve. Coronary artery compression, though a dreadful complication of TPVR in the early years, should also be mostly avoided by vigilant testing before the procedure.\nAfter transannular patch repair for TOF, the native RVOT tend to expand to larger diameters with time, lacks a tubular landing zone, and can assume variable shapes and morphology. These anatomical characteristics pose more difficulties for TPVR and make it more challenging. Only a small proportion of these RVOTs, about 15%, has anatomy suitable for off-label use of the smaller Melody valve or Sapien valves. There is a need to develop larger valves to cater to the native RVOTs.\nTo circumvent this difficulty, alternative methods have been sought. First, the Alterra Adaptive Pre-stent, a self-expanding partially covered stent (Edwards Life Sciences LLC), was designed to internally remodel a wide variety of RVOT morphologies, thereby creating a suitable landing zone for implantation of a standard balloon-expandable THV, thus enabling TPVR to be used to treat a broader range of patients. The first successful human implant of this device with subsequent implantation of a 29 mm Sapien 3 was reported in 2018.23 This is still undergoing clinical trials. Secondly, valves implanted into one or both of the proximal branch pulmonary arteries24 has been shown to be effective in reducing the degree of pulmonary regurgitation but this does not render a competent RVOT which should be the ultimate goal of the intervention.\nLarger RVOT valves suitable for transcatheter implantation into native RVOT are actively sought and undergone clinical trials in the past decade. These included the Medtronic Harmony valve,25 the Venus P valve (Venus Med tech, Hangzhou, China),26,27 the Pulsta valve (TaeWoong Medical Co, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea)28 and the Med-Zenith PT valve (Beijing Med-Zenith, Beijing, China).29,30 These newer and larger pulmonary valves are described and discussed in the following section.\nThe Harmony valve (Medtronic Inc.) is made of porcine pericardium mounted on a covered nickel-titanium (nitinol) self-expanding stent with flaring at both proximal and distal ends  and is delivered by a 25 Fr delivery system. Two sizes, 22 and 25 mm valve diameters are available. This is the first valve that is developed to cater to native RVOTs with larger diameters.\nCurrently available transcatheter pulmonary valves for native / patched right ventricular outflow tract\n删除重复语句：<u>Currently available transcatheter pulmonary valves for native / patched right ventricular outflow tract</u>\nAbbreviation: FDA, Food and Drug Administration.\nClinical trials on its use started from 2013 to 2015. Acute and short-term outcomes were favorable and demonstrated a high procedural success rate, safety, and good device performance.删除4：<u>25</u>\nThe FDA trial results from a prospective, non-randomized multicentre clinical study on 66 patients with follow-up to 5 years demonstrated no procedure or device-related death within 30 days of implant and 89.2% freedom from surgical or reintervention procedures related to the device as well as acceptable valve function at 6 months.25 Adverse events included irregular or abnormal heart rhythm in 23.9% (14.1% ventricular tachycardia), leakage around the valve in 8.5% (1.4% major leak), minor bleeding in 7.0%, narrowing of PV in 4.2% and movement of the implant in 4.2%. Contraindications for implantation of the Harmony valve are infection in the heart or elsewhere, patient intolerance to anti-platelet agents or anti-coagulants, and sensitivity to nitinol.\nFDA approval for its full use in native RVOT has been obtained in 2022. The FDA statement states that compared with surgery, it is a less invasive and effective treatment option to treat PR in patients with native or surgically repaired RVOT. It can delay the time for additional open-heart surgery and potentially reduce the total number of open-heart surgery required over an individual’s lifetime.删除4：<u>31</u>\nUp to the time of writing this article, the Harmony TPV System is the only system with FDA approval in use for native and repaired RVOTs.\nThe Venus P valve (Venus Medtech, Hangzhou, China) is a new generation valve using porcine pericardium leaflets mounted in the middle segment of a self-expanding nitinol stent. The middle segment measures 22-36 mm in diameter and 20-35 mm in length. The proximal and distal ends, like the Harmony valve, are flared to provide an hourglass shape to help anchor in the RVOT and main PA. The delivery system consists of a 19-29 Fr capsule which accommodates the crimped stent valve on a 15 Fr shaft. \nThis valve enables TPVR in RVOT larger than 30 mm. Reports on mid-term results using the Venus P valve are favorable. High success rates with mid-term maintenance of valvar function and high freedom from reintervention were reported. However, stent fractures were reported in up to 27% of patients but the significance of this in the long term is not known yet.32 Anyhow, this system obtained the CE mark approval in Europe in April 2022.\nThe Pulsta valve (TaeWoong Medical Co) is another valve system with a similar concept. Its valve leaflets are also made of porcine pericardium (same as the Harmony and Venus P valves) sutured on a knitted double strand Nitinol wire frame which is also self-expanding. The valve is available in sizes from 18-28 mm with 2 mm increments. The length of the stent is 28-38 mm depending on the valve size and the ends are also flared 4 mm wider than the outer diameter for anchoring . The shaft of the delivery system is 12 Fr while that of the sheath is 18 Fr. There is a \"hook block\" to minimize chances of abrupt delivery and migration.\nIn a Korean feasibility study reported in 2018, 10 TOF patients with PR in native RVOT were treated with the Pulsta valve, five with 26 mm and five with the 28 mm valve. All had successful implantation with no major complications and all 10 implants have good valve function and a significant reduction in RV volume.删除4：<u>28</u>\nThe Med-Zenith PT vale (Beijing Med-Zenith) is a newer generation valve whose leaflets are also made of the porcine pericardium and mounted on a self-expanding nitinol stent . The first human implantation was reported in 2019 with success. So far, about 130 implantations are done with encouraging results.29,30 The clinical trial is still ongoing in China.\nOnly a few reports comparing TPVR and surgical PVR are available. Reports found no differences in mortality, repeat intervention, and cardiovascular readmissions between the two groups.33 A meta-analysis of 1132 TPVR and 4939 surgical PVR also did not show any difference in mortality and reintervention. However, there are fewer procedure-related complications but a higher rate of endocarditis with TPVR.34 Another study showed a higher in-hospital mortality rate and other cardiac complications in surgical PVR. TPVR, on the other hand, had shorter hospital length of stay and therefore less impact on societal loss of wages for patients or caregivers.删除4：<u>35</u>\nThe main purpose of TPVR is 2-fold. First, it is used to restore RVOT function, that is, relieving pulmonary stenosis and eliminating pulmonary regurgitation, so as to restore an acceptable RV loading condition. Secondly, it is used to avoid repeated open-heart operations after surgical PVR as each additional surgical operation will pose increasing risks to patients.\nThe TPVR procedure is rapidly evolving. Being a less invasive procedure with continuous improvement in efficacy and safety, TPVR is capable of providing comparable long-term results as surgical PVR. This procedure becomes a valuable alternative or even the preferred procedure for patients who require PVR in the future because it can be repeated several times, thus avoiding repeated surgical operations.\nIn perspective, firstly, long terms results are still needed as the history of the use of TPVR is still short, particularly for those larger valves for native RVOT. Secondly, smaller and more flexible delivery systems should be developed for use in younger children. Thirdly, the success of TPVR may also impact modification or innovations of surgical techniques at the initial surgical repair in growing children such that further expansion of small conduits is possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

According to the report from the World Health Organization’s International Cancer Research Center, in 2018通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> GC ranked fifth in global cancer incidence and is the third leading cause of death amongst cancer patients. More than one million new cases were reported in 2018. The death toll is estimated at 783,000 per annum (equivalent to one per 12 deaths worldwide). Therefore, prevention and early diagnosis of GC are essential. At present, there is still no simple and efficient means for early screening of GC. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of existing biomarkers for clinical use need to be improved.\nThe continual advancements in the field of molecular biology and extensive use of technologies such as high-throughput sequencing have led to the rapid discovery of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Amongst them, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been determined to be an important class of ncRNAs. Research on circRNAs is gradually expanding. Several studies have shown that circRNA can play an important role in a variety of cancers by acting as an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene. Moreover, studies have confirmed that circRNA can interact with genes involved in GC, thus, participating in GC proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, and metastasis. For example, Zhang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> found that the circLARP4 inhibits biological behaviors of GC cells by sponging miR-424. There is a binding site between miR-424 and large tumor suppressor kinase 1, a core part of the Hippo signaling pathway that functions as a tumor suppressor in GC. Thus, circRNA may play an important role in GC development. Due to its structural specificity and biological stability, circRNA may become a potential target for disease diagnosis and treatment. This article reviews the origin, characteristics, and effects of circRNA, and describes its role in GC development.\nNcRNA refers to RNA which is widely present in various living organisms, but cannot encode proteins, which play an important role in regulating life activities. In the human genome, genes encoding proteins account for only 1% to 2% of all genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Therefore, most genes produce ncRNA.\nCircRNA is a precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) derived from the transcription of RNA transcriptase II.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5,6]</u> It is a special type of endogenous ncRNA. It does not contain the linear structure of the 5′ cap structure and the 3′ poly(A) tail of other RNAs. Instead, it forms a closed-loop structure, which is more stable than traditional linear RNA by covalent bond closure.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,9,10]</u>\nCircRNA was discovered over 40 years ago. As early as 1976, Sanger et al通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> utilized virus-like research and found single-stranded circRNAs in higher plants. In 1979, Hsu et al通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> determined that the content of circRNA in Hela cells accounted for at least 1% to 2% of total RNA content using electron microscopy. However, due to the limited technical means at the time, circRNA was only considered to be a by-product of abnormal splicing of transcripts. Therefore, it did not attract much scientific attention. With the continuous development of molecular purification and high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatic analysis technology is gradually progressing. In recent years, more and more circRNAs have been discovered and further researched. Intensive research has revealed that circRNA is widely present in various tissues, including nerve and liver, and so on.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14,15]</u> and that the differences in circRNA contained in various tissues are also significant. As a result of recent studies, as many as 140,000 circRNAs have been discovered.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,16]</u> This suggests that circRNA may become the largest transcript in human cells.\nThe circRNA of eukaryotic cells is a single-stranded circular structure lacking a free 5′ end cap and a 3′ poly(A) tail. The majority of circRNA is composed of exons; however, some may also contain one or two introns. Depending on the source of the exon and intron in the genome and its constituent sequences, eukaryotic circRNAs can generally be classified into the following three categories: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> exon-derived circRNA molecules (exonic circRNA [ecRNA]), which contains only exons. These exons are connected by a 5′ end-3′ end,通用删除6(英):<u>[8,17]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> circular intronic RNA (ciRNA), which contains only introns and is looped through the 5′ end-2′ end,通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> exon and intron common source circRNA molecules (exon-intron circRNA [EIciRNA]) containing both exons and introns.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Studies have found that the types of circRNA increase with the degree of evolution of a species.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Therefore, the types of circRNAs can be very diverse.\nThe structure of circRNA is different from that of traditional linear RNA, which is a closed RNA formed by non-covalent linkage of exons and/or introns. Studies have found that circRNA has the following characteristics: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> circRNA is widely present in all eukaryotic organisms and is high in content; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> The expression levels of circRNA in different tissues and different developmental stages of the same organism are different. Additionally, the content of circRNA is also very different in different tumor tissues; therefore, it has spatial and temporal specificity. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> As circRNA does not have a 5′ end cap and a 3′ end poly(A) structure, it could not be easily cleaved by exonuclease giving its structural stability compared with linear RNA通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> circRNA is rich in microRNA (miRNA) binding sites, which can bind to corresponding miRNAs and act as a sponge通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> ciRNA has a highly conserved sequence, most of which does not mutate during biological evolution; 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> circRNA can be widely found in human exosomes (small vesicles containing complex RNAs and proteins). At present, there are more than 1000 types of circRNAs in human serum exosomes. The expression of these circRNAs in some tumor tissues is highly specific. Therefore, circRNA can be used as potential tumor markers.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> Other features of circRNA remain to be elucidated.\nThe structural genes of most eukaryotes are split genes. The pre-mRNA directly generated by DNA transcription generally needs to be excised by splicing. The remaining exon sequences are then spliced to form a mature linear mRNA,通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> a split gene. Most circRNAs are also derived from pre-mRNA. However, the difference is in the splicing reaction. In circRNA, the upstream 5′ cleavage site and the downstream 3′ cleavage site are linked by a covalent bond to form a circular transcript. This splicing method is called reverse-splicing.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,25]</u> The synthesis of circRNA is shown in Figure 1. Studies have found that reverse-splicing of pre-mRNA can form three different circRNAs: ecRNA, ciRNA, and EIciRNA. The formation mechanisms of the three circRNAs are as follows:\nThe exon-derived circRNA molecule is mainly located in the cytoplasm and is produced by the exon cyclization pathway. Jeck et al通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> proposed a cyclization mechanism for two exons, namely lariat driven circularization and intron pairing driven circularization. The lariat driven circularization is also known as exon skipping. It refers to the exon skipping of pre-mRNA during post-transcriptional processing during the lariat driven circularization, which brings the distance of the non-adjacent exons closer. Then, by reverse splicing, the 3′ end of the downstream exon splice donor is covalently bound to the 5′ end of the splice acceptor of the upstream exon to form a lasso intermediate. The intron is then removed to form an ecRNA. In the intron pairing driven cyclization process, the introns flanking the circRNA exons are mainly mediated by reverse complementation, which promotes the exon to form a cyclized structure. The intron in the loop is then cleaved and ligated to form an ecRNA. The most common flanking complement is the complementary pairing of Alu and B1, which plays an important role in the process of exon cyclization. The perfectly matched complementary sequence can promote the expression of circRNA.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u>\nIntron-derived circRNA molecules are produced by the intron cyclization pathway and are mainly distributed in the nucleus.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> The formation of ciRNA needs to be driven by several conserved sequences, which mainly include a GU-rich sequence near the 5′-terminal cleavage site (the length of which is seven nucleotides [nt]) and a C-base-rich sequence near the 3′-end branch site (the length of which is 11 nt). Most introns form a lasso structure during the splicing process; however, these structures are degraded by debranching enzymes soon after debranching.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> The specific sequences determined by these lengths are resistant to debranching enzyme degradation. Additionally, the lasso structure formed by the introns is prevented from being degraded. Thereby, a structurally stable circular structure ciRNA is formed, increasing the formation efficiency of ciRNA.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,29]</u> In the process of ciRNA formation, this specific sequence in pre-mRNA is required for the normalization of cyclization. So this specific sequence is a prerequisite for the synthesis of ciRNA by eukaryotes.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>\nEIciRNA molecules are mainly present in the nucleus. In the cyclization process driven by intron pairing, if the intron sequence contained in the RNA molecule is not completely excised, but a part of it is stably retained, an EIciRNA in which the intron and the exon sequence coexist is formed. For example, in the nucleus of cervical cancer HeLa cells, reverse splicing forms the EIciRNA containing the intron.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,30]</u>\nSince circRNA does not have a 5′ end cap and a 3′ poly(A) tail, it is resistant to degradation by ribonuclease R (RNase R, a 3′-5′ exonuclease derived from the Escherichia coli superfamily). Therefore, it is more stable than linear RNA.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> It may be degraded by other means.\nAt present, there are few reports on the mechanism of circRNA degradation. However, studies have found that miR-671 can rely on Argonaute protein (AGO) to directly degrade circRNA sponge for miR-7 (ciRS-7).通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Experiments have also shown that higher concentrations of circRNAs than corresponding linear RNAs have been found in extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes and microvesicles recovered from cell culture fluids.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> This suggests that circRNA can be excreted outside the cell by EVs which may be the cellular clearance mechanism of circRNA.\nThe primary biological role of ncRNA is to regulate gene expression. Studies have shown that, as a member of the ncRNA family, circRNA can also regulate the transcription process of genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> CircRNA is widely distributed in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and can promote gene transcription by binding to the RNA polymerase II complex or proteins involved in transcription, thereby regulating the expression of genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> For example, Li et al通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> found that there are two nuclear EIciRNAs (circEIF3J and circPAIP2) which have sites for binding to small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in the U1 nucleus. These EIciRNAs can regulate gene expression by interacting with snRNA. EIciRNA first forms an EIciRNA-U1snRNP complex with U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which interacts with the RNA polymerase II transcriptional complex in the promoter region of the parental gene to promote gene expression and regulate transcriptional genes.\nAs a short-chain ncRNA molecule, miRNA can specifically bind to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA. This inhibits the translational function of the target mRNA or induces degradation of the target mRNA, and regulates gene expression after transcription.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> Because miRNA can regulate the level of RNA that binds to it, this is called the molecular sponge of miRNA.通用删除6(英):<u>[35,36]</u> Studies have shown that gene expression can also be regulated by the interaction of circRNA with miRNA.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> Many circRNAs bind to their corresponding miRNAs and act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), thereby relieving the negative regulation of miRNA expression on target genes to increase target gene expression levels. This effect is called miRNA sponge action of circRNA.\nThe first circRNA reported to have such an effect is ciRS-7, which was found by Hansen et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Since ciRS-7 contains approximately 70 miR-7 miRNA response elements, it can act as miR-7 sponge. By adsorbing and strongly inhibiting the function of miR-7, it can be negatively regulated.\nIn eukaryotes, more and more circRNAs have been found to contain miRNA binding sites. For example, circHIPK3 can be used as a molecular sponge for many miRNAs.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Wang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> found that heart-related circRNA can be used as a sponge for miR-223. Its binding to miR-233 can inhibit the activity of miRNA, thereby greatly increasing the gene expression downstream of miR-223, ultimately inhibiting cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure and slowing the progression of the disease.\nMiRNAs can participate in normal physiological activities and play an important role in the disease development of diseases. CircRNA can regulate the activity of miRNAs in vivo because of its miRNA molecular sponge. Therefore, circRNA is undoubtedly involved in the regulation of disease development. Due to the structural stability of circRNA, the miRNA’s sponge action is more durable than other types of competitive endogenous RNA.\nAs demonstrated with in-depth studies of circRNA molecules, circRNA not only binds directly to proteins, but also indirectly binds to certain proteins via RNA. CircRNA can bind to RBP to form an RNA-protein complex. This complex regulates the interaction between RNA and RNA-binding proteins to regulate gene transcription and protein activity, thereby affecting the expression level of post-transcriptional genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>\nCertain ecRNA molecules can be used as target sequence elements. They use their complementary sequences to bind RBP, DNA, or RNA through the principle of base complementation, which serves as a bridge between RBP, DNA, and RNA. For example, cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 transcript (CDR1as) can bind tightly to the miRNA’s effector AGO,通用删除6(英):<u>[15,22]</u> which is cleaved and degraded by miR-671. Ashwal-Fluss et al通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> also found in both human and fruit fly studies that the splicing factor (muscle blind, MBL/MBNL1) binds to the second exon to form circRNA (circMBL). The resulting circMBL has a binding site for MBL on the flanking intron. When the intracellular MBL protein content is too high, it promotes the production of circMBL, thereby reducing the mRNA production of the protein.\nStudies have shown that some ncRNAs also have translational functions to produce functional proteins or peptides in vivo.通用删除6(英):<u>[39,40,41]</u> Researchers previously thought that circRNA is one of ncRNAs. There is no suitable internal ribosome entry site (IRES) due to its lack of 5′ end cap and 3′ poly(A) tail structure, so it is impossible to translate into protein. However, it has finally been discovered that there are many genes from which circRNAs are derived. Moreover, exon sequences can also be included in the structure, which may prove that circRNA has a translation function with a coding protein. If these circRNAs contain an IRES, the eukaryotic ribosomal 40S small subunit can enter the IRES of these circRNAs through this site, thereby guiding protein synthesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>\nThe first circRNA discovered to have a protein-encoding function is the RNA of hepatitis D virus (HDV) found by Kos et al通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> HDV is a satellite virus of hepatitis B virus, a single-stranded circRNA molecule with a protein-encoding function. Its circRNA can express pathogenic viral proteins.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> Later, AbouHaidar et al通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> also found that there is a highly stable circRNA molecule of about 220 nt long on the rice yellow spot virus. It is a covalently closed circRNA (RCCC RNA). This type of circRNA has an internal ribosome binding site that binds to the corresponding ribosome and translates a protein with a relative molecular mass of 16,000. Other studies have further confirmed that after the endogenous circRNA begins to be translated, its special structure may make it easier for ribosomes to circulate and participate in the elongation of the polypeptide chain.通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>\nThe functions of circRNA are illustrated in Figure 2.\nIncluding RNA sequencing, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Northern blotting, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), RNase R and RNase H chip technology, RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and biotin-coupled circRNA capture technology are used in circRNA research.\nRNA sequencing is a transcriptomics research method based on second-generation gene sequencing technology. Early RNA sequencing was performed using Ploy(A) tail enrichment to construct a library for sequencing. However, circRNA lacks the Poly(A) tail due to the closed loop structure. Therefore, circRNA has been largely eliminated when constructing the library. Presently, RNA sequencing has begun to construct complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries using ribosomal ribonucleic acid removal and random primer methods combined with a series of algorithmic formulas. This has led to the discovery of abundant circRNA expression in a variety of eukaryotic organisms.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> RT-PCR is the easiest and fastest way to identify circRNA. Primers designed for circRNA reverse splice site sequences allow amplification and quantification of specific circRNAs.\nRNase R is an exonuclease, which is capable of degrading RNA containing 5′ and 3′ ends. It can be combined with RT-PCR to identify circRNA and can also be used for sequencing circRNA purification and sequencing results.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> Starke et al通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> utilized a combination of Northern blotting and RNase H. verified that the exon circRNA has a closed loop structure. Northern blotting recognized the circularized exon sequence by the designed probe. RNase H is an endoribonuclease that cleaves RNA when DNA and RNA hybridize. This method effectively distinguishes between circRNA and trans-splicing products.\nIn 2D-PAGE, linear RNAs move diagonally according to their size, while circRNA moves in an arc. Therefore, 2D-PAGE can be used to enrich and quantify circRNA for sequencing and to quantify and characterize it.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> In other methods, chip technology is mainly used to screen circRNA. The biotin-coupled circRNA capture technology is a circRNA northern blotting technique based on multi-biotin signal amplification with high sensitivity.\nIt mainly includes circRNA overexpression by constructing related vectors, designing siRNA, and small hairpin RNA knockdown (knockout) circRNA. For example, by transfecting the pcDNA3-ciRS-7 recombinant plasmid into zebrafish embryos, ciRS-7 overexpression can be achieved. It has been found to affect brain development. Zhang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> used siRNA technology to study the role of circRNA in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and found that hsa_circ_0007534 can inhibit the proliferation of colorectal cells and induce apoptosis.\nAt present, there are two main methods for studying the interaction between circRNA and miRNA, namely dualluciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP).通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The dual-luciferase reporter assay first constructs a luciferase reporter vector containing the circRNA fragment of interest and then co-transfects the miRNA with the reporter gene into the cell. The binding of miRNA to circRNA is verified by detecting the activity of firefly and Renilla luciferase.\nThe interaction between circRNA and miRNA can also be achieved by RIP of AGO protein in combination with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Since circRNA, miRNA, and AGO proteins can co-localize in cells, AGO proteins can be enriched by antibody-specific binding purification to explore the number, changes, and interactions of circRNA and miRNA. This method can be used to verify the \"sponge effect\" of circRNA adsorption on miRNAs.\nIt has been reported that circRNA is differentially expressed in many cancers and can affect cancer occurrence, development, and metastasis. Therefore, circRNA plays an important role in GC.\nSince the discovery of circRNA, its relationship with tumors has been a hot topic of research. Researchers hope to further elucidate the pathogenesis of tumors through the study of circRNA, and find novel methods of diagnosis and treatment. A large number of studies have shown that there are several differentially expressed circRNAs in GC. Some expression levels were significantly elevated, while others were decreased. These differentially expressed circRNAs are summarized in Table 1. For example, in a study by Xie et al通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>, hsa_circ_0074362 was significantly down-regulated in GC tissue when compared with adjacent tissues. Similarly, Li et al通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u> also found that hsa_circ_0001017 and hsa_circ_0061276 were significantly decreased in GC patients’ plasma. In another example, Lu et al通用删除6(英):<u>[70]</u> found that hsa_circ_0000467 was up-regulated in GC tissues, plasma and cell lines. The discovery of these differentially expressed circRNAs indicates that circRNA is involved in GC development and progression, providing new clues for revealing the mechanism of GC and providing a new direction for its diagnosis and treatment.\nDifferential expression and functions of circRNAs in gastric cancer.\n删除重复语句：<u>Differential expression and functions of circRNAs in gastric cancer.</u>\nGC: Gastric cancer; LATS1: Large tumor suppressor kinase 1; PHLDA1: Pleckstrin homologous domain family member 1; FOXO3: Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3); ZFR: Zinc finger RNA-binding protein; PTEN: Phosphatase and tensin homolog; RUNX3: Runt-associated transcription factor 3; XIAP: X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; CACUL1: CDK2-associated cullin 1; MMP-19: Matrix metalloproteinase 19; YBX1: Y-box binding protein 1; CDK6: Cyclin-dependent kinase 6; CREB1: Cyclic AMP response element-binding protein 1.\nZhao et al通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> found that the level of hsa_circ_0000181 in GC patients’ tissues and plasma was significantly lower than that of non-tumor tissues or healthy human plasma. The expression of hsa_circ_0000181 in GC tissues was significantly correlated with tumor diameter, lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (P < 0.05). The decrease of hsa_circ_0000181 in the plasma of patients was significantly correlated with differentiation and carcinoembryonic antigen (P < 0.05). Therefore, detection of hsa_circ_0000181 in tissues and plasma may be a biomarker for GC diagnosis. Tian et al通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> also found that the expression level of hsa_circ_0003159 was significantly negatively correlated with gender, distant metastasis, and tumor-lymph node metastasis. Therefore, hsa_circ_0003159 may be a potential tumor biomarker for GC.\nChen et al通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> found that hsa_circ_0000190 was downregulated in GC patients’ tissues and plasma (P < 0.001) and its expression level was significantly correlated with tumor diameter, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage and CA19-9 level (P < 0.05). The combined determination of tissue and plasma circRNA can improve the accuracy of diagnosis, indicating that hsa_circ_0000190 may be a novel non-invasive biomarker for the diagnosis of GC.\nWang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u> studied the mechanism of action of circRNA in the GC suppressor gene pleckstrin homologous domain family member 1 (PHLDA1). The circRNA expression profile of the circRNA gene chip in GC tissues showed that hsa_circ_0027599 (circ_0027599) was significantly downregulated in GC tissues when compared to the control. Overexpression of circ_0027599 inhibits proliferation and metastasis of GC cells. Using bioinformatics tools and luciferase reporter assays, it was confirmed that circ_0027599 is a sponge of miR-101-3p.1 (miR-101), which inhibits the survival and metastasis of cancer cells. It was also confirmed that PHLDA1 is regulated by circ_0027599 in GC cells. Therefore, the study found that PHLDA1 is regulated by circ_0027599/miR-101, which can inhibit the survival and metastasis of GC.\nLu et al通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u> found that hsa_circ_0001368 was widely downregulated in GC tissues and cells, which was associated with poor prognosis in patients with GC. Functional experiments have shown that knocking down hsa_circ_0001368 can promote cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, the knockdown of hsa_circ_0001368 also leads to accelerated growth of tumors in vivo. Subsequently, it was confirmed that hsa_circ_0001368 was used as a ceRNA of the sponge miR-6506-5p. Although forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) can serve as a functional target of miR-6506-5p, knocking out hsa_circ_0001368 reduced the expression of the tumor suppressor gene FOXO3. Therefore, research shows that in GC, hsa_circ_0001368 can exert tumor-suppressive effects through the miR-6506-5p/FOXO3 axis.\nZhang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[79]</u> verified the expression of circ_0067997 in GC tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR. High circ_0067997 expression was associated with low overall survival rate in GC patients. Knocking out circ_0067997 significantly reduced cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) can be targeted and regulated by miR-515-5p, while circ_0067997 is directly identified as a sponge of miR-515-5p. Therefore, circ_0067997 can promote GC development by regulating the miR-515-5p/XIAP axis.\nHuang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[81]</u> screened the up-regulated circRNA-hsa_circ_0008035 in microarray data. Functional experiments showed that siRNA-transfected hsa_circ_0008035 reduced the proliferation and invasion of GC cells. Hsa_circ_0008035 acts as a sponge for miR-375 and reduces its expression, while miR-375 can target Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) 3′-UTR. Therefore, hsa_circ_0008035 promotes proliferation and invasion of GC cells by modulating the miR-375/YBX1 axis.\nChen et al通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u> found a significant up-regulation of circPVT1 levels in a series of differentially expressed circRNA studies in GC. After predictive analysis and experiments, circPVT1 can be used as a \"sponge\" of miR-125, which competes with the miR-125 family and let-7 to regulate the expression of these miRNA target genes. This promotes the proliferation of GC cells. CircPVT1 is closely related to GC patient prognosis. High circPVT1 levels have been correlated with higher survival rates, which may be related to miR-125 with an anti-cancer effect. Additionally, circPVT1 can be used as a prognostic indicator of overall survival and disease-free survival independent of clinicopathological parameters such as tumor size and TNM staging. Therefore, circPVT1 can be used as an independent parameter for analyzing the prognosis of GC patients and is a new proliferative factor and prognostic indicator for GC.\nXue et al通用删除6(英):<u>[84]</u> found that hsa_circ_0081143 was up-regulated in GC tissues. Correlation analysis showed that the high expression of hsa_circ_0081143 was associated with poor TNM staging, lymph node metastasis, and overall survival. Then, through functional experiments, it was found that hsa_circ_0081143 inhibition not only decreases the viability of GC cells, reduces their invasive ability, but also induces GC cell sensitivity to cisplatin (DDP). Next, the interaction between hsa_circ_0081143 and miR-646 was determined. Hsa_circ_0081143 was demonstrated to act as an endogenous sponge by directly binding to miR-646. The downregulation of miR-646 effectively reversed the inhibitory effect of hsa_circ_0081143 knockdown on cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). In addition, hsa_circ_0081143 silencing inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo and significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of DDP on GC cells. Therefore, hsa_circ_0081143 can be a potential new therapeutic strategy for GC therapy through the role of the hsa_circ_0081143/miR-646/CDK6 axis.\nPan et al通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u> found that ciRS-7 can interfere with the inhibitory effect of miR-7 on the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) pathway, thereby promoting GC cell proliferation. Previous studies have shown that the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway stimulates aerobic glycolysis. Thus, ciRS-7 may regulate the metabolism of GC cells through this pathway. It can be seen that the circRNA/miRNA regulatory axis may also play an important role in regulating the metabolism of gastrointestinal tumors.\nStudies have shown that the tumor cell’s own circRNA is closely related to the gastrointestinal tumor microenvironment. The occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells is associated with a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in vimentin in the microenvironment. Li et al通用删除6(英):<u>[77]</u> demonstrated that the expression of circ-104916 was down-regulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of circ-104916 can down-regulate the content of vimentin in the microenvironment of GC and upregulate the content of E-cadherin, ultimately inhibiting the EMT process of GC cells. Therefore, the use of circRNA to regulate the tumor microenvironment of GC will have potential application value.\nMore and more studies show that circRNAs may have potential for early diagnosis and treatment targets.通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u> However, there is still a lack of multi-center clinical research data and their specific functions in the pathophysiology of GC development and molecular biological behavior are still not very clear. This topic requires further in-depth investigation. In the near future, they are likely to be useful and effective targets for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of GC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}
{"seq_id": "587bbdbc-f49a-4eeb-bebe-6b4479e433ff", "title": "", "text": "【0】Pathological scars, which mainly consist of hypertrophic scars and keloids, are large areas of proliferating fibroblasts accompanied by disordered apoptosis, excessive deposition of collagen and glycoproteins in the extracellular matrix.1,2 The proposed pathological mechanism of scar formation is controversial, and studies have focused mainly on genetic,3 vascular,4 immunological, neurogenic,5 and nutritional factors.6 Moreover, increasing attention has been paid to the effect of lipids in the formation of pathological scars, and fatty acid (FA) is an important class of functional lipids.\nThe lipid profiles in pathological scars showed constitutional changes. From a nutritional perspective, keloids contained decreased levels of membrane essential fatty acid (EFA),7 linoleic acid8 and increased arachidonic acid (AA),9 less abundant of cholesterol esters, wax esters, triglycerides, and ceramides compared to normal skin.10 Notably, lipids are related to various pathological mechanisms, including inflammation, secondary messengers and mechanotransduction.11 Moreover, the potential biological effects of FAs on wound healing have been investigated, and treatments related to FAs in scars have been studied.12,13 However, the altered FAs involved in pathological scars compared to normal skin remain unclear.\nFAs include saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). PUFAs are EFAs that cannot be synthesized in vivo, but the components of their metabolism are important inflammation-related factors. So, the metabolism and dietary intake of PUFAs may influence the formation of pathological scars. Additionally, some kinds of FAs could be synthesized in vivo. In the process of FA synthesis in the human body, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) are the key enzymes of endogenous syntrophic fatty acid synthesis.\nThe role of FAs plays in pathological scars is worthy of researching. As a result, we conducted this study to 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> determine whether the FA content in pathological scars differs from that in normal skins, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> explore whether the expression of SREBP1 and FASN in pathological scars and their dermal fibroblasts is abnormal, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> speculate on the relationship between the processes of FA synthesis and metabolism and the pathological scars.\nThe investigative protocol was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed consent has been obtained from each patient. Hypertrophic scar and keloid formed for more than a year and normal skin samples were obtained from patients who underwent plastic surgery (Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, the Fourth Medical Centre, Chinese PLA General Hospital and Plastic Surgery Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College). Patients with less than 1 year of scar formation or with other treatments will be excluded. Patients with underlying disease would also be excluded. Ultimately, a total of 30 samples were collected, and hematoxylin and eosin staining  was used to determine the sample type.\nDermal tissues were washed 3 times with phosphate buffer saline and then minced into pieces (about 1 mm). Pieces were explanted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco BRL, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL, NY, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Solarbio, China) at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. The medium was changed every 2 days. At 7-10 days after the primary culture, it was confirmed that the cells had proliferated on the dishes from the edge of the explanted tissue. Then, the cells were passaged 1-2 times per week.\nParaffin-embedded tissue sections of 4 μm serial sections were subjected to gradual deparaffinization. Antigen retrieval was carried out by immersing the slides in citrate buffer and incubating for 10 min at 100°C. Sections were rinsed in water and blocked in 10% normal goat IgG for 20 min. The samples were incubated in primary mouse monoclonal anti-SREBP1 and anti-FASN antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, US) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed in phosphate buffer saline, followed by 20 min incubation in 3% hydrogen peroxide in dH2O. Biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (ZSGQ-BIO, China) was added for 20 min at room temperature. DAB reagent (Beyotime Biotechnology, China) was applied for 2-3 min, and hematoxylin (Beyotime Biotechnology, China) was applied for 2 min to restain nuclei.\nA TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen, USA) was used for RNA extraction. The isolated RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA using the Prime Script RT Reagent kit (Takara, China). Primers were obtained from Takara Biotechnology. Quantitative PCR was performed using the CFX96™ real-time system (Bio-Rad, USA), using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara, China) in a 12 μl PCR solution. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1. The results were normalized against the mean Ct values for GAPDH using the ΔCt method as follows: ΔCt= Ct gene of interest - mean Ct (GAPDH).

Cells were then centrifuged at 14,000×g at 4°C to remove cell debris. Samples containing 50 μg of protein were loaded onto a 5%-10% polyacrylamide gel, separated by electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The markers were tested by exposing the membranes to primary antibodies (Santa, USA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Epizyme, China) antibody was used as the secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system using a Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR+ (Bio-Rad, USA). Blots were detected using ImageLab™ software, version 5.1 (Bio-Rad).\nEach sample was mixed with 10 prechilled zirconium oxide beads and 20 μL deionized water. After homogenized for 3 min, 150 μL methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) containing internal standard was added to extract the metabolites. Supernatant was transferred to the 96-well plate after centrifuged at 18,000×g for 20 min; and 20 μL derivative reagents were added to each well, which was sealed, and derivatization at 30°C for 60 min. Then, 400 μL of an ice-cold 50% methanol solution was added to the samples after evaporated for 2 h. The plate was stored at -20°C for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 4000×g and 4°C for 30 min. A 135 μL volume of supernatant was transferred to a new plate with 15 μL internal standards. Finally, the plate was sealed for lipid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis.\nThe data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test at a significance level of 5% were used to determine statistically significant differences. The LC-MS data were analyzed by orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) using QuanMET software (Ver. 2.0, Metabo-Profile, Shanghai, China) (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,****p < 0.0001). The values are shown in the figures.\nIn total, 52 FAs, including 8 short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were detected. Results of OPLS-DA showed 27 differential FAs in keloids  and 15 differential FAs in hypertrophic scars  compared to full-thickness normal skin (p < 0.05 and variable influence on projection >1.0), respectively. Among the altered SCFAs, the expression of butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid and succinic acid were the highest in hypertrophic scars, followed by normal skins, and significantly decreased in keloids. Of the other 44 FAs, we found that differential expression was in 22 FAs in keloids compared with normal skins. However, only 13 differential FAs were identified in hypertrophic scars.\nDifferential fatty acids of the full-thickness skin between keloid and normal skin.\n删除重复语句：<u>Differential fatty acids of the full-thickness skin between keloid and normal skin.</u>\nVIP: variable influence on projection.\na \"down\" means the expression of this fatty acid in keloid was lower than that in normal skin; on the contrary, \"up\" means this fatty acid in keloid was higher expression.\nDifferential fatty acids of the full thickness between hypertrophic scar and normal skin.\n删除重复语句：<u>Differential fatty acids of the full thickness between hypertrophic scar and normal skin.</u>\nVIP: variable influence on projection.\na \"down\" means the expression of this fatty acid in hypertrophic scar was lower than that in normal skin; on the contrary, \"up\" means this fatty acid in hypertrophic scar was higher expression.\nIn the whole layer tissue, the results of immunohistochemistry  and RT-PCR  showed that the mRNA expression of SREBP1 was lower in hypertrophic scars and keloids than in normal tissues. However, at the level of dermal fibroblasts, the expression of SREBP1 in KFBs was higher than that in NFBs, while its expression in hypertrophic scar-derived fibroblasts (HFBs) was lower than that in NFBs both at the mRNA and protein level .\nAs shown in immunohistochemistry  and RT-PCR  of full-thickness skin tissues, the expression of FASN was downregulated in hypertrophic scars and keloids. However, the mRNA expression of FASN in KFBs was higher than that in NFBs, but decreased in HFBs . In terms of protein expression, the fibroblasts showed a slightly different trend: there was no significant difference in FASN protein expression between KFBs and NFBs .\nFrom the above results, we found that the expression of SREBP1 and FASN in hypertrophic scars and keloids was lower than that in normal skin in terms of full-thickness skin, which is consistent with the trend in long-chain SFA in pathological scars. However, at the level of dermal fibroblasts, the mRNA expression of SREBP1 and FASN in KFBs was higher than that of NFBs, while was lower in HFBs. The difference between full-thickness skin and dermal fibroblasts may be attributed to expression in the epidermis.\nPathological scars are thought to be closely related to the occurrence of inflammation. Prostaglandins (PGs) are key components of inflammatory processes. Furthermore, PGs have been described as critical components in wound healing, tissue regeneration and fibrosis,14 such as PGE2,15 PGD2 and 15d-PGJ216.\nIn addition, PGs are the main components of PUFA metabolism. Omega-6 and omega-3 FAs are the two major families of PUFAs. Excessive production of AA-derived eicosanoids, which including PGs, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes, are associated with the regulation and mediation of inflammatory processes.17,18 Cells involved in the inflammatory response are typically rich in the omega-6 fatty acid AA, but the AA contents can be altered through the administration of EPA and DHA. In our study, most PUFAs, such as AA, DPA, EPA, and DPAn-6, were more highly expressed in keloids and hypertrophic scars.\nMoreover, SCFAs are also related to the regulation of inflammation, especially butyrate and propionate. A lack of SCFAs produces inflammatory mediators by inhibiting the activation of mast cells.19 In this study, a lack of SCFAs, such as butyric acid, was observed in keloids. This would influence the apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation of keloid-derived fibroblasts and cause collagen deposition. An in vitro study20 on keloid treatment in which butyrate was applied to keloid-derived fibroblasts for coculture verified this speculation. The results show that butyrate inhibits fibroblast proliferation, type III collagen expression, and PGE2 production but upregulates the expression of cyclooxygenase 1.\nIn addition to dietary intake, SFAs are FAs that could be synthesized by human body. FASN and SREBP1 are key factors in this process. Pathological scars are tumor-like tissue, and dermal-derived fibroblasts are fast-proliferating cells. Increased lipid production is one of the important metabolic markers of rapidly proliferating cells. Most normal cells obtain lots of FAs directly from the circulation to meet their metabolic and material synthetic needs. In tumor cells, which are rapidly proliferating cells, more than 90% of FAs, so-called de novo synthesis endogenous FAs, are obtained through self-synthesis.21 This process is completely independent of the normal pathway of FA synthesis.\nMoreover, SREBP-1 and FASN are closely related to the abnormal FA synthesis of rapidly proliferating cells. SREBP-1 is an important transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of sterols and lipids in the de novo synthesis pathway and directly regulates the expression of key enzymes. FASN, which provides the energy needed for the survival of proliferating cells, is a critical enzyme in the abnormal metabolism of endogenous syntrophic saturated fatty acid.22,23 The activity of FASN was found to be increased in a variety of rapidly proliferating cells, and this increase was closely related to poor prognosis.24,25 KFBs are also abnormally active and proliferative cells, and the expression of SREBP and FASN in the de novo synthesis of FAs would be a direction for the mechanism of keloids.\nThe mechanism of pathological scar formation is generally focused on dermis-derived fibroblasts. According to the results, at the level of dermal fibroblasts, the mRNA expression of SREBP1 and FASN in KFBs was higher than that of NFBs, while was lower in HFBs. Then we speculate that the de novo FA synthesis pathway is abnormal in pathological scars and this process is active in keloid fibroblasts but inactive in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts.\nNutrition and treatment related to the FAs on pathological scars are also concerned by doctors. Given that some PUFAs exhibit different levels in pathological scars, we believe that EFA-related intake and dietary habits may affect pathological scars formation. Omega-6 PUFAs derived from linoleic acid and omega-3 PUFAs derived from Alpha-Linolenic acid are EFAs involved in the body's functions. LA and Alpha-Linolenic acid must be wholly derived from the diet.26 A retrospective questionnaire study performed in South Africa by Louw et al.27 found that individuals with keloids consumed higher levels of LA and AA, and the consumption of omega-6 PUFAs was lower than the amount recommended by the joint World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization (5%-8% of the PUFAs28). Based on these findings, some scholars have carried out several studies on the treatment of pathological scars with FA-related substances and achieved certain results.12,13 Furthermore, an in vitro study found that DHA has antifibrogenic effects on keloid fibroblasts.删除4：<u>29</u>\nIn conclusions, the synthesis and metabolism of FAs are important parts of regulation of the body. The type and quantity of FAs in hypertrophic scars and keloids are different from normal skin, and in the process of endogenous FA synthesis, the expression of SREBP1 and FASN in pathological scar-derived dermal fibroblasts is abnormal. Thus, FA synthesis and metabolism would be critical directions in pathological scar formation, and in-depth study would be done for the prevention and treatment of pathological scars.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

CRSwNPis a chronic inflammatory mucosal disease of the nose and sinuses. It is moderately common within the population with a prevalence of 2%－5%1,2,3 and occurs mainly after the age of 30.4 The prevalence increases with age (5% at 60 years of age and older) and the annual direct cost for CRS is estimated to be approximately $10 billion.5,6,7,8,9,10,11Associations between CRSwNP and ciliary impairment,12 asthma,13,14 aspirin sensitivity4 and immunocompromised state15,16 have been described. Furthermore, exogenic (chemical-physical or infectious) as well as endogenic (genetic, hormonal, immunological and metabolic) factors have been explored.15,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 Histologically eosinophilic infiltration of the mucosa and secretions can be detected.27,28 The degree of tissue eosinophilia correlates with objective disease severity and co-morbid asthma.5,7,21,29,30 Despite recent advances in our understanding of CRSwNP, the etiopathology of the disease state remains unclear. Consequently, optimal diagnostic and treatment algorithms remain elusive as no single accurate biosignature of CRSwNP has yet been developed.删除4：<u>21</u>\nExosomes are spherical to cup-shaped, 30-150 nm31,32membrane-bound vesicles. They consist of a lipid bilayer derived from their host cell and incorporate proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA that are specific to their cell of origin.33,34,35 Exosomes are secreted by virtually all cell types into almost all body fluids including nasal mucus.36 Due to their ubiquitous presence, their specificity to their cell of origin, and their easy accessibility, exosomes exhibit great potential for non-invasive diagnostics.37 Biomarkers may be defined as biological substances that are specific and sensitive to a particular physiological or pathological condition. Because exosomes are cell specific and reflective of particular cell functions, they may be used to develop novel biomarkers for clinical diagnosis. Moreover, exosomes protect their cargo from degradation by nucleases and proteases thereby increasing biomarker half-life which can serve to facilitate downstream molecular analyses.38 The objective of this article is to therefore review the current knowledge regarding the role of exosomes as contributors to both health and disease and as sources of diagnostic material in CRSwNP.\nThere are several hypotheses regarding the physiologic function of exosomes. Generally, exosomes are thought to act as intercellular shuttles by transferring functional nucleic acids and proteins between cells.35,39 The nasal cavity is a mucosal barrier that represents one of the first sites of contact between the environment and the body. As a consequence, this barrier harbors a variety of protective mechanisms to defend against pathogens. Amongst those, mucociliary clearance (MCC)40 and epithelial expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been described. The stimulation of TLRs by microbial structural motifs known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)41,42 has been shown to release antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)43,44,45 into the nasal mucus (unpublished data). Early evidence suggests that nasal mucosa derived exosomes (NMDEs)may transport these AMPs directly to the surface of the pathogen thereby inducing direct microbiocidal effects as well as donating these AMPs to adjacent, pathogen naive, epithelia (unpublished data). Finally, NMDEs are able to promote the migration of several immune cells in vitro including monocytes, neutrophils and NK cells further contributing to mucosal immune defense.删除4：<u>46</u>\nBeyond their innate immune physiologic activity, NMDEs are also believed to play a role in the spread of pathologies such as cancer or inflammatory disease via autocrine, endocrine and paracrine pathways of secretion as well as through mucociliary clearance.47 Exosomal P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux pump which drives type-2 helper T-cell inflammation in CRSwNP, has been shown to be present and significantly enriched in CRSwNP exosomes relative to controls.47,48 High P-gp secretion has also been associated with worse subjective as well as objective measures of disease severity.48Previous studies have shown that NMDEs are capable of the rapid inter-epithelial transfer of proinflammatory proteins, including P-gp, which function to propagate inflammation in the setting of CRS and create a field inflammatory effect.删除4：<u>47</u>\nThe development of a reproducible, non-invasive, serial, and quantitative \"liquid biopsy\" for rhinosinusitis represents a holy grail in rhinology. Ideally, these biomarkers would mirror the sensitivity and specificity of a tissue biopsy while allowing non-invasive outpatient sampling. This would also enable prospective, serial testing in clinic for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. In the comparison between whole mucus and exosomes isolated from whole nasal mucus, the proteomic perturbations indicative of CRSwNP within tissue are highly reflected in the exosomal population leading to a 20-fold increase in the number of overlapping differentially regulated proteins within exosomes as compared to whole mucus. Additionally, interpatient variance is significantly lower in the exosomes than in matched whole mucus samples (unpublished data). To increase reproducibility and specificity of the \"liquid biopsy\" , a high signal-to-noise ratio is crucial. Exosomes represent encapsulated proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA from the cell of origin whereas whole mucus represents a heterogenous mixture of cellular debris, cytokines and degraded proteins fragments. Furthermore, the exosomal proteome is protected from degradation by nucleases and proteases there by contributing to its stability as a biomarker substrate.\nHistorically, two major challenges with exosomal proteomic work have been described. The first has been the low sample volume available after ultracentrifugation dependent purification. However, there are techniques including SOMAscan (SomaLogic), a highly multiplexed, sensitive, and quantitative immune-like proteomic tool, which are capable of handling the small sample size and a 12-13 log difference in expression.59 The second challenge lies in the relatively easy but long and expensive exosome isolation. The most common technique for concentrating exosomes is ultracentrifugation. Other techniques include immunoaffinity-based isolation techniques, commercial precipitation kits, acoustic nano-filter systems and the nanowire-on-micropillar technique. Optimization and validation of the most effective methods remain a barrier to the adoption of exosomal analysis in routine clinical practice.删除4：<u>50</u>\nAs previously noted, exosomal P-gp represents a noninvasive biomarker that can be used to predict pathological patterns and disease severity. For this reason, P-gp has also been identified as a potential drug target for treating CRSwNP. A recent double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial demonstrated that verapamil, a well-known and tolerated inhibitor of P-gp, was capable of reducing both subjective and objective measures of CRSwNP.51 Other exosomal biomarkers which have been identified in CRS include proteins of the fibrinolysis coagulation cascades. The fibrinolysis pathway was shown to be down regulated whereas the coagulation cascade was upregulated (unpublished data). These findings lend further support to the hypothesis that proteolytic imbalances may play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of CRSwNP.52,53 Due to the reproducible protein expression pattern, the exosomal proteins of these pathways could potentially be utilized as a disease biosignature.\nRecent studies of exosomes in CRS have suggested that they not only participate in disease pathogenesis but may also be used as a substrate for stable, non-invasive biomarkers of disease. Simultaneously, this research has led to important revelations about the physiologic function of exosomes as they seem to play an important role ininnate nasal immunosurveillance and antimicrobial defense.\nNone.\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-forprofit sectors.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.wjorl.2018.07.005</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Altogether, 172 of 181 pSS patients with skin lesions, and 660 of 693 pSS patients without skin lesions were regularly followed for at least one year at our clinic. The percentage of lost-of-follow-up was 4.9% and 4.7% in patients with and without mucocutaneous lesions. No death occurred during the study.\nAmong pSS patients with mucocutaneous lesions, there were two cases of leukopenia, one hyperthyroidism, one rheumatoid arthritis, and one nephritis. Another patient had repetitive low-grade fever of unknown origin, which was attributed to disease deterioration after excluding other possibilities.\nAmong patients without mucocutaneous lesions, there were two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis, one interstitial lung disease, one leukopenia, one systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and one lymphoma.\nAll above mentioned complications were properly treated.\nAfter initial visits and evaluations, five pSS patients with mucocutaneous lesions had new complications, while six new cases of complications were identified in patients without mucocutaneous lesions, accounting for 2.9% and 0.9%, respectively (P > 0.05).\nMucocutaneous manifestations are commonly seen in patients with pSS. Literature reported that more than half of pSS patients had mucocutaneous presentations, if xerosis (xerodema) was taken into account,通用删除6(英):<u>[6,10]</u> which was regarded by someone as the most common form of pSS skin lesions.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> The proportion reported in our study was 20.7%, which is compliant to our expectation since we did not include xeroderma. Based on our results, the profile of mucocutaneous lesions in pSS patients was consistent with previous literature.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,6,11,12,13,14,15]</u> Purpuric eruptions was the most common form, followed by urticaria, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and angular stomatitis. These four forms composed more than 88% of the total mucocutaneous lesions. Purpuric eruptions and urticarial vasculitis are categorized as cutaneous vasculitis and together accounted for 42% of all skin lesions. Raynaud’s phenomenon is also related to vasculitis since it can be caused by vasculitis through structural damage to blood vessels. Higher incidence of Raynaud’s phenomenon was showed in the subgroup of pSS patients with cutaneous vasculitis by another study.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Angular stomatosis had rarely been reported as dermatological manifestation of pSS, which might indicate its independence from pSS in terms of pathogenesis.\nTable 4 demonstrates no significant differences in proportions of common first-onset symptoms of pSS patients between the two groups, except for purpuric eruptions. Notably, 39.8% of pSS patients with mucocutaneous lesions had purpuric eruptions, and among those patients, 61% presented them as first-onset symptom. This reminds us that mucocutaneous lesions might be early clinical manifestations of pSS patients, although they might predict a worse prognosis.\nUp to now, mechanism of mucocutaneous lesions of pSS has not been thoroughly clarified. Our study showed that, after excluding the influence of therapeutic corticosteroid, higher level of IgG and lower level of C4 were detected in those with mucocutaneous lesions. We thought that these results might indicate a core status of immuno-inflammatory reaction in the pathogenesis of mucocutaneous lesions in pSS patients. Previous studies had already provided us with some unnegligible clues. Ramos-Casals et al. reported hypergammaglobulinemia in 50% of pSS patients with cutaneous purpura not associated with cryoglobulinemia, and the main histologic diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis was leukocytoclastic vasculitis.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Ramos-Casals et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> also found that pSS patients with low C4 level had a higher incidence of cutaneous vasculitis. Chronic immuno-inflammatory reaction might also be related to nonvasculitic skin lesions, such as hives and erythema nodosum. It was reported that, except for pSS, chronic urticaria happened frequently in many other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, and Type I diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> As for those mucocutaneous infections in pSS patients, disturbed immune defense is thought to play an important role.\nSpectrum of pSS is extremely broad, varying from slowly progressive autoimmune exocrinopathy to potentially life-threatening systemic disorder.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Only about 8% of pSS patients did not exhibit systemic manifestations.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> We found that pSS patients with mucocutaneous lesions are more frequently suffering from pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary bullae, anemia, and leukopenia. These results were in agreement with other studies, which concluded that pSS patients with interstitial lung diseases were more frequently having Raynaud’s phenomenon, and the probable underlying mechanism proposed was an ischemic process contributing to both dermatological and pulmonary damage.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,20]</u>\nMany studies indicated that the mechanism for systemic damages of pSS was immuno-inflammatory reaction, same as what we proposed above to explain the mucocutaneous lesions of pSS. Yazisiz et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> identified higher level of Ig as a predictive marker for lung disease in pSS. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a main cause of anemia in pSS patients, as well as neutropenia, were all illustrated to be related with hypocomplementemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u> In other words, mucocutaneous lesions and other systemic damages of pSS patients might essentially be the manifestations of a common underlying disorder, a severe immuno-inflammatory reaction, indicating high activity of the primary disease.\nTo gain a deeper insight into the pathological process mentioned above, we may search for molecular biological tools to study cytokines and adhesion molecules so that our hypothesis might be proved on microscopic level. Cytokines and adhesion molecules promote chronic inflammatory response. They might play a central role in the initiation and progression of pSS.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u> Cell adhesion molecules are expressed in tunica intima as well as perivascular inflammatory cells, where they involve in the pathogenesis of cutaneous vasculitis.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> They might also contribute to pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis,通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> as well as anemia of chronic diseases by inhibiting proliferation of erythrocyte progenitors, modulating iron metabolism, and suppressing EPO production.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>\nComparison of complication occurrence rates after one-year follow-up did not show significant result, which could be attributed to the small incidence of new complications. For most patients, pSS was a slowly progressing chronic disease, with low probability of new complications coming up within a short period of time.\nThe strength of our study relies on the large number of participants and systematic collection of data. No previous study concerning the subgroup of pSS patients with mucocutaneous lesions was done in such a large scale. For the first time, we demonstrated the connection of mucocutaneous lesions with certain kinds of systemic damages, and we also proposed a hypothesis for the underlying mechanism. There were also limitations in our study. For instance, it would be better if we could follow pSS patients for a longer period. In this way, we might directly prove that mucocutaneous lesions of pSS can serve as a predictor for long-term prognosis.\nIn summary, the common mucocutaneous lesions of pSS include purpuric eruptions, hives, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and angular stomatitis. In accordance with previous studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[18,28,29,30]</u> pSS patients with mucocutaneous lesions in our study were more likely to have systemic damages, including pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary bullae, leukemia, and anemia. They also have higher level of IgG and lower level of serum C4, suggesting a higher activity of the primary disease.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81371731)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The incidence of premature ovarian failure (POF), which seriously affects reproductive function and consequently mental health, is significantly higher in women with SLE than in healthy women.1 Therefore, the protection of ovarian function in patients with SLE is of great clinical interest. Gonadal toxicity of cyclophosphamide treatment is more likely to be associated with POF in patients with SLE;2 however, immune abnormalities could also be involved.3 The involvement and role of abnormal immune function in POF remain unclear. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown considerable safety and efficacy in the treatment of POF in animal models.4 However, the use of MSCs to treat POF in lupus mice has not been reported. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUC-MSCs) are capable of several functions, such as self-renewal, multidirectional differentiation, and immune regulation. They are also easy to obtain and are not associated with ethical concerns. HUC-MSCs have been used in the clinical treatment of several diseases, including refractory lupus nephritis.删除4：<u>5</u>\nThe main aim of this study was to examine the ovarian function and the occurrence of POF in lupus mice. We also aimed to determine the effects of HUC-MSCs transplantation on ovarian function in lupus mice. Furthermore, we aimed to identify potential mechanisms underlying these effects, to provide a theoretical basis for the development of HUC-MSCs-based strategies for the treatment of POF in patients with SLE.\nWe used 30 specific pathogen-free (SPF) female MRL/lpr mice (6 weeks old female; Shanghai Lingchang Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Shanghai, China, license number: SCXK, 2013-0018), with typical characteristics including hypersplenotrophy due to lymphocyte proliferation accompanying proteinuria and appearance of various autoantibodies, and 6 SPF female C57BL/6 mice (6 weeks old; Experimental Animal Center of Jiangsu University, license number: SCXK, 2013-0011). All experimental mice were raised in the SPF-class breeding area of the Animal Experiment Center of Jiangsu University until they were 20 weeks old. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of Jiangsu University. The MRL/lpr mice were randomly divided into the MSC1 (n = 6), MSC2 (n = 6), PBS1 (n = 6), PBS2 (n = 6), and model control (n = 6) groups. C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) were used as normal controls. The MSC1 group was injected with passage 3 通用删除11(英):<u>(P3)</u> HUC-MSCs (1 × 107cells/ml, 0.1 ml/10 g body weight) via the tail vein at 12 weeks. The MSC2 group was injected with P3 HUC-MSCs (1 × 107 cells/ml, 0.1 ml/10 g body weight) via the tail vein at 12 and 16 weeks. The PBS1 group, which was the control for the MSC1 group, was injected with the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as that for P3 HUC-MSCs at 12 weeks. The PBS2 group, which was the control for the MSC2 group, was injected with the same volume of PBS as that for P3 HUC-MSCs at 12 and 16 weeks. All mice were killed at 20 weeks, and serum and ovaries were collected. The ovaries were fixed in 10% formaldehyde.\nSerum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Institute of Bioengineering Co. Ltd. Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nAfter the mice were killed, the ovarian tissues were separated, fixed in formaldehyde fixative, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The ovarian structure was observed under a microscope, and the number of follicles at various stages was noted. The follicular grading criteria were as follows: primordial follicles were defined as oocytes enclosed by a single layer of flat granular cells; primary follicles were defined as oocytes enclosed by a single layer of cubic granular cells; secondary follicles were defined as the appearance of follicular cavities, some forming cumulus, and two layers of follicular membranes; and atretic follicles were defined as a collapsed follicular wall, absent or unclear structure of the egg cell, and a shrunken zona pellucida.\nAfter the mice were killed, the ovarian tissues were separated. Fresh ovarian tissues were embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound (OCT) medium and cut into 5-μm-thick sections for immunohistochemical staining to detect hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Immunohistochemistry was performed by the streptavidin-peroxidase method according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nSPSS 20.0 statistical software (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA) was used for analysis. Data with a normal distribution are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. The t-test was used for comparison between two groups, and one-way analysis of variance was used for comparison among groups. Dunnett's T3 test was used for paired comparisons. A p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\nWe evaluated ovarian function in the mice by measuring the serum concentrations of E2, FSH, and AMH in each experimental group. Serum E2 concentrations (296.75 ± 61.42 vs. 117.73 ± 25.87 ng/dl, p < 0.01) and AMH concentrations (308.41 ± 48.64 vs. 116.75 ± 31.10 ng/dl, p < 0.001) were significantly lower, and FSH concentrations (191.21 ± 76.80 vs. 742.80 ± 100.63 mIU/dl, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the model control group than in the normal control group .\nHematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to observe ovarian structural changes, and we found that the follicles in the normal control group of mice grew actively and were clearly visible. The number of follicles in the model group was fewer than that in the normal control group and disorderly in arrangement with different shapes. The number of follicles in the treatment group was higher than that in the model group, and the level was clear, which was second to the shape of the control group. The numbers of primordial follicles (7.00 ± 1.83 vs. 2.50 ± 1.29, p < 0.01), primary follicles (10.25 ± 1.89 vs. 5.50 ± 1.29, p < 0.01), and secondary follicles (6.50 ± 2.08 vs. 2.00 ± 0.82, p < 0.01) were significantly lower, and the number of atretic follicles (1.00 ± 0.82 vs. 2.75 ± 0.96, p < 0.05) was significantly higher in the model control group than in normal control group .\nSerum E2, FSH, and AMH concentrations were significantly different between the PBS1, MSC1, PBS2, and MSC2 groups . There were no differences in serum concentrations of E2, AMH, or FSH between the PBS1 and PBS2 groups. Serum E2 (p < 0.001) and AMH (p < 0.05) concentrations were significantly higher, and serum FSH concentrations (p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the MSC1 group than those in the PBS1 group. Serum E2 (p < 0.001) and AMH (p < 0.01) concentrations were significantly higher, and serum FSH concentrations (p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the MSC2 group than those in the PBS2 group. There was no significant difference in serum E2 or FSH concentrations between the MSC1 and MSC2 groups.

The numbers of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles were significantly higher (all p < 0.05), and the number of atretic follicles was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the MSC1 group than that in the PBS1 group. The numbers of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles were significantly higher (all p < 0.05), and the number of atretic follicles was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the MSC2 group than that in the PBS2 group. There was no significant difference in the number of primary or secondary follicles between the MSC1 and MSC2 groups. The number of primordial follicles in the MSC2 group was significantly higher than that in the MSC1 group (p < 0.05). Therefore, multiple infusions of HUC-MSCs significantly increased the number of primordial follicles. This finding suggested that multiple infusions of HUC-MSCs were more effective than just one infusion in improving ovarian function.\nOvarian follicular counts in the experimental groups\n删除重复语句：<u>Ovarian follicular counts in the experimental groups</u>\nAbbreviations: MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; PBS, phosphate buffer saline.\nTo determine the mechanisms by which HUC-MSCs could improve ovarian function, we used immunohistochemistry to detect HGF and IGF-1 expression in ovarian tissue of lupus mice. HGF and IGF-1 expression increased after HUC-MSCs transplantation , but this was not significant.\nMost patients with SLE present with abnormal reproductive function.6 However, the specific cause of these abnormalities is unclear. Autoimmune oophoritis caused by SLE could lead to POF.7 Additionally, the use of drugs with gonadal toxicity, such as cyclophosphamide, can cause POF, and thus lead to premature amenorrhea and infertility.8 The chronic inflammatory state of SLE interferes with the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.9 Concomitant antiphospholipid antibody syndrome causes miscarriage, premature delivery, and stillbirth.10 However, the exact mechanism underlying POF in patients with SLE remains unclear, and there have been no reports of in vivo studies on this topic. In this study, the ovarian function of lupus mice was studied to determine whether SLE causes abnormal ovarian function. Our results suggested that patients with SLE had an abnormal ovarian function. However, the sample size was limited, and further studies with larger experimental groups are warranted.\nThe heterogeneity of POF is also reflected by a variety of possible causes, including autoimmunity, drugs, toxins, radiation, and infectious genetic defects.11 Our mouse experiments showed that SLE likely caused ovarian dysfunction, but whether SLE causes POF remains unclear. A cross-sectional study to assess the incidence of POF in 961 female patients with SLE showed that the incidence of POF in patients with SLE who did not receive cyclophosphamide treatment was not significantly lower than that in healthy individuals.12 This finding suggests that the autoimmune response in patients with SLE might not involve the ovary. However, some clinicians have observed that the ovarian reserve function of women with SLE is lower than that in healthy women.13 Patients with SLE of childbearing age who have never received any drug treatment have lower serum AMH concentrations, a higher incidence of abnormal menstruation, an imbalance of the lymphocyte ratio, a lower proportion of CD4+ T lymphocytes and NK cells, and a higher proportion of B cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes than healthy women.14 This finding suggests that abnormal autoimmune function in SLE leads to an impairment of ovarian reserve function. To determine the status of ovarian function in SLE, we studied ovarian function in lupus mice. We assessed ovarian reserve function by measuring serum E2, FSH, and AMH concentrations, and follicles were counted at all stages. E2 is a sex hormone that is synthesized and secreted by the ovaries. A decrease in E2 concentrations indicates a decline in the ovarian secretion of E2. FSH is a gonadotropin secreted by adenohypophysial FSH cells, which can promote the synthesis and secretion of estrogen, maturation of follicles, and ovulation. An increase in FSH concentrations indicates a decline in ovulation function. AMH is secreted by ovarian granulosa cells and promotes the development of gonads. AMH concentrations are not affected by gonadotropins and do not change with the menstrual cycle. Therefore, AMH is considered the most reliable indicator for evaluating ovarian reserve. In our study, E2 and AMH concentrations and the follicular count were significantly lower in lupus mice than in normal mice. FSH concentrations and the number of atretic follicles were significantly higher in lupus mice than in normal mice, which is consistent with clinical reports of ovarian reserve dysfunction in patients with SLE.13,15 Therefore, SLE could cause POF, which could be exacerbated with the use of drugs with gonadal toxicity, such as cyclophosphamide. The ovarian function of patients with SLE should be protected during clinical treatment.\nSeveral methods, including hormone replacement therapy, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog, melatonin supplementation, dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation, and cryopreservation of eggs, embryos, or ovarian tissue, are currently used to treat POF. However, these treatments have poor clinical efficacy and several limitations. Combined hormone replacement therapy is the most common. However, an optimal treatment plan and method of administration have not been established, and estrogen therapy is associated with risks of vaginal atrophy, venous thrombosis, and tumors.16 The use of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog during cyclophosphamide treatment could significantly reduce the incidence of POF in young women with SLE.17 Therefore, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog could be used to prevent POF in premenopausal women with SLE receiving cyclophosphamide treatment.17 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations on family planning, assisted reproduction, pregnancy, and menopause management in female patients with SLE state that a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog should be considered to preserve fertility before using alkylating agents.18 Cryopreservation of eggs, embryos, or ovarian tissues is expensive, technically demanding, and relies on assisted reproductive technology. These fertility preservation methods are mainly suitable for young female patients with reproductive requirements and have limited clinical applications.19,20 Therefore, there is an urgent need for safe and effective methods to treat POF in patients with SLE.\nStem cells are capable of self-replication and multidirectional differentiation. Stem cells can regenerate and repair body tissue, and also regulate the body's immune function via mechanisms such as cytokine secretion. Therefore, stem cell transplantation is considered a therapeutic method to repair damaged ovarian function.21 MSCs are pluripotent stem cells. Compared with embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, MSCs have low immunogenicity and strong immunosuppressive activity. MSCs can restore ovarian function through a variety of mechanisms. These mechanisms include promoting the expression of various cytokines through paracrine pathways, improving the ovarian microenvironment, inhibiting granulosa cell apoptosis, and self-differentiation into estrogen-producing cells.22,23,24,25 The HUC-MSCs used in this study were derived from the umbilical cord tissue of healthy newborns. The umbilical cord is considered medical waste, and thus has the advantages of a noninvasive sampling process, availability, low cost, and no associated ethical issues. HUC-MSCs show strong immune regulation and damage repair functions, stable biological properties, considerable effects in the treatment of autoimmune diseases,26,27 and great clinical application potential in the treatment of POF.28 In this study, HUC-MSC transplantation treatment significantly improved ovarian reserve in lupus mice, increased serum E2 and AMH concentrations, reduced serum FSH concentrations, increased the number of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles, and reduced the number of atretic follicles. The role of MSCs in vivo is not permanent, and previous data have suggested the necessity of repeating MSC infusions after 6 months in patients with refractory lupus.29 We found that the number of primordial follicles in the MSC2 group was significantly higher than that in the MSC1 group. This finding suggests that intermittent MSC therapy might benefit the recovery of ovarian function, and the treatment of POF with MSCs might be dose-dependent. Therefore, our results provide a theoretical basis for the development of novel strategies for the clinical treatment of patients with SLE and ovarian failure, particularly in women of childbearing age who have fertility requirements. In patients with SLE who choose cyclophosphamide therapy, preventive treatment could be considered; however, the preventive effects require extensive further study.\nExperimental and clinical data suggest that MSCs are a promising strategy for severe and refractory systemic lupus erythematosus. Recently, a prospective, 4-year, follow-up study was published, aiming to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of allogeneic MSCT in 87 treatment-resistant patients with SLE.30 This previous study showed that disease activity declined as shown by significant changes in the systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index score, and levels of serum autoantibodies, albumin, and complements. However, the role of stem cells in the treatment of POF is unclear. Human placental MSCs may promote ovarian function by secreting epidermal growth factors.31 HUC-MSCs may improve ovarian endocrine function by modulating ovarian cell apoptosis.32 Moreover, HUC-MSCs might ameliorate POF by regulating the autophagy of ovarian cells and the expression of CD8+CD28-T cells in peripheral blood.33 Additionally, HUC-MSC-derived exosome miR-17-5P may promote the functional recovery of POF induced by cyclophosphamide by regulating the expression of related genes.34 HUC-MSCs can repair ovarian function in a variety of ways, but the main mechanism is not completely clear.\nHGF is an important factor in the environment of follicles and can accelerate the viability of growing follicles and promote the proliferation of ovarian surface epithelium to supplement the damaged areas formed during ovulation. IGF-1 is expressed in granulosa cells and healthy follicles, but cannot be detected in atretic follicles. IGF-1 is an important regulator of granulosa cell proliferation in the early stages of follicular development. The expression of ovarian IGF-1 stimulates the production of progesterone and estradiol and enhances the responsiveness of FSH in granular cells by improving the expression of FSH receptors. Therefore, IGF-1 is an important indicator of ovarian function. We studied the changes in ovarian protein expression before and after HUC-MSC transplantation to identify the mechanisms by which HUC-MSCs could improve ovarian function. IGF-1 and HGF expression in the lupus mouse with POF that received HUC-MSC transplantation slightly increased, but this was not significant. Our result is not consistent with previous studies, which suggested that HUC-MSCs can promote ovarian expression of HGF and IGF-1, resulting in improved ovarian reserve function and preventing ovarian senescence.28 However, how HUC-MSCs act on ovarian tissue to promote IGF-1 and HGF expression requires further study. Additionally, the reason why our result is different to that in previous studies needs to be further investigated.\nThis study suggests that SLE causes abnormal ovarian function, mainly manifesting as changes in ovarian structure and secretory function. This finding requires validation in clinical trials. HUC-MSC transplantation can repair ovarian tissue structure and enhance ovarian secretion function, and repeated HUC-MSC transplantation is required for effective treatment.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the expression profiles of some fertility-related proteins (such as ER and PR) and miRNA in the endometrium with and without endometriosis during the implantation window using Sprague-Dawley rats as an experimental animal model. Due to high incidence of endometriosis-related infertility, it is of importance to investigate endometriosis during the implantation window. The results could provide new insights to understand endometriosis-related infertility and offer basis for improving pregnancy for patients with endometriosis.\nAll animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Permit Number: XHDW-2016-000).\nPathogen-free, sexually mature, Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. (China). The rats included male rats (380 ± 10 g) and nonpregnant female rats (60–70 days old, 200 ± 10 g). The rats were kept at the Laboratory Animal Center of Peking Union Medical College Hospital in cages on bedding (light cycle 14/10 h light/dark) with adequate access to sterilized water and food at 20°C–25°C and relative humidity of 45–60%. The rats were housed five/cage and were adaptively fed for 2–3 days. The estrus cycles of female rats were observed using the vaginal smear method to be about 4–5 days. Twenty female rats were randomized in three groups: endometriosis (n = 7), fat tissue control (n= 6), and normal (n = 7) groups.\nRats in the endometriosis group were observed for three consecutive estrus cycles. On the fourth cycle, a piece of uterine tissue was obtained and transplanted to the peritoneal wall using the autotransplantation method described by Vernon and Wilson通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> but with slight modifications. The rats were anesthetized with 5% pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and were placed in a supine position. After disinfection, a ventral midline incision of about 5 cm was made on the abdomen to open the abdomen cavity. The uterus was isolated, and a piece of uterine tissue of 1 cm was taken from the left horn. The piece was immediately washed with physiologic saline. The excess fat tissue outside the uterine serosa was removed, and the uterine cavity was longitudinally incised and trimmed into two pieces of 5 mm × 5 mm. Those pieces were stitched to the two sides of the abdominal wall near the area enriched with blood vessels. The abdominal wall was closed layer by layer.\nThe rats in the fat tissue control group underwent the same surgery as in the endometriosis group, except that the left uterus was ligatured without taking any tissue. Two pieces of adipose tissue taken from the abdomen were stitched at the same location than the uterine tissue in the endometriosis group. For the normal control group, no surgery was performed.\nOn the 28th day after surgery, the abdomen of the rats was open to observe the growth, invasion, and adhesion of the endometriosis tissue, followed by layer-wise suturing. The transplanted intima was evaluated following the scoring method based on a previous study on rat endometriosis model:通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> 0, no epithelium; 1, poorly preserved epithelium; 2, moderately preserved epithelium; and 3, well-preserved epithelium.\nTen male rats were housed in single-spaced cages individually. The female rats of the three groups were caged at the ratio of 1:1 at 18 o’ clock every night, and trays were placed at the bottom of the cage. At 8:00–9:00 on the next morning, the trays were checked for vaginal plug. Each female rat after mating was subjected to vaginal smear for the presence of sperm. If both a vaginal plug was found in the tray and sperm was found, the rat was considered pregnant and the day was considered as the 1st day of pregnancy (D1). Pregnant rats were no longer subjected to mating. The rats were sacrificed on day 5 of pregnancy (D5; implantation occurs on day 5 in rats),通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> and uterine tissues were obtained and divided into two pieces. One piece was placed in 10% formalin at 4°C for hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. The other piece was rapidly placed into liquid nitrogen at −80°C for gene chip and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).\nUterine tissues were processed routinely for immunohistochemistry. The samples were incubated with ER (1:2000 Beijing Zhongshan Jinqiao Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Beijing, China) and PR (1:10 Beijing Zhongshan Jinqiao Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Beijing, China) for 1–2 h at room temperature. The sample were observed using microscopy.\nImmunohistochemistry was evaluated as follows.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Based on the positively stained cells, cells were divided as weakly positive (+), score 1; moderately positive (++), score 2; and strongly positive (+++), score 3. According to the number of positive cells, cells were divided as weakly positive (+, the total number of positive cells is <25%), moderately positive (++, the total number of positive cells is 25–49%), and strongly positive (+++, the total number of positive cells is >50%). The degree of positivity was evaluated using the following formula: (+)% × 1+ (++)% × 2+ (+++)% × 3. The result of <1.0 was denoted as +, 1.0–1.5 was denoted as ++, and >1.5 was denoted as +++. The samples were randomly observed at 10×.\nTotal RNA was extracted from uterine tissues using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit 删除2：<u>(AM1561, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)</u>, followed by purification and quantification using the Qubit system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). An Agilent 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to check the RNA integrity. The purified RNA was subjected to Affymetrix miRNA expression profile chip, and the miRNA expression profile was analyzed by Bo Ao Bio-Tech (Beijing, China).\nThe Affymetrix miRNA 4.0 chip was applied according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Nanodrop instrument (Affymetrix, Sacramento, CA, USA) was used for quality detection of miRNA extracted from endometrial tissue. Good-quality miRNA from six samples (three from the endometriosis group and three from the normal control group) was subjected to expression profile chip detection.\nFluorescence qPCR was used to validate the expression of miRNAs, with RNA U6 as an internal reference. The conditions of PCR amplification were as follows: 95°C for 15 s; 60°C for 30 s, 40 cycles; 75°C–95°C. All reactions were performed in triplicates. The primers are listed in Table 1. The CT (ΔΔCT) method was used to calculate the fold changes of miRNA expression.\nPrimers for the five selected miRNAs\n删除重复语句：<u>Primers for the five selected miRNAs</u>\nMiRNA: MicroRNA; RT: Reverse transcription; AS: Antisense strand.\nThe Affymetrix® GeneChip® Command Console® software was used to scan the chips, and the images were saved to DAT file for analysis. The DAT file was converted to CEL file, which were preprocessed using the RMA algorithm for background correction, integration of the probe signal to probeset signal, and interwafer normalization removing intersample variation caused by nonbiological factors. Following this, the preprocessed files were subjected to correlation analysis including cluster analysis and principal component analysis to interrogate the similarity and/or difference among various groups. Three or more biological replicates were provided to analyze differentially expressed genes using the SAM (significance analysis of microarray) R package (Beijing, China). Genes were considered differentially expressed when the q-value was ≤5% and the fold change was ≥1.5 or ≤0.5. The target genes of the differentially expressed miRNA were predicted using miRWalk2.0 (PubMed). The function of the predicted target genes was analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).\nAll data were obtained in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Comparison between two groups was performed using the two-tailed Student’s t-test. Comparison among three groups was performed using analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey’s test. Two-sided P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).\nAll rats were alive 28 days after surgery. Three rats were randomly selected from each of endometriosis and fat tissue control groups and were subjected to abdominal cavity opening to observe macroscopically the growth of the implanted tissues. No changes were observed in the fat tissues in the fat tissue control group, whereas the ectopic uterine tissues in the endometriosis group were increased in volume, vascularity, and cystic changes, all three features being 2–3 more important than before surgery 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nThe uterine lining, the myometrium (including the subserosal, vascular, and submucosal layers), and the inner lining of the uterus were observed under light microscopy. Figure 2 shows that the vascular layer of the endometriosis group (averagely 10 mm) was significantly thinner than those of the fat tissue control group (averagely 18 mm) and the normal control group (averagely 18 mm). Atrophy was even observed in the endometriosis group. As shown in Figure 2, in the endometriosis group, the number of endometrial glands was decreased (≤5 in low-magnification fields) and the diameter of the glands (maximum of 5 mm) was reduced. Some glands were hyperplastic (round) with poor body secretion, decidual dysplasia, endometrial epithelial and interstitial disarrangement, and obvious tissue edema. In the fat tissue control group, compared with the endometriosis group, the diameter of endometrial glands (maximum of 10 mm) was larger and the number of endometrial gland was higher (>10 in low-magnification fields). The glandular structure was curved with strong secretion, good decidual growth, and abundant blood vessels. In the normal control group, the diameter of the endometrial gland was the largest (maximum of 10 mm). The glandular structure showed good secretion, good decidua growth, and abundant blood vessels.\nTaken together, these results indicated that the implantation of endometrial tissues in the abdomen of rats led to a successful model of endometriosis, as shown by changes in the uterine cavity. The control groups showed normal uterine cavities.\nThe expression of ER in glandular epithelium was significantly different between the endometriosis and normal control groups (10.95 ± 0.30 vs. 7.82 ± 0.52, t = 4.125, P < 0.001) and between the fat tissue control and normal control groups (10.05 ± 0.45 vs. 7.82 ± 0.52, t = 2.528, P= 0.011), but not between the endometriosis and fat tissue control groups (10.95 ± 0.30 vs. 10.05 ± 0.45, t = 1.756, P= 0.079). The expression of ER in the endometrial stroma was different between the endometriosis and fat tissue control groups (7.58 ± 0.31 vs. 4.33 ± 0.66, t= 3.627, P < 0.001) and between the endometriosis and normal control groups (7.58 ± 0.31 vs. 3.05 ± 0.33, t = 4.816, P < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between the fat tissue control and normal control groups (4.33 ± 0.66 vs. 3.05 ± 0.33, P= 0.189).\nThe expression of the PR in the uterine epithelium was different between the endometriosis and fat tissue control groups (2.52±0.52 vs. 5.5±1.28, t= 2.353, P= 0.019) and between the endometriosis and normal control groups (2.52 ± 0.52 vs. 7.4 ± 0.93, t = 3.539, P < 0.001), but not between the fat tissue control and normal control groups (5.5 ± 1.28 vs. 7.4 ± 0.93, t = 0.970, P= 0.332). The expression of the PR in endometrial stroma was different between the endometriosis and fat tissue control groups (0.78 ± 0.22 vs. 2.30 ± 0.74, t = 2.911, P= 0.004) and between the endometriosis and normal control groups (0.78 ± 0.22 vs. 4.66 ± 0.42, t = 4.847, P < 0.001), but there was no difference between the fat tissue control and normal control groups (2.30 ± 0.74 vs. 4.66 ± 0.42, t = 0.937, P = 0.349). Taken together, these results indicated that endometriosis affected the expression of ER and PR in uterine tissues.\nThe microarray results showed that 475 miRNA transcripts were differentially expressed between the endometriosis and normal control groups, with 127 being upregulated and 348 being downregulated. Table 2 lists the top 20 downregulated miRNAs and top 20 upregulated miRNAs 通用删除8(英):<u>[the heat map is shown in Figure 4a]</u>. In the Circos plot analysis, the downregulated miRNAs were more significant than the upregulated ones 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4b]</u>, and five downregulated miRNAs with a fold change of ≥2 and P ≤ 0.050 were selected for PCR validation, based on previous studies and clinical implication. These results indicated that endometriosis affected miRNA expression in the uterine tissues.\nTop 20 downregulated and 20 upregulated miRNAs in rat uterine tissues in the endometriosis group compared with paired normal control group\n删除重复语句：<u>Top 20 downregulated and 20 upregulated miRNAs in rat uterine tissues in the endometriosis group compared with paired normal control group</u>\nMiRNA: MicroRNA; FC: Fold changes.\nAs shown in Figure 5a, the most common pathways involved by the dysregulated miRNAs were cancer, vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption, morphine addiction, and prostate cancer. Interestingly, the estrogen signaling pathway was also one of the common pathways involved by the dysregulated miRNAs. The GO pathway analysis showed that the dysregulated miRNAs were also involved in metabolic process, development process, cell death, rhythmic process, biological regulation, cellular process, and growth 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5b]</u>. These results indicated that the miRNAs differentially regulated in endometriosis were involved in a number of pathways, some of them potentially playing roles in implantation and fertility.\nThe target genes of five dysregulated miRNAs (rno-miR-29c-3p, rno-miR-34c-5p, rno-miR-141-5p, rno-miR-24-1-5p, and rno-miR-490-5p) were predicted using miRWalk2.0. The target genes were screened using six types of miRNA target genes prediction procedure: miRWalk, miRanda, miRDB, miRMap, miRNAMap, and RNAhybrid, followed by enrichment analysis using GO and KEGG pathways. Results are summarized in Supplemental Table 1.\nDue to the short sequence length of miRNAs, the prediction accuracy was limited, and the identified target genes were involved in a broad range of pathways including embryo implantation, blastocyst formation, decidualization, luteinizing hormone signaling pathway, sperm-egg recognition, estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase, estrogen signaling pathway, ER binding, steroid biosynthesis, steroid hormone receptor binding activity, and steroid dehydrogenase activity 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplemental Table 2]</u>. Nevertheless, these results showed that these five miRNAs were potentially involved in pathways that were part of the reproductive functions.\nRno-miR-29c-3p expression was different between the endometriosis and fat tissue control groups (0.23430 ± 0.03000 vs. 0.31670 ± 0.02000, P = 0.022) and between the endometriosis and normal control groups (0.23430 ± 0.03000 vs. 0.40590 ± 0.05000, P= 0.001), without significant difference between the fat tissue control and normal control groups (0.31670 ± 0.02000 vs. 0.40590 ± 0.05000, P = 0.085). Rno-miR-24-1-5p expression was different between the endometriosis and fat tissue control groups (0.00030 ± 0.00004 vs. 0.00050 ± 0.00003, P = 0.008) and between the endometriosis and normal control groups (0.00030 ± 0.00004 vs. 0.00060 ± 0.00008, P = 0.001), but not between the fat tissue control and normal control groups (0.00050 ± 0.00003 vs. 0.00060 ± 0.00008, P = 0.101). Rno-miR-490-5p expression was different between the endometriosis and fat tissue control groups (0.00080 ± 0.00011 vs. 0.00130 ± 0.00016, P = 0.028) and between the endometriosis and normal control groups (0.00080 ± 0.00011 vs. 0.00130 ± 0.00004, P = 0.001), but not between the fat tissue control and normal control groups (0.00130 ± 0.00016 vs. 0.00130 ± 0.00004, P = 0.366). The expression of rno-miR-34c-5p was different between the endometriosis and fat tissue control groups (0.00180 ± 0.00020 vs. 0.00280 ± 0.00026, P = 0.015), between the endometriosis and normal control groups (0.00180 ± 0.00020 vs. 0.00360 ± 0.00021, P = 0.001), and between the fat tissue control and normal control groups (0.00280 ± 0.00026 vs. 0.00360 ± 0.00021, P = 0.022). Finally, the expression of rno-miR-141-5p was different between the endometriosis and fat tissue control groups (0.08140 ± 0.01164 vs. 0.12670 ± 0.01542, P = 0.011), between the endometriosis and normal control groups (0.08140 ± 0.01164 vs. 0.19240 ± 0.00422, P = 0.002), and between the fat tissue control and normal control groups (0.12670 ± 0.01542 vs. 0.19240 ± 0.00422, P = 0.032). Taken together, these results suggested that these five miRNAs were involved in endometriosis.\nThe associations between the expression of the five miRNAs and the expression of ER (ERα and ERβ) and PR were studied using miRWalk 3.0 and TargetScan. Table 3 shows that the five miRNAs had binding sites on the coding DNA sequence and 3’UTR of ERα, ERβ, and PR.\nRelation between the five selected miRNAs (rno-miR-29c-3p, rno-miR-24-1-5p, rno-miR-141-5p, rno-miR-490-5p, and rno-miR-34c-5p) and steroid hormone receptors predicted by miRWalk 3.删除4：<u>0</u>\n删除重复语句：<u>Relation between the five selected miRNAs (rno-miR-29c-3p, rno-miR-24-1-5p, rno-miR-141-5p, rno-miR-490-5p, and rno-miR-34c-5p) and steroid hormone receptors predicted by miRWalk 3.0</u>\nER: Estrogen receptor; PR: Progesterone receptor; CDS: Coding DNA sequence; UTR: Untranslated region; miRNA: MicroRNA.\nER and PR are involved in endometriosis,通用删除6(英):<u>[2,8,16,18,22]</u> but the involvement of miRNAs is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the correlation between miRNA and ER/PR in the uterine tissues of rats with endometriosis during the implantation window. The results suggested that miRNAs, ER, and PR could play important roles in the implantation period of rats with endometriosis. These miRNAs might play a role in endometrial receptivity in endometriosis.\nThe rat model of autologous endometrial implantation is considered to be representative of human endometriosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> The implantation failure observed in endometriosis is possibly related to the upregulation of ER and downregulation of PR, and the high expression of ER might be closely connected with the inflammatory characteristics of endometriosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,18]</u> The present study suggested that multiple differentially expressed miRNAs were detected in the uterine tissue of rats’ endometriosis during the implantation window. Changes in the expression of particular miRNAs might play a role in the modulation of endometrial receptivity in endometriosis, ultimately resulting in implantation or failure.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>\nSince Buyalos and Agarwal通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> first proposed their concept of endometriosis-related infertility in 2000, the features of endometriosis infertility gathered great attention from medical workers and researchers. Thus, the pregnancy outcomes of patients with endometriosis obviously improved, mainly with the help of preparative drug regimens and assisted reproduction techniques. Nevertheless, the incidence of endometriosis and endometriosis-related infertility did not really change, mainly because the pathogenesis of endometriosis remains poorly understood and because of the complex process of reproduction, on which endometriosis may affect multiple stages. The present study focused on the embryo implantation and endometrial receptivity, more particularly the miRNAs that could be involved.\nIn the present study, the Gene Chip technology was used to detect the miRNA array in the uterus of rats with endometriosis during the WOI. We found that 475 miRNA transcripts were differently expressed between the endometriosis and normal control groups, with 127 being upregulated and 348 being downregulated. Among the dysregulated miRNAs, downregulated genes were more significant than the upregulated. We selected five obviously downregulated miRNAs. According to miRNA target gene prediction tools (miRWalk, miRanda, miRDB, miRMap, miRNAMap, and RNAhybrid), we predicted the target genes of rno-miR-29c-3p, rno-miR-34c-5p, rno-miR-141-5p, rno-miR-24-1-5p, and rno-miR-490-5p.\nMiR-29c-3p is involved in the regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A mRNA translation in endometrial cells, inhibition of VEGF-A protein expression, and angiogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> The present study showed that the expression of miR-29c was increased in eutopic endometrium of baboons and humans with endometriosis, where it might damage the progesterone response by reducing the levels of FKBP4.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Removal of the deep infiltrative endometriosis could reverse the progesterone resistance in women with endometriosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> MiR-29c might inhibit endometriosis by inhibiting endometrial cell proliferation and invasion and by promoting apoptosis.\nJeon et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> showed that the dysregulated expression of miR-24 might be associated with infertility caused by polycystic ovary syndrome. Indeed, miR-24 inhibits the expression of the MYC gene, which is a key factor of multiplication involved in embryo implantation.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> In the present study, rno-miR-24-1-5p was downregulated in the uterus of rats with endometriosis, supporting this role of miR-24. A study of miR-24 transfection showed that the expression of CDKN1b, which is a target gene of miR-24, was suppressed in the process of embryonic development.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> MiR-24 might thus regulate the concentration of estradiol and progesterone during follicular fluid formation.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> The excessive expression of miR-24 might restrain transforming growth factor signaling pathways and inhibit the secretion of estradiol.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> MiRNA-24 is downregulated in the development of porcine embryos; because miR-24 expression was influenced by the culture conditions, miRNA-24 could be used as a quality index for embryos.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> Another study showed that the expression of miR-24 was upregulated in the plasma of patients with severe preeclampsia during the gestational period.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>\nMiR-490-3p may increase CDDP sensitivity in ovarian cancer cells by reducing the expression of ABCC2, indicating that the increase of miR-490-3p might be a potential treatment strategy against cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> In addition, miR-490-3p mRNA expression was lower in endometrial carcinoma tissue than in normal endometrial tissue.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> MiR-490-3p expression negatively regulates the infiltration depth and lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> MiR-490 expression was significantly lower in ovarian cancer and borderline tumors than that of benign tumor.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> Its expression in metastatic ovarian cancer (omentum) was lower than that of primary ovarian cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> It is also negatively associated with FIGO staging and differentiation.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> MiR-490-3p may inhibit tumor occurrence and development of ovarian epithelial carcinoma by regulating its target gene CDK1.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> MiR-490-3p might be associated with the occurrence of drug resistance ovarian cancer. MiR-490 is also obviously abnormally expressed in uterine leiomyoma.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> In the present study, rno-miR-490-3p was downregulated in the uterus of rats with endometriosis.\nIn maternal plasma, the upregulation of miR-34c expression was directly related to good-quality embryos in D3.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> There was a strong correlation between miR-34c expression level in sperm and the results of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment in cattle.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> MiR-34c-positive patients are more likely to have good-quality embryo, implantation, pregnancy, and live birth.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Paternal miR-34c levels may play a role in embryonic development.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> MiR-34c levels might be used as quality index of ICSI outcome in the human sperm.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> MiR-34c participates in the regulation of follicular and two-cell stages of embryonic development in bovine.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> MiR-34c is involved in cervical reconstruction after spontaneous term labor and delivery.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> MiR-34c is important for the first cellular division in the early embryo development.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> Upregulation of miR-34c in breast tumor is associated to downregulation of CYP 1A1 and ERα gene expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>\nA study in mice found that miRNA-141 downregulated the expression of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) and might affect cell proliferation and apoptosis of endometrial cells, playing an important role in embryo implantation.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> A previous study showed that miR-34c and miR-141 were specific to the epithelial cells and they were highly expressed in abdominal endometriosis tissue.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> MiR-141 was upregulated in the placenta of patients with preeclampsia, and miR-141 inhibits the trophoblast cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> MiR-141 was expressed in the placenta and was increased in maternal plasma during pregnancy. MiR-141 was downregulated in endometriosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>\nTaken together, these results suggested that rno-miR-29c-3p, rno-miR-34c-5p, rno-miR-141-5p, rno-miR-24-1-5p, and rno-miR-490-5p played a number of roles in the fertility and reproduction processes, including the endometrial receptivity. Nevertheless, additional studies are still necessary to determine these roles exactly.\nIn this study, rno-miR-34c-5p, rno-miR-141-5p, and ER were upregulated in endometriosis. There might be an intimate relationship between miRNA and ER in rat endometriosis-related infertility during the WOI. MiRNA-141 is one of the miRNA-200 family members, and progesterone can reduce miRNA-141 expression to promote stem-like breast cancer cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> MiRNA-141 may directly regulate PR, which is an important transcription factor for the expansion of mammary gland stem cell.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> The decrease of miR-141 can increase the protein levels of PR and the expression of PR is estrogen dependent on a cellular level.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> MiR-200a/miR-141 might be related to hormone receptor status in endometrial cancer and may affect prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> MiR-34c regulates the reduction of ERα and influences the formation of breast cancer .通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>\nAccording to GO and KEGG-PATHWAY analysis, miRNAs are involved in many relating to fertility activities that molecular functions and biological processes, for example, response to estrogen, response to hormone, luteinizing hormone signaling pathway, ER overload response, ER-nucleus signaling pathway, response to estradiol, response to steroid hormone, protein targeting to ER, ERBB2 signaling, ER-associated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, regulation of ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, estrogen metabolic process, luteinization, ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, estrogen biosynthetic process, steroid metabolic process, steroid hormone secretion, steroid biosynthetic process, steroid catabolic process, steroid hormone receptor binding, steroid hormone binding, hormone binding, estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase activity, steroid dehydrogenase activity, ER binding, steroid hormone receptor activity, steroid binding, and steroid hydroxylase activity. All these pathways may potentially be involved in the regulation of endometrial receptivity, but the exact effects of the miRNAs identified in the present study need to be verified.\nThe results suggested that dysregulation of miRNAs and abnormal expression of ER, and PR could be observed in rats with endometriosis. These changes might influence the embryo implantation of rats with endometriosis during the implantation window.\nSupplementary information is linked to the online version of the paper on the Chinese Medical Journal website.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by a grant from National Nonprofit Industry Scientific Research Fund of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 201502004)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

In this editorial, we focused on recent advancements and challenges of ICIs in patients with NSCLC.\nThe landmark KEYNOTE-024 study demonstrated that pembrolizumab significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS, 10.3 vs. 6.0 months, P < 0.001) and overall survival (OS, 30.0 vs. 14.2 months, P = 0.002) compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with treatmentnaïve advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50% and without EGFR/ALK genetic aberrations.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The KEYNOTE-042 study further demonstrated OS benefits for pembrolizumab monotherapy over chemotherapy in an expanding patient population (OS in PD-L1 TPS ≥1%: 16.7 vs. 12.1 months, P= 0.0018).通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> However, further exploratory subgroup analysis of KEY-NOTE-042 study found no significant benefit in OS in PD-L1 TPS 1-49% population,通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> suggesting that the survival benefits of pembrolizumab monotherapy may mostly come from higher PD-L1 expression population (≥50%).\nICI in combination with chemotherapy represents another promising treatment paradigm 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A444]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5,6,7,8,9]</u> Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the first-line treatment of advanced squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR/ALK genetic aberrations, regardless of PD-L1 expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,8]</u> Camrelizumab plus pemetrexed/carboplatin also demonstrated significant improvements in terms of objective response rate (ORR; 60.0% vs. 39.1%, P < 0.0001), PFS (11.3 vs. 8.3 months, P = 0.0002) and OS (not reached vs. 20.9 months, P = 0.0272) compared with first-line pemetrexed/carboplatin for Chinese patients with nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR/ALK genetic aberrations.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel (IMpower130) or bevacizumab and carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel (IMpower150) also provided PFS and OS superiority over chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,6]</u>\nConcurrent chemoradiotherapy plays a pivotal role in patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. How to prevent metastases and improve the survival is essential for these patients after definitive treatment. Recently, the PACIFIC study demonstrated consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab was effective in patients with locally advanced NSCLC after completed definitive chemoradiotherapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> In PACIFIC study, durvalumab yielded significant improvements in median PFS compared with placebo (17.2 vs. 5.6 months). The updated OS analyses also demonstrated a clinically meaningful OS benefits with consolidation durvalumab vs. placebo (not reached vs. 29.1 months).通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> The findings from PACIFIC study established consolidation durvalumab as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced NSCLC after completed definitive chemoradiotherapy.\nA previous study has revealed that immune suppression may occur at pre-invasive stages of cancer development,通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> suggesting a possible role of ICIs in early-stage NSCLC. A pilot study investigated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab as neoadjuvant therapy in resectable early-stage NSCLC.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> In 21 patients, 20 achieved complete resection with acceptable side-effect profile. Notably, despite only two patients had partial response, 9 of 20 (45%) patients had a major pathologic response (MPR, defined as 10% residual tumor present). Several studies also demonstrated the promising role of neoadjuvant PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors either as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab or chemotherapy. Although the role of MPR as the primary endpoint is questionable, multiple phase III studies are ongoing to evaluate the long-term benefits of neoadjuvant ICI treatment in patients with early-stage, resectable NSCLC. Furthermore, ongoing studies are also evaluating the role of ICI as adjuvant therapy in stage I-IIIA NSCLC after definitive surgical resection.\nDespite rapid advances of ICIs in NSCLC, only a minority of patients respond to single-agent ICI treatment. Even in a highly selected patient population (PD-L1 TPS ≥50%), only 44.8% of patients achieved an objective response when treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Due to the complex immune response process, any single biomarker may not be effective and reproducible enough to predict the benefits of ICIs. For instance, although PD-L1 expression has been widely used for patient selection, several limitations make it an imperfect biomarker, including spatial-temporal heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression, high discordance in PD-L1 expression read on immune cells, and different cutoffs used in each assay. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is another potential biomarker. In CheckMate-227 study, for patients with high TMB (≥10 mutations per megabase), nivolumab plus ipilimumab resulted in longer PFS (7.2 vs. 5.5 months, P < 0.001) and higher ORR (45.3% vs. 26.9%) compared with chemotherapy alone.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> However, the OS benefits were independent of TMB level.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> Recently, a combined biomarker analysis revealed that T-cell-inflamed gene-expression profile, PD-L1 expression, and TMB may help identify patients who are more likely to derive benefits from ICI treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> These findings indicate a direction to pursue predictive biomarkers in further studies. We should integrate multiple biomarkers to better reflect the complex cancer-immune interactions between the tumor, tumor microenvironment and host immunity.\nWith the growing use of ICIs in oncology, awareness and management of irAEs become more important. Unlike the toxicity profiles of classical chemotherapy, irAEs may occur in wide ranges of organs, as consequences of nonspecific and excessive activation of immune system. In a recent meta-analysis involving 16 trials and 6208 patients with advanced NSCLC, the overall incidence of irAEs was 22% for all grades and 4% for grade ≥3 irAEs.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> In addition, fatal irAEs were observed in 0.34% of patients and most deaths (79%) were attributed to pneumonitis.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Therefore, ICIs were generally well-tolerated and the majority of irAEs can be successfully managed with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents based on the guidelines on the management of irAEs.\nAs mentioned above, corticosteroids are the mainstay for the management of irAEs and commonly used in patients with NSCLC in a variety of conditions. Given the immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids and pleiotropic impact on T-cell function, concerns regarding the adverse effect of corticosteroids use on the outcomes of ICIs arose. In a recent retrospective study, baseline corticosteroid use of ≥10 mg of prednisone was associated with inferior clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC when receiving ICIs.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Ricciuti et al通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> further investigated the effect of different reasons for corticosteroids uses (cancer-related palliative reasons vs. cancer-unrelated indications) on outcomes of patients with advanced NSCLC who were administrated with ICIs. Interestingly, patients who received ≥10 mg of prednisone for cancer-related palliative reasons had poorer outcomes than those who received ≥10 mg of prednisone for cancer-unrelated indications or 0 to 10 mg of prednisone. In light of current evidence, necessary corticosteroid uses therefore should not be decreased or discontinued before the start of ICI treatment.\nHyperprogressive disease (HPD) is an atypical response pattern of ICI treatment, characterized by an acceleration of tumor growth kinetics. The incidence of HPD in patients with advanced NSCLC after ICI treatment varied from 9% to 20%.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> In a large-sample cohort including 406 advanced NSCLC patients treated with ICIs, 13.8 % (56/406) of patients experienced HPD, with a dismal OS of only 3.4 months.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Several clinical or genetic factors have been identified to be associated with HPD, including increased age (>65 years), more than two metastatic sites before ICI treatment, a lower frequency of effector/memory subsets of T cells or EGFR alterations, STK11 mutations, MDM2/4 amplifications.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> However, the molecular and immunological bases of HPD remain unclear. A better understanding of the biology of HPD is essential to avoid this detrimental effect of ICI-based therapy on outcomes.\nPseudoprogression represents another atypical response pattern of ICI treatment, which was characterized by initial disease progression but followed by radiologic tumor remission with continued use of ICIs. Pseudoprogression is considered as a result of infiltration of inflammatory cells, hemorrhage, edema or necrosis upon ICI treatment, which lead to accumulated tumor lesions temporarily. This phenomenon was uncommon and found in only 5% of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICIs.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> In clinical practice, the unidimensional immune-related response criteria or the immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria were helpful in distinguishing radiologic pseudoprogression from true progression. Furthermore, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels may be useful for early recognition of pseudoprogression in patients during ICI treatment.\nAs mentioned above, although predictive biomarker could help identify patients who may benefit from ICI treatment, a substantial number of patients still do not respond to ICIs, namely primary resistance. A characterization of hot, altered (immunosuppressed/excluded) and cold tumor phenotypes on the basis of the level and spatial distribution of CD3+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration may help understand the mechanisms of primary resistance.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> Hot tumors, characterized by a high degree of T cell infiltration, represent a tumor phenotype that is suitable for ICI monotherapy or immune-oncology combinations.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> For altered-immunosuppressed immune tumors or altered-excluded immune tumors, varied combination therapies are needed to eliminate the immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment (inhibitory molecules, including trans-forming growth factor-β, interleukin-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor or inhibitory immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells and Treg cells) and facilitate T cells into the center of tumor (combined with T cell trafficking modulators or physical barrier breakers). For cold tumors, the principle of treatment is to turn cold tumors into hot tumors. ICI in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy has been proved effective in patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, how to manage acquired resistance to ICI treatment continues to be a challenge. Varied combinations of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and other checkpoint molecules (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 [CTLA-4], T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 [TIM-3], lymphocyte activation gene-3 [LAG-3]), immune-stimulatory agents, metabolic modulators and other immune modulators are being investigated to overcome resistance to ICI treatment.\nIn the future, a considerable amount of work still needs to be done to maximize the efficacy of ICI treatment and bring about long-term survival in patients with lung cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Most hepatoid adenocarcinomas (HAC) have high AFP expression. HAL lacks effective treatment and has poor prognosis, but early diagnosis and timely treatment can improve long-term survival rate.\nA 63-year-old male patient with no special past medical history or history of hepatitis, presented lumbar soreness, and pain without obvious causes, accompanied by a sensation of skin tear. The pain showed diffuse and wandering location, was intense every afternoon and improved by self-administration of ibuprofen. One month later, the patient found 6 to 7 solitary subcutaneous nodules in the lumbar, back, abdomen, and forechest region, slightly protruding from the body surface with a diameter of about 1 to 2 cm. The nodules could be propelled, with no fusion, rigidity, no fluctuation, partial tenderness, and no local redness and swelling, ulceration or itching. Routine blood test demonstrated that white blood cells 11.07 × 109/L, neutrophils 70.5%, hemoglobin 95 g/L, and platelet 436 × 109/L. Liver and kidney function examination revealed that alanine aminotransferase 68 U/L, total bilirubin 7.8 μmol/L, creatinine 87 μmol/L, and lactate dehydrogenase 359 U/L. Tumor marker detection presented that carcinoembryonic antigen >100 ng/mL, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 41.9 U/mL, CA 72-4 >300 U/mL, and cyfra21-1 31.8 ng/mL.\nThe patient underwent resection of multiple lumbar and dorsal skin masses under local anesthesia. Consultation in the Department of Pathology in Ruijin Hospital suggested poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma by skin biopsy 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. The patient was transferred to our hospital, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed a soft-tissue mass in the apex of the left lung, a nodule in the right upper lobe near the pleura, and increased metabolism, which was suspected as lung cancer. Systemic multiple lymph node enlargement, soft-tissue masses, multiple subcutaneous nodules, and increased metabolism were also found, which were considered as metastatic lesions. The patient died of multiple organ failure due to distant metastases in February 2018. The overall survival was 4 months after initial diagnosis.\nHAC is a special extrahepatic adenocarcinoma with both adenoid and hepatocyte-like differentiated structures, usually occurring in tumors of the digestive tract.

Haninger et al通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> modified Ishikura diagnostic criteria for HAL in 2014. The expression of AFP is not necessary for the diagnosis. Haninger diagnostic criteria fully recognize the presence of HAL without AFP expression and define it as AFP-negative HAL. Common treatments for patients with HAL include surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Patients with diagnosed stage I-II HAL has longer survival after radical resection. Early diagnosis and timely surgery are helpful to improve the overall survival rate.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Patients at stage III-IV usually do not have surgical indications and are suggested to try radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Theoretically, optic nerve decompression reduces intracanalicular pressure and allows for the removal of any impinging bony fragment, assisting in the re-establishment of nerve function. Surgical decompression has been performed by our neurosurgeons with different surgical techniques (endoscopic, transorbital and transcranial approaches). To explore the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic optic nerve decompression in the treatment of TON, we reviewed 11 cases who presented with TON and underwent surgery in the last 5 years at Department of Neurosurgery, Lanzhou University Second Hospital.\nThis study consisted of 11 patients including 8 males and 3 females with the age ranging from 18 to 67 years and an average of 36 years, who had undergone endoscopic optic canal decompression in our department after head injury over 5-year period (Jan.2009-Jan.2015). Preoperative eyesight examinations found no light sensation in 5 cases, light sensation in one, hand movement in two, finger counting in two, and vision acuity of 0.1 in one. Among the 11 patients, eyesight was found declined immediately after injury in 4 patients, while the eyesight in the other 7 patients became gradually worse.\nThe interval between injury and operation was 6 h-30 days. High resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the head and visual evoked potential (VEP) were performed on all patients at initial presentation. Patients were excluded if they did not receive VEP examination before surgery. The endoscopic optic canal decompression was not performed for patients with serious head trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale <8). The results were analyzed using unpaired t-test.\nGeneral anesthesia and controlled hypotension were introduced in all patients throughout optic nerve decompression. The nasal cavity was decongested using xylocaine with adrenaline in a concentration of 1:100,000. The middle turbinate was opened, the ground lamella, posterior ethmoids and then the sphenoid sinus were entered and the sinus ostium was widened in the inferomedial direction and lateral wall bone was removed in the region of the whole optic canal. The nerve was decompressed in the whole segment of the canal and then medicated pack was placed in the nasal cavity, which was removed on the first postoperative day .\nA high dose of antibiotics and methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg per day for 2-3 days) were administered, and 20% glyceryl alcohol was given via intravenous drip, 5 ml/kg each time, 2-3 times a day for dehydration and anti-edema. Adenosine disodium was given via intravenous drip; vitamin B1 and mecobalamin were injected intramuscularly to nourish the cranial nerves.\nVisual acuity is divided into 5 levels: no light sensation, light sensation, hand movement, finger counting, and standard logarithmic visual acuity chart \"visible\". The visual acuity was compared before and after operation. Eyesight improved greater than 2 levels was noted as excellent, 1 level as good, and no obvious improvement as invalid.\nIn this series, traffic accidents were the main cause of head injury involved in 8 cases, fall from height in 2 cases and blunt trauma to the head in 1 case. Right side was involved in 7 cases and left in 4 cases. The vision acuity of 2 cases improved from hand movement to 0.08 and 0.3 after operation. Another case's vision acuity returned to 0.05 compared to light sensation preoperatively. Two cases had finger counting before surgery while they had a vision acuity of 0.4 and light sensation respectively after surgery. However, the other 6 cases did not improve after surgery.\nTwo patients had complications during surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (CSFR) occurred in one case when the sheath of the optic nerve was being incised. CSFR developed in another case when the broken bone fragments were being excised. All the two cases of CSFR were cured by mucosal flap transplantation (the mucosa from excised middle turbinate) and fibrin glue.\nPatients were examined for visual acuity after 3 months post-operatively. Among the 11 patients, the eyesight showed improvement in 5 patients. Among them, the vision acuity improved from hand movement preoperatively to 0.08 and 0.3 postoperatively in 2 cases; the vision acuity returned to light sensation postoperatively from no light sensation preoperatively in 1 case; the vision acuity recovered to 0.4 in 1 case and light sensation in 1 case postoperatively from finger counting preoperatively. However, the other 6 cases did not show their eye sight improvement after operation. Among 6 patients who underwent the surgery within 2 weeks after injury, the eyesight improved in 3 cases; however among 5 patients who underwent the surgery over 2 weeks after injury, only 1 patient's eyesight improved (p < 0.01).\nTON is a serious complication of closed head trauma. The incidence rate is 0.5%-5%.1 It is divided into primary and secondary traumatic optic neuropathy.2 The primary TON is involved in overactive, rupture, contusion, and distort of the optic nerve. This type of injury always leads to immediate blindness. Surgical effect is disappointing.3 The secondary TON may be compromised by nerve edema both within the confines of the bony optic canal and the optic sheath.4 If a patient becomes blind progressively, it is most likely that he has secondary TON and surgery should be performed. Our data showed 4 patients lost eyesight immediately after trauma. Even though the surgery was carried out posttraumatically, none of their eyesight improved eventually. But 7 cases suffered secondary TON, 5 of them got improvement.\nIndications for surgery are mainly dependent upon the results of preoperative VEP scans. A prolonged absolute latency on VEP often suggests visual block physiologically.5 It is generally believed that optic nerve demyelination is induced by edema, ischemia, or hypoxia after trauma. Amplitude reduction often suggests neuroaxonal impairment and diminishment in number. All our cases accepted VEP scan before surgery. VEP could be used as an important reference for preoperative and prognosis evaluation.\nIt is generally considered that the result of optic nerve decompression will not be satisfactory if surgery is performed 2 weeks or more after trauma. Nevertheless, in our study 3 cases underwent surgery 2 weeks posttraumatically, the eyesight got improved in one case. The result was similar to that reported by Thakar et al,6 suggesting that operative time after trauma is only partly affected factor for the therapeutic effect of optic canal decompression.\nIf CSFR is detected intraoperatively, immediate measures should be taken to reduce intracranial pressure. The mucosa should be transplanted into the fistula, and collagen sponge and fibrin glue should be used to fill it in.7 Patients should be confined to bed for 10-14 days after surgery. CSFR was seen in 2 cases in our series and resolved by relevant treatment.\nIt is generally believed that endoscopic optic nerve decompression offers several advantages over other surgical approaches.8 It requires no external incision. There is no orbital retraction during the procedure. The endoscopes could provide an optimal visual field.9 Based on our experience, we believe that endoscopic decompression of the optic canal is a safe and effective therapy for TON. The therapeutic effect relies on adequate decompression of the optic canal and skillful surgical technique.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2016.03.004</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

A subsequent study led by the same group of researchers also identified the SMOC2 gene by search expressed sequence tag sequence databases.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> The SMOC2 gene is localized at chromosome 6q27 and shares 55% of DNA sequence homology with SMOC1.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> SMOC2 has a predicted protein structure that contains similar domains to SMOC1, except for its own unique SMOC domain.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> SMOC1 protein is highly expressed in the ovary, brain, thymus, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and lung, while SMOC2 protein is expressed throughout the human body通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u> and on basement membranes and the extracellular matrix.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,15]</u> Immunohistochemical analysis showed that SMOC1 was expressed in myocytes and as a component of the basement membrane in blood capillaries besides the cell surface.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Furthermore, SMOC1 protein can bind to collagen IV through its EC domain in the basement membrane.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> The SMOC1 interaction with collagen IV indicates that SMOC1 distributes widely in the basement membrane; however, there are few studies to date demonstrating that SMOC1 interacts with SPARC in the same manner. In contrast, SMOC2 protein participates in the assembly of fibrils and is co-localized with fibronectin, the main component of the extracellular matrix.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Thus, SMOC2 acted as a component of fibrils and the characteristic of SMOC2 co-localization with fibronectin may not be typical for the extracellular proteins. SMOC2 has also been identified as a marker of intestinal stem cells,通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> implying that it may have multiple pleiotropic roles.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,16]</u> Taken together, although SMOC1 and SMOC2 shared high DNA sequence similarity, they have distinct functions in the human body.\nAlthough recombinant SMOC proteins can be generated in Escherichia coli,通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> such recombinant SMOC proteins show little biological activity due to the lack of the glycosylation process in vitro. Thus, there is an urgent need to reconstitute functionally glycosylated SMOC proteins for future research.\nA previous study analyzed the expression and regulation of SMOC1 and SMOC2 in fetal gonad/mesonephros complexes and revealed their possible role in the gonad and mesonephros development, that is, SMOC1 expression was elevated at approximately E10.75 in pre-sertoli and pregranulosa cells but was significantly reduced in the Wilms tumor protein 1, splicing factor 1, and friend of GATA2 mutants. At embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), SMOC1 expression was reduced in granulosa cells but persisted in Sertoli cells, indicating a sexually dimorphic requirement in cell lineage differentiation. In contrast, SMOC2 protein was expressed in Leydig cells and mesonephroi and Wnt4 mutant ovaries, while SMOC2 expression required functional Hedgehog signaling in the testes, mesonephroi, and kidneys.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> SMOC1 was also reported to be essential for post-gastrulation development in Xenopus by inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> and for ocular and limb development in both humans and mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Furthermore, during mouse embryogenesis, SMOC1 is expressed in the early mouse embryo at E7 in the entire endodermal basement membrane zone of the embryo proper.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>SMOC1 messenger RNA (mRNA) is expressed in mesenchymal as well as epithelial cells deriving from all three germ layers in the early stages of mouse development. This broad and organ-specific SMOC1 expression underscores SMOC1’s multi-functional roles in mouse embryogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Thomas et al通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> demonstrated in mice that SMOC2 mRNA was present in mid-gestation embryos, particularly in the forelimb, hindlimb, somites, and branchial arches.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,21]</u>SMOC2 mutations were associated with developmental dental defects.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>\nMolecularly, a previous study revealed that SMOCs function through the Smad (homologies to the Caenorhabditis elegans \"small\" worm phenotype and Drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic family of genes) signaling to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling during the joint formation in the linker region.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> Similar to the BMP family and its endogenous antagonists that regulate embryonic organ development,通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> SMOC1 can act as an antagonist of BMP signaling by mediating the MAPK-mediated Smad phosphorylation in the linker region.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> In this regard, SMOC1 was not only a crucial factor to influence post-gastrulation development, but also regulated the formation of anatomic patterning, cell, or tissue fate specification through modulation of its related signaling.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Indeed, the C. elegans SMOC1 homolog acted as a positive modulator of the BMP signaling during development of C. elegans, and human SMOC1 and SMOC2 transgenes could each partially rescue phenotypes of SMOC1 mutants in worms, suggesting that SMOC1 modulation of BMP signaling was evolutionarily conserved.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> The most recent findings of the function and molecular mechanisms of SMOCs action in embryo developments and related diseases are summarized in Table 1.\nRole of SMOCs in embryo development and diseases.\n删除重复语句：<u>Role of SMOCs in embryo development and diseases.</u>\nSMOCs: Secreted modular calcium-binding proteins; WAS: Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome; MLA: Microphthalmia with limb anomalies; PACG: Primary angle-closure glaucoma; BMPs: Bone morphogenetic proteins; MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinas[.\nThe extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), like SPARC, play a key role in the mineralization process of bone.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> As a member of the SPARC protein family, SMOC1 is also highly expressed in the bone and the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Knockdown of SMOC1 expression inhibited osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, whereas SMOC1 overexpression enhanced osteoblast differentiation,通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> indicating that SMOC1 promotes osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. Furthermore, SMOC1 expression peaked on day 1 during post-natal induction of osteoblast differentiation, and gradually decreases in the subsequent 7 days. These studies suggest that SMOC1 positively regulates the early stage of osteoblast differentiation, but it may be not required for the late stage of osteoblast differentiation, similar to other ECM proteins.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Further investigation should focus on bettering our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of SMOC1 action in calcification, such as SMOC1 in the regulation of receptor-mediating signaling. SMOC2 was originally identified in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage通用删除6(英):<u>[5,36]</u> and SMOC2 inhibited osteogenic differentiation and extracellular matrix mineralization through the SMOC2 EC domain.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Ectopic or excessive calcification contributes to diseases like chondrocalcinosis by calcium deposition in the skin or blood vessels. SMOC2 was able to downregulate the mineralization process in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, whereas SMOC-ΔEC, which lacks the EC domain, was unable to inhibit BMP2 signaling and SMOC-EC (the EC domain only)-induced activity of the BMP2 signaling.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> However, knockdown of SMOC2 expression did not affect MC3T3-E1 cell calcification.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> This implies that an increase in SMOC2 levels might result from cell mineralization, rather than as a cause. These findings are contradictory to a previous observation showing that SMOC2 was required for bone development.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> One of the plausible reasons may be because MC3T3-E1 cells were derived from neonatal mouse calvaria and are already committed to calcification,通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> in which SMOC2 may have a less regulatory role.\nAltogether, SMOCs are required for the tissue calcification process, although the regulatory functions of SMOC1 are different from SMOC2. To date, there are few publications that describe the role of other SMOC domains, especially how these unique domains participate in calcification and BMP-related signaling, which warrants further investigation.\nSMOC1 possesses a pro-angiogenic activity and is a target of anti-angiogenic microRNA-223 (miR-223).通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Knockdown of SMOC1 expression significantly attenuated the sprouting of endothelial cells in the aortic rings and delayed retinal angiogenesis in SMOC1+/－ mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> The inhibitory effect of SMOC1 silencing on angiogenesis was associated with upregulation of endoglin expression, which is an endothelium-specific type III auxiliary receptor in the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor family and can induce Smad2 phosphorylation. Mouse endothelial cells were able to secrete SMOC1 protein to inhibit expression of the activin-like kinase (ALK) 5 and promote TGF-β signaling and ALK1 activation, resulting in endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Furthermore, hypoxia can stimulate transcription of SMOC1 mRNA in human endothelial cells by down-regulation of miR-223 expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>SMOC2 overexpression acts in parallel synergize with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor to stimulate DNA synthesis and the formation of endothelial cell network-like structures, whereas SMOC1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment inhibited endothelial cell network formation and proliferation. These in vitro data were confirmed in mice with sub-dermal implantation of Matrigel plugs containing SMOC2 cDNA adenovirus.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> Similarly, SMOC2 can promote cell migration, angiogenesis, and migration beyond the enhancement of the neointima formation.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Accordingly, SMOC2 may promote the pathological progression of endometriosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>\nAlthough there is high sequence similarity between SMOC and SPARC, these proteins have opposing effects on angiogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> For example, SPARC was able to inhibit gastric cancer angiogenesis by attenuating expression of VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase 7.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> The functional balance between the SMOCs and SPARC ultimately determines their effects on endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and other pathogenic processes. Further studies should focus on the molecular mechanisms by which SMOCs regulate angiogenesis.\nIn addition, a previous study reports that the smooth muscle associated protein 2 (SMAP2), originally isolated from human aortic 3V cDNA library, showed a similarity to SMOC2.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> The SMAP2 protein contains two thyroglobulin type-1 (Tg1) domains, two EF-hand calcium-binding domains, and a putative signal sequence domain. The Tg1 domain can regulate proteolysis.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> SMAP2 mRNA transcripts are detected predominantly in the aorta, skeletal muscle and heart, ovary, testis, stomach, small intestine and colon, thyroid gland, mammary gland, and prostate. SMAP2 expression was upregulated by 5.4 fold at 7 days post-surgery in a rat model of intraluminal balloon injury in the right carotid artery. Its expression was activated at day 3 and remained up to 14 days after surgery, suggesting that SMAP2 may be closely related to the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cell after vascular injury.\nSPARC can directly bind to various growth factors, including the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) ,通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> VEGF,通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> TGF-β,通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> or fibroblast growth factor 2通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> to inhibit receptor-mediated signaling. In contrast, SPARC deficiency promoted the proliferation of mesangial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> Similarly, high levels of SMOC2 expression were detected in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle in fibroblasts but these were reduced during the process of serum-stimulated cell cycle progression, suggesting that SMOC2 inhibits cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in fibroblasts.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> In contrast, serum stimulation did not change SMOC1 expression in fibroblasts Swiss 3T3. These data suggest that both SMOC1 and SMOC2 have differing roles in the regulation of the cell cycle although the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Furthermore, SMOC2 is required for growth factor-induced mitogenesis, especially for TGF-β .通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> SMOC2 ablation abrogated cyclin D1 levels in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in 3T3 cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Interestingly, SMOC2 ablation also reduced PDGF-induced DNA synthesis by 46% in cytomegalovirus-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfected cells, while SMOC2 ablation only decreases the PDGF-induced DNA synthesis by 4% in cyclin D1-overexpressing Swiss 3T3 cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> These studies suggest that cyclin-D1-overexpressing cells had better responses to growth factor(s), independent of SMOC2. Actually, SMOC2 deficiency did not significantly affect the PDGF-mediated PDGFβR phosphorylation, regardless of PDGF addition,通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> or the PDGF-induced MAPK and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling and DNA synthesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Hence, SMOC2 may not be required for the PDGFβR signaling. SMOC2 is required for the effective activation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK). However, the precise mechanisms by which SMOC2 regulates ILK activation remain to be clarified. Defective ILK signaling due to the SMOC2 deficiency could retard the G1/S transition of the cell cycle and may be involved in SMOC2-regulated cyclin D1 expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\nThe EC domain of SMOC proteins is an autonomously folding domain and functions to promote the adhesion of skin HaCaT cells in a heparin sulfate-dependent manner.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> Downregulation of SMOC1 expression reduces endothelial cell adhesion to collagen I, laminin-III, and/or Matrigel.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> The EC domain of SMOC1 contains unique basic amino acids, the glycosaminoglycan-binding site, which are not present in other SPARC family proteins.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> However, heparin sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface do not guarantee the successful binding of SMOCs to cell adhesion molecules because HaCaT cells do not adhere to the EC domain of SMOC1 in the presence of a chelating reagent, even if the recombinant EC domain can maintain such a heparin-binding activity.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> SMOC2, unlike SMOC1, does not promote adhesion of HaCaT cells, although there are a high sequence similarity of heparinbinding sites between SMOC1 and SMOC2.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> Maier et al通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> previously reported that SMOC2 was able to selectively promote the adhesion of epidermal cells, dependent on the EC domain of SMOC2 and the integrins αvβ6 and αvβ1, but did not affect fibroblast adhesion. Moreover, the EC domain of SMOC2 can induce cell migration and wound healing.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> In basement membranes, there are many heparin sulfate proteoglycans, such as collagen XVIII and perlecan. There is a need for further investigation as to how SMOCs interact with them and regulate cell adhesion and migration.\nThus far, we reviewed and discussed SMOCs and their function in cells and tissues. Some studies have also revealed the alteration of SMOC1 and SMOC2 functions in the pathogenesis and progression of human diseases. Generally, alterations of SMOC1 and SMOC2 can occur at the genetic, transcriptional, and post-translational levels and the aberrant SMOC1 and SMOC2 expression can lead to the development of human diseases. We discuss them in more detail below.\nSMOC1 homozygosity mapping and subsequent targeted mutation analysis revealed that SMOC1 mutations were associated with ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), also known as Waardenburg Anophthalmia syndrome. OAS is defined by a combination of eye malformations, most commonly bilateral anophthalmia, with post-axial oligosyndactyly.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> SMOC1 mutations include nonsense, frame-shift, and missense mutations. The latter mutations occurred in the second Tg1 domain of the protein, while the targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mutation of Smoc1 [Smoc1(tm1a)] results in a reduction of SMOC1 mRNA levels to 10% of the wild-type (WT) SMOC1 levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> A recent study also reported a novel homozygous missense SMOC1 mutation (c.812G>A; p.Cys271Tyr) in a family of patients with Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>\nPersistent chronic inflammation can lead to tissue fibrosis. A previous study showed that treatment of rat mesangial cells with interleukin 1 beta induced nitric oxide (NO) production, but reduced SMOC1 expression in rat mesangial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u> The blockade of the inducible nitric oxide synthases activity upregulates SMOC1 expression to enhance rat glomerular inflammation, which is accompanied by an increase in the deposition of fibrin in the glomeruli in a rat model of anti-Thy1.1-induced chronic glomerulonephritis.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> Furthermore, knockdown of SMOC1 expression using SMOC1 siRNA decreased TGF-β expression and activity of the TGF-β signaling, which in turn reduced Smad activation and its target gene expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> Interestingly, NO was able to inhibit SMOC1 expression and attenuate TGF-β-mediated signaling.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> However, the specific mechanisms underlying the regulation of NO on SMOC1 expression remains unclear. SMOC2 has similar biological effects on the pathological process of fibrosis. For example, Gerarduzzi et al通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> demonstrated that SMOC2 is a key regulator of the pathological secretome in a damaged kidney and that SMOC2 promoted kidney fibrosis. In contrast, neutralization of SMOC2 attenuated the TGF-β-induced fibrosis in NIH 3T3 cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Intriguingly, SMOC2 overexpression was able to induce mouse kidney fibrosis and deteriorated inflammation-induced kidney fibrosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>\nBleomycin, a cytotoxic anti-cancer agent, can inhibit DNA synthesis but induce reactive oxygen species production, which may also cause pulmonary fibrosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> A recent study showed that reduction of SMOC2 expression was able to attenuate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis through inhibition of TGF-β signaling.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Moreover, SMOC2 suppression also attenuated the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling and inflammatory responses.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Besides, SMOC2 deficiency can ablate the bleomycin-induced macrophage activation and neutrophil infiltration in vivo and in vitro.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> The pathological score, collagen accumulation, and pulmonary fibrosis degrees were all lower in SMOC2－/－ mice than in WT mice after bleomycin treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Similarly, the levels of NF-κB phosphorylation and TGF-β1 expression in the lung were also significantly lower in the SMOC2－/－ mice than in SMOC2 WT mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> These data suggest that SMOC2 participates in the pathogenic process of pulmonary fibrosis and that further study could lead to the use of SMOC2 as a potential therapeutic target to treat pulmonary fibrosis. Also, SMOC2 overexpression exacerbated the fibrotic process, whereas knockdown of SMOC2 expression attenuated TGF-β1-mediated fibrosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> These data indicate that SMOC2 could be a potential regulator of TGF-β1 signaling and fibrosis.\nHowever, a previous study of indomethacin and retinoic acid (RA) in the modification of mouse intestinal inflammation and fibrosis revealed that indomethacin/2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) enhanced and RA reduced inflammation, tissue destruction, and fibrosis in a mouse model of TNBS-induced intestinal fibrosis, in which SPARC expression was inversely associated with fibrosis, but not with inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u> This study may indicate the differential role of SMOCs vs. SPARC in the regulation of tissue fibrosis.\nIt is well known that interactions between malignant cells and the extracellular milieu are critical for cancer development and progression.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> SPARC, as a set of ECM proteins, can affect stromal and desmoplastic responses to tumor cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> The role of SPARC in the regulation of ECM production could make it a candidate conditioner of tumors.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> Consistent with this speculation, SPARC deficiency promoted tumor growth in mice,通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u> and SMOCs also regulate malignant cell proliferation.通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> At the chromosome level, the SMOC2 gene region contains several tumor suppressor genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[57,58]</u> Previous studies revealed that SMOC2 expression was downregulated in gall bladder carcinoma通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> and advanced breast cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u> In contrast, levels of SMOC2 mRNA were upregulated by 36.55 fold in metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tissues.通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> SMOC2 modulated keratinocyte adhesion through binding to integrins通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> and the latter is important in the regulation of cell anoikis resistance and maintenance of cancer stem cell phenotypes.通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63]</u> By targeting a cancer stem cell signature gene, SMOC2 was able to overcome chemoresistance and inhibit proliferation of endometrial carcinoma cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> Furthermore, SMOC1 was thought to be a cancer-related protein related to tenascin-C expression, which is an ECM protein and is highly expressed in a large variety of human cancers.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> SMOC1 expression was upregulated in cancer tissues, such as oligodendrogliomas and astrocytic tumors.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> SMOC1 was able to inhibit tenascin-C-induced migration of glioma U87 cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> In this section, we further discuss the role of SMOCs in the regulation of development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma.\nTo date, the role of SMOC2 on HCC development and progression is controversial. For instance, SMOC2 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and upregulated SMOC2 expression induced expression of the MAPK/extracellular regulated protein kinases and AKT signaling.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Moreover, upregulated SMOC2 expression was able to promote cell cycle progression and tumor cell proliferation through an increase in cyclin D1 expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Hence, SMOC2 may be further studied as a potential therapeutic target to treat HCC clinically. In contrast, Huang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> reported that SMOC2 expression was downregulated in HCC tissues and SMOC2 expression was associated with a favorable overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with HCC. The further experimental study indicated that SMOC2 overexpression suppressed HCC cell migration, proliferation, and cell cycle progression.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> Thus, future study is needed to clarify the role of SMOC2 in HCC; however, to date, there is no single study of SMOC1 in HCC reported in the literature.\nSMOCs were shown to be colorectal cancer biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u> For example, recent studies revealed that high levels of SMOC2 and leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) expression were observed in human colorectal cancer tissues通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> and that SMOC2 overexpression was associated with the potent metastatic capacity of Lgr5-upregulated colorectal cancer cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u> Elevated SMOC2 expression was detected in the invasive front of tumor tissues and SMOC2 expression is indispensable for L1-mediated invasion of colorectal cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> In parallel, SMOC2 overexpression was able to induce colorectal cancer motility and liver metastasis and the oncogenic effect of SMOC2 was associated with modulation of ILK activity, whereas treatment of colorectal cancer cells with QLT0267, a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor or knockdown of ILK expression reduced the SMOC2-mediated oncogenic effects.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u>\nThe \"serrated neoplasia pathway\" was considered a route of colorectal cancer development,通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> and sessile serrated adenoma/hyperplastic polyps and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) are different premalignant lesions in colorectal cancer development. Methylation of the SMOC1 gene gradually increased during TSA development, but rarely occurred in sessile serrated adenoma/hyperplastic polyps.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> Consistent with the elevated SMOC1 gene methylation, SMOC1 expression was downregulated in TSAs, but not in sessile serrated adenoma/hyperplastic polyps.通用删除6(英):<u>[70]</u> Therefore, SMOC1 might serve as a diagnostic marker for serrated lesions.\nLung adenocarcinoma is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the world and lung cancer metastasis usually leads to a poor prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u> Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer metastasis remain to be defined. SMOC2 has been identified as a pro-metastatic matricellular protein and knockdown of SMOC2 expression inhibited lung cancer metastasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[72]</u> Brady et al通用删除6(英):<u>[72]</u> showed that expression of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 2 (Arntl2), a paralog of the circadian transcription factor Arntl,通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u> was upregulated in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and associated with poor prognosis. Another study revealed that the prometastatic effects of Arntl2 are attributed to a ten-fold increase in SMOC2 expression and that knockdown of Arntl2 expression significantly reduced SMOC2 expression in metastatic lung cancer cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[72]</u> Their additional data showed that both Arntl2 and Clock were able to bind to the proximal SMOC2 gene promoter, implying that both Arntl2 and Clock can directly regulate SMOC2 expression in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.通用删除6(英):<u>[74,75]</u> Given that there are multiple extracellular proteins involved in metastasis of different human cancers,通用删除6(英):<u>[74,75]</u> further studies are needed to better understand how these genes interact with SMOCs to impact lung cancer metastasis.\nSMOC1 and SMOC2 are ECM proteins of the SPARC family with differential and unique characteristics in tissue distribution and cell functions. SMOC1 was necessary for the early stage of osteoblast differentiation, while SMOC2 inhibited osteoblast differentiation.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,35]</u> SMOC proteins were able to promote angiogenesis, fibrosis, and cell motility and adhesion. The basic SMOCs functions and signaling are summarized in Figure 1. It should be noted that the pro-angiogenic effects of SMOCs oppose those of SPARC and the imbalance between the SMOCs and SPARC might determine the outcome and potential pathological changes during disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Thus, although the EC domain of SMOCs can regulate the mineralization process and cell attachment, functions of other SMOC protein domains, especially their unique domains, require further investigation. Furthermore, the regulatory effect of SMOC2 on cell adhesion depends on the context of individual cell types.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> The mechanisms by which SMOCs as the soluble matrix proteins enter into their targeted cells and bind to their related receptor(s) to regulate cell signaling remain unstudied. Besides, the molecular mechanisms underlying how SMOCs regulate the cell cycle, interact with growth factors, and contribute to cancer development and progression as well as regulate embryonic development should be clarified in future research.\nThis study was supported in part by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2018YFC1002600)</u>, the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2017A070701013, No. 2017030314109, and No. 2019B020230003)</u>, and the Guangdong Peak Project 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. DFJH201802)</u>.\nNone.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

In 2001, the landmark Leuven study通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> demonstrated that tight glycemic control (TGC) reduced mortality in the surgical ICU. Nevertheless, another study performed by the same author in medical ICU failed to find any significant effect of TGC on overall mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> However, the NICE-SUGAR study通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> in 2009 reported an increase in mortality for the TGC group. One possible explanation for the conflicting results might be that TGC in critically ill patients was associated with a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia (up to 28.6%) compared with conventional glycemic control.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6,9,10,11]</u> In addition, there was considerable variability in what constituted \"conventional glycemic control.\" For example, in the studies by van den Berghe et al. the targeted blood glucose (BG) level in conventional group was 10.0–11.1 mmol/L,通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> whereas it was <10.0 mmol/L in the NICE-SUGAR study.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> In consequence, these results called for a heightened focus on improving the quality and safety of BG management in the ICU.\nNumerous BG control protocols have been developed to achieve TGC. Among these, the enhanced Model Predictive Control (eMPC) algorithm proved to be efficient and safe in several multicenter clinical studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13,14,15,16]</u> Space Glucose Control (SGC) is a CE-certified device installed with the eMPC algorithm, and the first device on the market available for clinical medical use.\nAlthough the effectiveness of SGC was verified by Amrein et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> six of forty patients experienced hypoglycemia (<3.3 mmol/L) and one had severe hypoglycemia (<2.2 mmol/L). Many randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that it is difficult to achieve low BG targets for TGC without increasing the risk of severe hypoglycemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6,9,10]</u> Based on these reports, current guidelines advocate less strict glycemic control in the setting of critical illness. To prevent the high risk of hypoglycemia and comply with the current recommendations, we have implemented the BG target range of 5.8–8.9 mmol/L in our ICU.\nThe objective of this randomized controlled study was to investigate the efficacy of the SGC system, which has been customized to our BG target range, for glycemic control in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation through comparison with routine glucose management protocol.\nThe protocol was approved by the Peking Union Medical College Hospital Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from every patient or the next-of-kin when the patient was unable to provide consent before any trial-related activities. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was registered at the Clinical Trials Database (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT02491346).\nThe study was designed as a randomized controlled nonblind clinical trial at the 15-bed medical ICU in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients admitted to the ICU were eligible for the trial if they had at least one blood sugar measurement of ≥9.0 mmol/L plus the following: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> age ≥18 years; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> mechanical ventilation; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> predicted ICU length of stay ≥72 h. Patients were excluded if they were admitted because of diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar state, pregnant, allergic to insulin, or moribund and likely to die within 24 h.\nPatients enrolled in the trial were randomized to the SGC group or the control group (routine glucose management of the ICU). The BG target range for both groups was 5.8–8.9 mmol/L. Randomization was accomplished through computerized randomization table by a specialized statistician.\nThe SGC system is run at the bedside by the ICU nursing staff. It includes three infusion pumps and a touch screen, which are interconnected through the Space station. Two of the pumps are for enteral and parenteral nutrition (Infusomat® Space; B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) and the other is for insulin (Perfusor® Space; B. Braun). Data communication between the pumps can be conducted through the touch screen, which is the central user interface. The SGC is implemented with the eMPC algorithm to perform blood management. As described previously,通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18]</u> glucose measurement, insulin perfusion rate, and infusion rate of specific enteral and parenteral nutrition are the input variables for the SGC. The insulin perfusion rate and time of the next glucose sample (between 30 and 240 min) are the outputs. The responsible nurse must confirm the advised insulin dose rate, which is then set automatically at the pump. Changes in enteral or parenteral nutrition are communicated directly to the eMPC by the corresponding pumps that are attached to the SGC, which automatically generates an insulin dose that requires confirmation by the nursing staff. The system can store and display all data on treatment and trends of all relevant information on the touch screen.\nIn the current study, insulin adjustment in the SGC group was guided by the SGC and carried out by the ICU nursing staff under the direction of ICU physicians. All participating nurses were instructed on the principle of the eMPC algorithm and trained at the bedside in handling the SGC system before the trial began. In the control group, the responsible physician, who had been trained extensively with regards to the BG management protocol adopted in our department, aimed to maintain BG within the target range. The BG management protocol was a modification of the Yale insulin infusion protocol.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> In brief, insulin was administered by the physician via intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection if BG level exceeded 9.0 mmol/L, and was titrated to maintain BG in the range of 5.8–8.9 mmol/L. Glycemic monitoring was performed via BG measurements at 1-4 h intervals, which should be shortened in case of severe glucose abnormality.\nBG was measured with a glucometer using the Accu-Chek Performa test strip (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Capillary BG was sampled from the patients’ fingertips. In patients with shock or receiving vasopressors, we recommended that blood samples should be withdrawn from an arterial line to measure BG. Insulin (40 U in 40 ml 0.9% sodium chloride; Wanbang Biopharmaceuticals, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China) was infused intravenously using a standard syringe of the ICU (Perfusor® Space). In the control group, insulin was administrated through intermittent subcutaneous or intravenous infusion according to the discretion of the responsible physicians.\nAll trial-related treatments and observations were continued for 72 h, or until discharge from the ICU, or death. Other insulin formulations or oral antidiabetic drugs were not allowed during this trial. If the patient was discharged to a general ward, BG was controlled according to the physician’s discretion. Feeding was prescribed in accordance with our routine departmental practice. We recommended that patients should receive adequate caloric and glucose intake, such as 200–300 g/day glucose for those without enteral or parenteral nutrition; enteral nutrition should be given as soon as possible; and patients should receive 25–35 kcal·kg-1·day-1 energy intakes for nutrition. For those patients treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT), the daily intake of carbohydrates was 3–5 g/kg, as recommended by the European Society of Parenteral and Enternal Nutrition Guidelines.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>\nPatients’ demographic and clinical information was collected prospectively, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, baseline BG level, history of diabetes, RRT, vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS)通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> for patients treated with vasopressors, daily steroid dose expressed as prednisone equivalent, carbohydrate content of enteral and parenteral nutrition, and main diagnostic category for ICU.\nThe primary outcome was the percentage of time in BG target range during the 72-h study period. The secondary outcomes were average glycemia level for the entire study; incidence of severe hypoglycemia (≤2.2 mmol/L); incidence of moderate hypoglycemia (2.3–3.3 mmol/L); percentage of time between 3.4 and 5.7 mmol/L with moderate risk of hypoglycemia; percentage of time >9.0 mmol/L, indicating hyperglycemia; standard deviation (SD) of mean BG, indicating variability; time to first BG measurement in target range; insulin dose; and sampling interval, indicating workload. The percentage of time in the BG target range was defined as the number of measurements in the target range in each patient.\nWe calculated the sample size as 54 patients (27 per group) to detect a 20% difference in the time with target range, assuming an SD of 22% for each group, two-tailed Type 1 error of 0.05, and power of 90%.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,17,22,23]</u> In view of possible consent withdrawal and data missing during the trial, we finally planned to enroll 70 patients. SAS statistical software package  was used for sample estimation.\nCategorical variables were reported as absolute frequencies. Numerical data were reported as the mean±standard deviation (SD) if not otherwise indicated. Comparison of categorical data was made via Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test, and differences in continuous data were evaluated by Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. For the paired data from average blood values every 4 h, a paired t-test was used for comparison. For data in the same group at different times, repeated measures analysis of variance was performed. For BG control outcomes with significant difference between the two groups, multivariate linear regression was performed to determine if the type of intervention remained as an independent predictor after controlled for confounding factors, including age, BMI, APACHE II, baseline BG level, insulin dose, carbohydrate administration, sampling interval, time to target range, and vasopressor or steroid treatment. The method by which the independent variables entered the regression model was \"enter.\" A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and was presented as two-tailed. SPSS Statistics version 19.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis.\nBetween December 22, 2014 and June 20, 2015, 262 patients were admitted and screened for eligibility of the study. After exclusion of 183 patients, 79 patients were recruited and randomized into the study: Forty allocated to the SGC group and 39 to the control group. Data of 9 patients were censored and distributed equally in the 2 intervention groups (P = 0.737). Finally, 36 patients in the SGC group and 34 in the control group were analyzed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were no differences in age, gender, history of diabetes, BMI, baseline BG level, time from ICU admission to BG control, glucocorticoid use, vasopressors, or RRT, while the APACHE II score in the SGC group was significantly higher than in the control group (23.6±5.8 vs. 18.5±6.6, P = 0.001). The two groups did not differ significantly with regards to the primary admission diagnosis, which included pulmonary (58.6%), central nervous system (24.3%), infectious (10.0%), cardiovascular (4.3%), and other disorders (2.9%).\nPatient baseline demographic and clinical characteristics\n删除重复语句：<u>Patient baseline demographic and clinical characteristics</u>\nData are presented as means ± SD or n (%) as noted. *t values, †χ2 values.

Compared with the control group, patients in the SGC group had significantly lower average BG (7.8±0.7 vs. 9.1±1.6 mmol/L, P < 0.001), shorter time to reach target glucose level (2.5±2.9 vs. 12.1±15.3 h, P = 0.001), lower percentage of time >9.0 mmol/L (21±14% vs. 42±25%, P < 0.001), and higher percentage of time between 3.3 and 5.7 mmol/L (10±6% vs. 5±9%, P = 0.014). However, there were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia (<2.2 mmol/L) in either group, and only one episode of moderate hypoglycemia (2.2–3.3 mmol/L) in each group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>. The two groups showed no significant difference in BG variability, as shown by SD of mean BG (1.8 ± 0.7 vs. 2.1 ± 1.1 mmol/L, P = 0.159) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.\nThe daily insulin dose was significantly higher in the SGC group than the control group (59.8 ± 39.3 vs. 28.4 ± 36.7 U, P = 0.001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>. The average sampling interval was notably shorter in the SGC group than the control group (2.0 ± 0.5 h vs. 3.7 ± 0.5 h, P < 0.001). The two groups did not differ significantly in daily energy supplied by enteral and parenteral nutrition 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>.\nTwenty-four (66.7%) patients in the SGC group and 16 (47.1%) in the control group received vasopressors during the study, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.098).

In that case, moderate hypoglycemia (2.8 mmol/L) developed during continuous infusion of insulin at a dose of 5.6 U/h. The treating physician prescribed an intravenous bolus of 10 g glucose, and increased delivery of enteral nutrition from 30 to 80 kcal/h. The responsible nurse overruled the SGC recommendation (i.e. adjust the insulin dose to 4 U/h), and reduced the insulin dose to 2 U/h after discussion with the treating physician.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SGC system with a BG target of 5.8–8.9 mmol/L in critically patients with mechanical ventilation. Compared with the routine glucose management, the SGC system significantly improved glycemic control, as suggested by a longer time within the target range, a shorter time to achieve the BG target, a lower mean BG concentration, and no evidence of increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, at the expense of increased workload for medical staff.\nThe time within target range in the SGC group in our study was inferior to those reported by Amrein et al. who conducted the only two studies up to now to investigate the performance of the SGC system in ICU settings.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,24]</u> These authors reported that the time within target range was 83.4% and 93.1%, respectively. ICU staffs in the above two studies had intensive hands-on simulated training and long-term routine use of branded pumps, and ICU nurses attended one-on-one training on virtual patients before enrolment of the first patient. In comparison, the training in our study was less extensive. In addition, the average study period was 6–7 days in the studies of Amrein et al. which was significantly longer than 3 days in our study. As shown in our study, the time within target range steadily increased from day 1 to day 3, indicating a process of self-learning through integration of previous data and treatment response. Other possible reasons for the difference in time within target range might include the lack of control group, and the different target range (default of 4.4–8.3 mmol/L vs. customized 5.8–8.9 mmol/L).\nInterestingly, although the SGC system was developed based on eMPC algorithm, studies using the former system, including our study, observed a significantly longer time within target range, compared with 46.0–66.1% as reported in studies using the eMPC algorithm.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16,23,25]</u> Previous studies examining the efficacy of the eMPC algorithm used a laptop, thus requiring manual input of data such as BG and calorie intake, which was prone to errors. In comparison, the SGC system had the advantage of automatic integration of a variety of confounders, e.g. insulin dose, and nutritional delivery.\nWe observed no cases of severe hypoglycemia, as well as only two cases of moderate hypoglycemia (one in each group), which was comparable to other studies of the eMPC and SGC system.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16,17,23,24]</u> However, it was noteworthy that the current study did not have adequate power to detect any difference in severe/moderate hypoglycemia between the two groups. Further studies with a larger sample size are required to investigate whether a higher BG target range is associated with a better safety profile compared with traditional BG target range, i.e. 4.4–6.1 mmol/L.\nIn the current study, the average sampling interval in the SGC group was similar to previous reports about eMPC or SGC (1.5-2.3 h),通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16,17,23,25]</u> and almost half of that in the routine management group. This indicated a significant increase of workload. The main difference between the eMPC and other protocols is the nonfixed sampling interval of the eMPC algorithm, which provides unequivocal instructions regarding the time to next measurement. In reality, individual requests for glucose measurements can be easily postponed because of the fast pace of work in the ICU. A clear indication of time interval by the time counter of the eMPC can resolve the problem to some extent.\nHowever, more frequent BG measurements in the SGC group might inevitably be associated with Hawthorne effect, meaning more care to the patients, and, therefore, longer time within target range. Multivariate linear regression analysis in all enrolled patients, as well as patients in the SGC group, found that longer sampling interval was associated with longer time within target range, which was contrary to the previous consensus通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> and reports.通用删除6(英):<u>[27,28]</u> Although inconclusive, these findings suggested that sampling interval was more affected by severity of acute illness, but not positively correlated with better glucose control.\nWe acknowledge the following limitations to our study. First, the original calculated sample size was designed to compare the difference in time within target range between two groups. However, the observed difference between the two groups (17%) was lower than predicted 20%. Furthermore, as discussed above, the current study was not designed to detect difference in safety profile, although we observed nonsignificant lower glycemic variability in the SGC group. Second, the current study was conducted in nonblinding approach due to feasibility issues, therefore prone to Hawthorne effect. However, the analyst was not involved in the conduct of the study, which might reduce the selection bias. Third, our results might only be applicable to population with similar characteristics. It is therefore important to note that the enrolled population in this study exclusively included mechanically ventilated patients with expected ICU length of stay for >72-h. Thus, many postsurgical patients and individuals without mechanical ventilation or with life-threatening conditions were excluded. Fourth, there was no clinical trial to examine the influence of the customized target range of 5.8–8.9 mmol/L on clinical outcome. However, our results, along with previous studies, demonstrated that the SGC system had the advantage of being adaptable to customized target ranges in different clinical scenarios. Fifth, bedside glucometers used to measure BG had insufficient accuracy for glycemic control in critically ill patients, especially if anemia is present.通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30]</u> Nevertheless, the glucometers were nowadays widely used in many ICUs,通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32]</u> with routine calibration indicating an accepted difference of 10%. Moreover, to overcome the inaccuracy resulting from documented deviation between capillary and arterial BG measurement, a more prominent issue in critically ill patients requiring vasopressin通用删除6(英):<u>[33,34,35]</u> but not in other patients,通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> we performed BG measurement by sampling the arterial blood in these patients. A small pilot study had shown that combining the eMPC algorithm with continuous glucose monitoring was a feasible method for BG control in cardiac surgery patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> A real closed loop system may achieve the desirable BG control in the future.\nIn conclusion, the customized SGC system with a BG target range of 5.8–8.9 mmol/L resulted in effective and reliable glycemic control with a low incidence of hypoglycemia in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation. However, this system led to an increase in workload for the medical staff. Further development of the SGC system is required to decrease the staff workload without reducing the quality of BG management. Further multicenter, large, randomized studies are also necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of the SGC system on BG control.\nWe would like to thank Hai-Yu Pang for his help in the statistical analysis work of the study, who now work in the biomathematics office in Peking Union Medical College Hospital.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

This may activate natural killer (NK) cells, leading to obstetric complications.\nIn the mother, NK cells and cytokines together produce immune tolerance, enabling the embryo to successfully evade the mother’s immune system. In addition, uterine NK (uNK) cells are involved in trophoblast cell invasion and spiral artery remodeling, secreting cytokines that regulate immune balance at the maternal-fetal interface. Changes in the number and function of NK cells and the imbalance between NK cells and other immune cells may lead to pathological pregnancy, including preeclampsia and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).\nImmune disorders caused by NK cells in APS are closely related to adverse obstetric events, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. This paper reviewed the relationship between NK cells and APS pathological pregnancy to provide a basis for the treatment of patients.\nThree possible pathways are recognized for the origin of uNK cells. In the first pathway, local microenvironments in the human decidua such as galactolectin 9/T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 signaling induce peripheral blood NK (pNK) cells to transform into an uNK-like phenotype. The second pathway may be the migration of CD16+ pNK cells into the uterine tissue, altering the uNK phenotype under the influence of factors such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). In addition, when co-cultured with decidual stromal cells in vitro, IL-15 stimulates CD34+ CD122+ CD127+ hematopoietic progenitors to differentiate into uNK cells.\nBased on function, NK cells contain two types of receptors, activating killer receptors (AKRs) and inhibiting killer receptors (IKRs). According to their structure, receptors can be divided into killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), killer cell lectin-like receptors (KLRs), and natural cytotoxic receptors (NCR). KIR, two Ig domains, and long cytoplasmic tail 1 (KIR2DL1), 2DL2, and 2DL3 are IKRs that bind with HLA-C to regulate the cytotoxicity of decidual NK cells 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. KIR, two Ig domains, and short cytoplasmic tail 1 (KIR2DS1) also interacts with HLA-C 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u> and activates downstream by combining with adaptor protein DAP12.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The immune receptor tyrosine-based activator (ITAM) in DAP12 activates NK cells and produces pro-inflammatory cytokines. NKG2 is a member of the KLR family, and NKG2D is an AKR that activates NK cells. NKG2A is an IKR that inhibits excessive NK cell activation, and it consists of three type I transmembrane receptors, NKp46, NKp44, and NKp30. NCR is an AKR-type receptor that lacks ITAM in cells and can activate signals via the three aforementioned receptors,通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> mediating the toxic effects of uNK cells. During pregnancy, optimal production of cytokines and growth factors (such as vascular endothelial-derived growth factor) occurs when the AKRs and IKRs of uNK cells are in homeostasis, enhancing maternal immune tolerance of embryonic cells 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. When the regulation of uNK cells at the maternal-fetal interface is unbalanced, excess harmful cytokines are produced, leading to abortion 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>.\nThrough their roles in trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling during early pregnancy, uNK cells promote embryonic development. TGF-β and interleukin-10 secreted by uNK cells are associated with promoting trophoblast cell invasion, evading maternal attack on the fetus, and enhancing angiogenesis 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. The absence of invasive extravascular trophoblasts in early-development spiral arteries suggests that uNK cells play an important role in the reconstruction of spiral arteries. As a result, uNK cells transform spiral arteries into highly dilated blood vessels, ensuring low-pressure blood flow to the placenta and developing fetus 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. In addition, CD49a+ Eomes+ uNK cells produce growth factors that promote embryonic development before placenta establishment in humans and mice.\nNormal development of a fetus can be contributed to the normal number and percentage of pNK and uNK cells during pregnancy. Current studies on pNK cells in patients with RPL have yielded conflicting results. Previous studies have found no significant difference in the number of pNK cells in RPL patients. However, Kuon et al通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> found that the absolute number and percentage of pNK cells in RPL patients were higher than those in the healthy control group. The different results of studies on pNK cells in RPL women may be due to differences in experimental methods and different periods of pregnancy. Zhang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> linked the increased number and percentage of uNK cells to preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. These results suggest that the number and percentage of pNK and uNK cells should be maintained within a certain range to ensure normal embryonic development.\nDuring normal pregnancy, NK cells play an important role in mediating immune tolerance and promoting embryonic growth. In APS patients, the imbalance between NK cells and other immune cells and their secreted cytokines may lead to maternal rejection of the fetus. Studies have shown that anti-β2GPI antibodies inhibit trophoblastic cell autophagy, induce excessive activation of inflammasomes, and increase secretion of pro-inflammatory factor IL-1β, thereby triggering excessive activation of the maternal and fetal interface inflammatory response.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> This may be the pathogenic mechanism of APS-induced RPL. In APS patients, β2GPI polarizes helper T (Th) cells into Th17 cells and activates uNK cells in the placenta to produce interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), mediating their cytotoxic activity against target cells,通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> which may damage placental endothelial cells and lead to the placental microthrombus formation. Excessive TNFα induces the proliferation of uNK cells and promotes their differentiation into cytotoxic lymphofactor-cytotoxic killer cells, leading to APS-RPL.\nNK cells can adopt anti-trophoblast characteristics under specific conditions. For example, uNK cells, which are abnormally activated in mice in response to inflammation caused by bacterial endotoxins, target embryonic tissue and induce fetal absorption. The uNK cell-induced remodeling of uterine arteries and placental damage can be reversed by inhibiting uNK cells using NK cell antibodies (ie, by reducing the number of uNK cells and inhibiting NKp46). In addition, low-dose rapamycin increased the number of uNK cells and decreased the expression levels of NKG2D, NKP30, and NKP46 through autophagy in aborted NK cell-depleted mice, thus promoting embryo absorption in aborted mouse models.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Therefore, the intervention in animal models indicates that the abnormal number and function of NK cells may be closely related to pathological pregnancy.\nAbnormal numbers and functions of NK cells in patients with APS can lead to miscarriage. However, appropriate intervention can increase the success rate of pregnancies. Studies have shown that uNK cells are elevated in women with pathological pregnancy. Prednisone was confirmed to reduce uNK cell number通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>; however, it did not improve pregnancy outcomes. In addition, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can increase the live birth rate in patients with abortions. Ahmadi et al通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> found that the percentage and cytotoxicity of NK cells in RPL patients treated with IVIG were significantly reduced and that the expression levels of KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2, and KIR2DL3 in NK cells were increased, while the expression levels of NKG2A and KIR2DS1 were significantly decreased, which promoted live birth rate in the IVIG group.\nSuccessful pregnancy is the result of a complex confluence of factors. The interaction between NK cells and cytokines inhibits inflammation and aids to establish a balanced immune network at the maternal-fetal interface. Changes in the number of uNK cells, dysfunction, and proportional imbalance with other immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface may play a key role in APS-RPL. The specific signaling pathways and cytokines involved in NK cell immune regulation imbalance remain unclear; therefore, further studies are needed to provide effective immune or targeted therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Multiple laboratory test options can be used to detect Chlamydia, including cell culture, antigen detection methods, serologic tests, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs).6 Currently, point-of-care (POC) assay is the main method used in China.\nExternal quality assurance (EQA)/proficiency testing is a key part of quality assurance for methods intended for clinical purposes as laboratory capacity evaluation. In China, National Center for STDs Control launched EQA testing for C. trachomatis detection among STD surveillance sites since 2007.7 In this study, we analyzed the results of six EQAs from 2013 to 2018 to assess laboratory capabilities for detecting C. trachomatis of the STD surveillance system among China to further provide evidence for effect evaluation and strategy regulations of prevention and control of C. trachomatis.\nGeographically, 31 provinces, province-level municipalities, and province-level autonomous regions in China were divided into six regional groups: Northern China, Northeastern China, Northwestern China, Eastern China, Southern China, and Southwestern China. From 2008, a total of 1,048 hospitals located in 105 national STD sentinel sites have been selected as sentinel hospitals by the Ministry of Health.8 From 2013 to 2018, two units of each national STD sentinel site in every province except Tibet Autonomous Region were selected by the provincial center responsible for STD prevention to participate in this EQA program. The provincial central STD laboratories, one provincial general hospital (GH), and all laboratories from the China-Gonococcal Resistance Surveillance Program were invited to participate in the EQA program.\nThe mouse fibroblast cell line McCoy cells (CRL-1696, ATCC), which were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockefeller, MD, USA), were grown and passaged in RPMI-1640 (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin after thawing. Cells were seeded in new plates the day before infection.\nThe human urogenital isolate of C. trachomatis serovar E-Bour was originally obtained from ATCC (VR 348B) and has been maintained in STD reference laboratory, National Center for STDs Control, for future experiments. A total of 106 E-Bour inclusion-forming units were added directly to the 80% confluent cells, after which the plate was centrifuged (3,000 g, 60 minutes) to enhance infection. The infected cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 48 hours. The cell suspension was sonicated at 50 W (three times, 30 seconds each), and the resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C.9 Centrifugal precipitates of C. trachomatis were stored in SPG medium (0.2 mol/L sucrose, 8.6 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 3.8 mmol/L KH2PO4, and 5 mmol/L glutamic acid [pH 7.4]) at -80°C for further experiments.\nEach EQA panel consisted of three positive samples and two negative samples. The stored C. trachomatis were mixed, and the concentrations of the samples were regulated using normal saline based on the quantitative results of nucleic acid amplification (Daan Gene Co, Ltd of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong, China). The working concentrations for the three positive samples were 1×106 copies/mL, 1×105 copies/mL, and 1×104 copies/mL. The negative samples were composed of cell culture samples without C. trachomatis. Each sterile swab was soaked in 50 μL of sample, dried for 4 hours in an incubator chamber at 37°C, and then stored at 4°C before distribution in the EQA panel. The positive samples in each panel were divided into high (5×104 copies/swab), medium (5×103 copies/swab), and low (5×102 copies/swab) concentrations.10 Ten prepared swabs for each panel were selected randomly to pretest their uniformity using Daan real-time PCR tests, which are referred to as the standard in CNAS GL003 \"Guidance on Evaluating the Homogeneity and Stability of Samples Used for Proficiency Testing.\" 11\nAll the EQA panels were shipped from the STD reference laboratory, National Center for STDs Control in Nanjing via surface mail at ambient temperature (approximately 10–20°C) to provincial central STD laboratory within 1 week, after which the provincial central STD laboratories sent the EQA panels to participating laboratory, and then the participating laboratories tested the specimen for C. trachomatis by the common used method. Participating laboratories reported their results within 30 days via the National STD Management Information System, and then the reported results were compared with the standard results.\nStatistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) for descriptive and inferential analyses. Sensitivity for positive samples with different C. trachomatis concentration and specificity for negative samples were compared using the Z test, values of P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to study the associations between variables with the sensitivity for positive samples with low C. trachomatis concentration (102 copies/swab). Variables with a significance level of P≤0.10 in the univariate analysis results were included in a multivariate logistic regression model for further analysis of variables association. Interactions between the independent variables were applied in model analyses. AORs and the 95% CIs were estimated; values of P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nFrom 2013 to 2018, a total of six surveys were conducted including 1,583 laboratory time covering 310 laboratories. Overall, 29.58% (310/1048) laboratories participated in this program during these 6 years; 213 (68.71%) laboratories participated in the EQA program for six times, and 21/310 (6.77%) and 23/310 (7.42%) laboratories participated in this program for five and four times, respectively.\nAs shown in Table 1, majority of participating laboratories (1,025/1,583[64.75%]) were from GH, and maternal and child health care hospitals (MCH) and dermatology hospitals (DH) accounted for 105/1,583 (6.63%) and 57/1,583 (3.60%), respectively. Three methods (immunochromatographic test [ICT], NAAT method, and ELISA) were used in participating laboratories for C. trachomatis detection during the past 6 years, and immunochromatographic test, NAAT method, and ELISA were used in 1,214 (76.69%), 341 (21.54%), and 28 (1.77%) laboratories, respectively; the use of NAAT was significantly increasing from 2013 to 2018 with an annual growth rate of 11.59%.\nBaseline data of participating laboratories, n (%).\n删除重复语句：<u>Baseline data of participating laboratories, n (%).</u>\nDH: dermatology hospital; GH: general hospital; ICT: immunochromatographic test; MCH: maternal and child health care hospital; NAAT: nucleic acid amplification testing; PCA: prevention and control agencies.\nThe total sensitivities of six times were 36.89% (95% CIs: 34.52%–39.33%), 94.31% (95% CIs: 93.03%–95.38%), and 95.51% (95% CIs: 94.35%–96.46%) for the low, medium, and high concentration samples of C. trachomatis, respectively.

To our knowledge, the current EQA program using mock samples with inactivated C. trachomatis is the first program in China that has monitored the performance of different diagnostic methods for Chlamydia, focusing on not only the nucleic acid12,13,14 but also the antigen.\nFrom the present study, we found that the detection sensitivity for the C. trachomatis samples with medium and high concentration and the specificity of negative samples were almost satisfied with a rate generally around 95% whatever the regions, hospitals, and methods. In contrast, significant differences among different regions, hospitals, and methods were found on the detection of C. trachomatis samples with low concentration.\nIn multivariable analyses, we found that the detecting rate of accuracy on C. trachomatis samples with low concentration in laboratories located in South China and East China was twice of that in those located in Northwest China. One possible reason is that the incidence of reported C. trachomatis cases in Southern China or Eastern China is higher than that in Northern China, so the degree of familiarity with Chlamydia detection among technicians in Southern China and Eastern China is much better than that of technicians in Northwest China.\nDifferences in performance for the low-concentration samples were also associated with the hospital type. Reported C. trachomatis cases were mainly from general hospitals (66.00%–74.22%); 13.30%–17.18% of cases were from maternal and child health care hospitals, and 7.03%–11.48% of cases were from dermatology hospitals. Almost no reported C. trachomatis cases were from prevention and control agencies.5 This finding is consistent with the detecting rate of accuracy on low-concentration samples among different kinds of hospitals.\nThe laboratories in prevention and control agencies are very important locally because they are responsible for technical guidance and supervision of the detection quality for notifiable infectious diseases. However, because C. trachomatis is not a notifiable infectious disease in China, prevention and control agencies may pay less attention to this pathogen. Our findings suggest that it could be beneficial to train the relevant staff in the prevention and control agencies on C. trachomatis detection.\nEQA schemes can provide ongoing post-market surveillance of quantification errors associated with a particular technology, identify the best technologies to use, identify training needs, and indicate the need for governments to validate and standardize equipment and methodologies. From our results, NAATs are more sensitive and specific compared with antigen detection assays (such as ICT or ELISA methods for detecting Chlamydia antigen)15,16,17; however, the requirements for specific equipment and sufficient room for such equipment prohibit the widespread use for C. trachomatis detection in China, especially in underdeveloped regions.18 The development of a true point of care (POC) diagnostic method for Chlamydia based on NAATs that does not require any special equipment remains an as-yet-unrealized goal.删除4：<u>19</u>\nThe majority of laboratories (nearly 80%) in our EQA program used an immunochromatographic test to detect the C. trachomatis antigen. More than 20 different manufacturers’ kits were used from 2013 to 2018. Although the specificity of C. trachomatis antigen detection tests was >90%, the sensitivities of these tests were suboptimal, especially when used on samples with a low concentration of C. trachomatis (<30%), and it may partly explain why the reported incidence rate of genital Chlamydia in China was only one-tenth of that in the United States.20 Methods with excellent sensitivity and specificity for C. trachomatis should be introduced into more laboratories in China.\nChina has unbalanced development among its different zones. In underdeveloped hospitals, the selected POC diagnostic method has been widely used for a long period of time; therefore, laboratories in prevention and control agencies should guide these hospitals to select a POC diagnostic method with excellent sensitivity and specificity. Notably, given the wide range of available options, performing a post-market evaluation of the performance of antigen-based POC diagnostic methods for C. trachomatis is challenging. Our data suggest that more corporations making home diagnostic products should be encouraged to develop NAAT-based POC methods because it may be more easier for NAAT-based methods to meet the Reassured (Real-time connectivity, Ease of specimen collection and environmental friendliness, Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment free, Deliverable to end-users) criteria compared with antigen-based POC methods.删除4：<u>18</u>\nFalse-negative test results due to low sensitivity lead to a lack of timely treatment and subsequent long-term reproductive sequelae, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal infertility.2 Fourteen countries have current policies regarding antenatal screening for C. trachomatis infection.4 Based on the suboptimal detective rate of antigen-based POC diagnostic methods widely used in China, the infection conditions of C. trachomatis and potential sequelae caused is much more challenged. The attention of prevention and control agencies and local administrative departments of China should be attracted toward the harm caused by Chlamydia infection.\nThere are some limitations in this study. First, the EQA program used simulated specimens in place of real clinical specimens, which may affect the evaluation results, especially for negative samples. However, it would be very difficult to obtain the required volume of an endocervical swab medium with sufficient uniformity for consistency across panels. Although urine could be another reasonable choice for use in an EQA program,11 urine samples are not suitable for the assays used by most Chinese laboratories to detect the C. trachomatis antigen. The mock specimens were selected based on their ability to be assessed by many different methodologies and to define stability, concentration, and uniformity. Second, only the E strain of C. trachomatis was selected for the EQA panel. Monitoring capabilities for the new Swedish variant that was detected in Sweden21 were insufficient during the study period, and the prevalence of this variant of C. trachomatis declined after the introduction of appropriate testing.22 Furthermore, our previous study found that no cases of the new Swedish variant23,24 of C. trachomatis were detected in the high-risk population in China.25 Third, this study did not include inhibitors or their indicators, such as hemoglobin, nitrates, and human chorionic gonadotropin, in the specimens, although cell culture fluid with 1640 culture medium was used.\nIn summary, the performance of participating laboratories in the detection of C. trachomatis in mock EQA specimens was diverse. The immunochromatographic test is widely used in the participating laboratories in China; however, the detection of C. trachomatis using immunochromatographic tests is suboptimal to those detected using NAAT and ELISA methods. Methods with good sensitivity and specificity for C. trachomatis detection, such as NAAT-based point-of-care diagnostic methods, should be promoted in more laboratories in China.\nThis work was supported by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Initiative for Innovative Medicine (2016- I2M-3–021).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The 31 patients were examined by CTSP and the appearanec of PHC was compared with their pathological results to evaluate the diagnostic significance of CTSP.\n\n【2】Results\nThe animal experiment showed that both CTAP and CTSP could obviously enhance the density of the liver (P &lt; 0.01), but no significant difference was observed in the enhanced densities between the two methods (P > 0.05). On the CTSP images of the 31 patients, the density of the livers was increased to 168 - 192 Hu, whereas the density of the cancers was as low as that on the images of CT scans (&lt; 58 Hu). The CTSP findings were consistent with the surgical ones from space occupying lesions. The diagnostic value of CTSP was obviously superior to that of general enhanced CT. However, it was difficult for CTSP to show nodules less than 1 cm in size located on the surface of the liver or the hepatic portal zone.\n\n【3】Conclusions\nLike CTAP, CTSP is also a sensitive method for showing occupant in the liver. But the equipments and the procedures are simpler for CTSP than for CTAP. CTSP is an alternative procedure in clinical practice.

In theory, the non-necrotic area is able to prevent further collapse of the femoral head by the presence of the smooth cartilage and normal sub-chondral bone. Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of TRO for different types of symptomatic ONFH with mild or moderate collapse, such as steroid-induced, alcoholinduced, post-traumatic, and idiopathic ONFH.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20,21]</u>\nHowever, the clinical outcome of TRO remains controversial because the promising results of several Japanese studies could not be confirmed by American and European studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23,24]</u> On the contrary, TRO was still recommended as an effective joint-preserving surgery for ONFH by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association recently,通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> and a latest meta-analysis demonstrated that the clinical results of future THA were not affected by TRO.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>\nTherefore, we aimed to resolve these controversies by performing a meta-analysis to assess the efficiency of TRO in ONFH. The primary outcomes of interest were 5- and 10- year hip survival rates 通用删除1(英):<u>(with radiographic failure or conversion to THA or hemi-arthroplasty as the endpoint, respectively)</u>, as well as Merle d’Aubigne and Postel hip score通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> after TRO.\nElectronic search was performed independently by multiple investigators from the date of inception until June 2019.

Any disagreements between investigators were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer.\nThe methodologic quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for assessing risk of bias (ROB) in case-control and cohort studies通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> and using the Cochrane Collaboration for assessing ROB in RCTs.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> Any discrepancy between studies was resolved through discussion.\nOf the included studies, 15 were cohort studies without control groups, and four were case-control studies with dissimilar control groups. Therefore, the data, including hip survival rate or excellent and good rate after TRO, provided in all the included studies were considered as noncomparative binary variables, and the effect indicator with their standard errors (SEs) were calculated using the two methods reported by Chen et al通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> using the following parameters: P, the hip survival rate or excellent and good rate after TRO; SE; X, the number of hip survival patients or excellent and good rate patients; and n, the total number of patients.\nMethod 1: when the total number of patients (n) was large enough and both n × P and n × (1 -P) are greater than 5, the following formula was used for calculation:\nThe meta-analysis with the outcomes was conducted using RevMan software by using risk difference (RD) as the effect index and the Generic Inverse Variance was then selected to calculate the merged effect size.\nMethod 2: when the numbers of hip survival patients or excellent and good patients (X) were 0 or both n × P and n × (1 -P) were less than or equal 5, the following formula was used for the calculation:\nThe meta-analysis with the outcomes was conducted using RevMan software using odds ratio (OR) as the effect index, and then generic inverse variance was selected to calculate the merged effect size. However, the final pooling rate (Pf) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were further using the following formulas:\nWhere appropriate, a sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding one study at a time to weigh up the relative influence of each individual study on the pooled effect size.\nStatistical analysis was performed using the Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3, Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). A statistical cutoff of significance for the overall estimates of effect was set at P < 0.05. The OR and RD for non-comparative binary data (hip survival rate after TRO, excellent, and good rate) with the 95% CIs for each outcome were calculated according to the method reported by Chen et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 using the standard Chi-squared test, and a fixed effects model was used for meta-analysis when a study was identified as statistically homogeneous (P > 0.1 and I2 < 50%). On the contrary, a random-effects model was used for analysis, and the sources of heterogeneity were analyzed, when statistical heterogeneity among studies was identified (P < 0.1, I2 > 50%). The funnel plot was used to assess publication bias, which was identified by an asymmetry in the funnel plot.\nA total of 7045 studies were identified by the preliminary literature search, of which only 5466 duplicate articles were excluded. Of the retained 1579 studies, 1545 were excluded based on the inclusion, and exclusion criteria mentioned in the Methods section. Full-text review of the remaining 34 studies resulted in the selection of a final set of 19 English publications. No extra articles were eligible for inclusion from the references lists in the retained articles. The search and exclusion process are shown in Figure 1.\nAmong the 19 selected studies, 4 were retrospective casecontrol studies and 15 were retrospective cohort studies通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>. Eleven of the 19 included studies were conducted in Japan, 4 were conducted in Korea, and 4 were conducted in non-Asian countries including the United States, the Netherlands, Austria, and France 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.

The details of NOS scores are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and Tables 2, http://links.lww. com/CM9/A137. The methodologic quality of the included studies was relatively stable. However, all included studies were retrospective case studies rather than RCTs, which may lead to selection bias, performance bias, and attrition bias.\nA meta-analysis was conducted on the 5- and 10-year hip survival rate after TRO with conversion to THA or hemiarthroplasty as the endpoint.\nAmong the articles that reported the 5-year hip survival rate after TRO, with conversion to THA or hemiarthroplasty as the endpoint, seven cohort studies (395 hips)通用删除6(英):<u>[24,31,36,38,39,40,43]</u> were eligible for Method 1. Fixed effects model meta-analysis showed heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 79%, P < 0.0001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A]</u>; thus, the subgroup analysis was adopted. The population was divided into Asian and non-Asian sub-group analysis was adopted.\nThe population was divided into Asian and non-Asian sub-population due to discrepancy of reports between Asian and non-Asian countries methods. Among the included studies, four were performed on Asian population and three were performed on non-Asian population. In the Asian subpopulation, fixed effects model meta-analysis (I2 = 0%, P = 0.45) showed that the hip survival rate in 5 years after TRO was 0.86 (95% CI 0.82–0.89, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A]</u>. On the contray, fixed effects model metaanalysis (I2 = 36%, P = 0.21) showed that the 5-year hip survival rate after TRO was 0.55 in the non-Asian subpopulation (95% CI 0.43–0.67, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A]</u>.\nAmong the articles that reported the hip survival rate for 5 years after TRO, with THA or hemi-arthroplasty as the endpoint, six cohort studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[24,33,35,37,41,42]</u> including 152 patients, were eligible for Method 2. Fixed effects model meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity across studies (I2= 11%, P= 0.35) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2B]</u>; therefore, the fixed effects model was adopted. According to the formulas in Method 2, the final pooling of data showed that the 5-year hip survival rate after TRO, with THA or hemi-arthroplasty as the endpoint, was 0.90 (95% CI 0.79–0.95, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2B]</u>.\nIn addition, all the four case-control studies, including 292 patients,通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45,46,47]</u> were eligible for Method 1. Random effects model meta-analysis (I2= 96%, P < 0.00001) showed that the 5-year hip survival rate after TRO, with THA or hemiarthroplasty as the endpoint, was 0.72 (95% CI 0.53–0.91, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2C]</u>. Sensitivity analysis showed that the heterogeneity was still significant after omitting the non-Asian study of Schneider et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> These results suggest that the main effects of heterogeneity could be related to small sample size and discrepancy in control groups among studies.\nAmong the included studies that reported 10-year hip survival rate after TRO, with THA or hemi-arthroplasty as the endpoint, four cohort studies, including 204 patients通用删除6(英):<u>[31,38,39,40]</u> were eligible for Method 1. Fixed-effects model meta-analysis showed that the heterogeneity was significant across studies (I2= 84%, P= 0.0004) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3A]</u>; so, the sub-group analysis was adopted.\nThe population was divided into Asian and non-Asian subpopulation. Among the included studies, two were performed on Asian population and two were from non- Asian population. For the Asian sub-population, fixedeffects model meta-analysis (I2 = 0%, P = 0.78) showed that the 10-year hip survival rate after TRO, with THA or hemiarthroplasty as the endpoint, was 0.72 (95% CI 0.65–0.78, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3A]</u>. For the non-Asian sub-population, fixed-effects model meta-analysis (I2 = 71%, P = 0.06) showed that the 10-year hip survival rate after TRO, with THA or hemi-arthroplasty as the endpoint, was 0.42 (95% CI 0.28–0.55, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3A]</u>.\nAmong the included articles that reported the 10-year hip survival rate after TRO, with THA or hemi-arthroplasty as the endpoint, five cohort studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[24,33,35,37,41]</u> including 135 patients, was eligible for Method 2. Fixed-effects model meta-analysis showed non-significant heterogeneity across samples (I2 = 0%, P= 0.45) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3B]</u>; so, the fixed-effects model was adopted. According to the formulas in Method 2, the final pooling of data showed that the 10-year hip survival rate after TRO, with THA or hemi-arthroplasty as the endpoint, was 0.89 (95% CI 0.81–0.94, P < 0.00001).\nA meta-analysis was then performed to determine the 5- and 10-year hip survival rates after TRO with radiographic failure as the endpoint. Radiographic failure was defined as secondary collapse of the femoral head or osteoarthritic change, including osteophyte formation and joint space narrowing.\nAmong the studies that reported the 5-year hip survival rate after TRO, with radiographic failure as the endpoint, three cohort studies (206 patients)通用删除6(英):<u>[24,31,32]</u> were eligible for the Method 1. Fixed-effects model meta-analysis (I2= 8%, P = 0.34) showed that the 5-year hip survival rate after TRO, with radiographic failure as the endpoint, was 0.70(95% CI 0.64–0.76, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4A]</u>.\nSimilarly, three studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35,39]</u> including 120 patients, that had reported the 5-year hip survival rate after TRO, with radiographic failure as the endpoint, were eligible for the Method 2. Fixed-effects model meta-analysis showed significant that heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 95%, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4B]</u>; thus, the random-effects model was adopted. Despite that sensitivity analysis showed that the heterogeneity originated from the results of Rijnen et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> the other two studies were also performed by the same team.通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35]</u> Regarding the probability of results bias, we decided to abandon pooling the data.\nAmong the included studies that reported the 10-year hip survival rate after TRO, with radiographic failure as the endpoint, only two cohort studies (158 patients)通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32]</u> were eligible for Method 1. Fixed-effects model meta-analysis(I2 = 40%, P = 0.20) showed that the 10-year hip survival rate after TRO was 0.53 (95% CI 0.46–0.61, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5A]</u>, with radiographic failure as the endpoint.\nOn the contrary, three cohort studies (120 patients)通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35,39]</u> were eligible for the Method 2, which had reported the 10-year hip survival rate after TRO, with radiographic failure as the endpoint. Fixed effects model meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 96%, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5B]</u>; so, the random-effects model was adopted. Although sensitivity analysis showed that the heterogeneity originated from the study performed by Rijnen et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> the other two articles were also performed by the same team.通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35]</u> Regarding the probability of results bias, we decided to abandon pooling the data.\nA meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate hip survival rate in patients with excellent and good Merle d’Aubigne and Postel hip scores after TRO. The Merle d’Aubigne and Postel hip score allocates up to 6 points each for pain, mobility and walking ability. Our meta-analysis included patients with excellent (17 or 18 points), good (15 or 16 points), fair (13 or 14 points), and poor (12 points) scores.\nAmong the studies that reported excellent and good scores after TRO at the last follow-up, four cohort studies (171 patients)通用删除6(英):<u>[23,36,40,41]</u> were eligible for Method 1. Fixedeffects model meta-analysis (I2= 83%, P= 0.0006) showed that the hip survival rate for excellent and good(Merle d’Aubigne and Postel hip score) at the last follow-up after TRO was 0.66 (95% CI 0.47–0.86, P < 0.00001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>.\nTRO was developed in 1973 by Sugioka通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> as a surgical treatment to relieve the pain, improve the joint function and prevent the progressive collapse of femoral head after osteonecrosis. TRO was divided into two alternative surgical procedures according to the different direction of rotation: ARO and PRO. Decision of ARO or PRO is generally made depending on the location of the necrotic area that is defined using preoperative lateral radiograph of the hip. ARO is usually recommended when the necrotic area in the femoral head is located toward the anterior part of the weight-bearing surface, while PRO is recommended when the necrotic area is located more toward the cranial or posterior part of the weight-bearing surface.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u>\nIn theory, necrotic bone is removed by TRO from the weight-bearing area and is replaced with normal bone that can prevent further collapse of the femoral head. Several reports in Japan and Korea have reported favorable longterm clinical effects of TRO on ONFH by preserving the collapsed femoral head for a longer time.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21,22,24,31,37]</u> In addition, several histologic studies have described new bone or normal bony architecture covering dead trabeculae as a result of fibrous tissue proliferation in the dead trabeculae after TRO, which was accompanied with vascular ingrowth and \"creeping substitution\" appearance.通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u>\nHowever, studies from the western countries have reported high failure rates after TRO in the early post-operative period. Indeed, Dean et al通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> reported only 17% satisfactory results of TRO for hips with ONFH during a mean follow-up of 5 years, while 83% of hips showed further collapse of the femoral head. On the contrary, Schneider et al通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> reported a 5-year hip survival probability of 0.26 after Sugioka’s osteotomy, and 0.15 after 10 years, which was also associated with a high incidence of complications (55.2%). In addition, Rijnen et al通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> showed that the radiologic survival rate after TRO was only 54% after 1 year. Therefore, multiple studies did not recommend TRO due to the high failure rate. Nevertheless, TRO was recently recommended as an effective joint-preserving surgery for ONFH by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association,通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> and a meta-analysis have recently demonstrated that the clinical outcomes of THA were not affected by TRO.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>\nThe inconsistency in the outcomes of TRO could be related to differences in various factors, such as the selection criteria of patients, ethnicity, body mass index of patients, blood supply to the femoral head, pre-operative stage of the necrosis, the extent of necrosis, the method of fixation, the surgical technique, and the post-operative management.通用删除6(英):<u>[36,50]</u> While the TRO signs reported by Sugioka included relatively widespread necrotic lesions, clinical outcomes of TRO were better in patients with stage II disease than in those with stage III disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> In addition, the incidence of non-union had been decreased by the replacement of the traditional cancellous bone screw fixation with more rigid fixation devices, such as the plate and screw system.通用删除6(英):<u>[52,53,54]</u> Furthermore, operative impairment of blood supply to the femoral head and the post-operative intact ratio could be associated with the progressive collapse after TRO. In addition, good intraoperative care should be taken during osteotomy to avoid the impairment of medial femoral circumflex artery, and a post-operative intact ratio should be more than 34% to achieve favorable outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[51,55]</u> Interestingly, the non- Asian countries study by Langlais et al通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> has reported that 47% of patients with ONFH showed favorable outcomes within 10 years after TRO, which underscores the importance of the above factors, especially in Caucasians.\nIn this regard, we have conducted a meta-analysis to assess the 5- and 10-year hip survival rates after TRO in an attempt to solve the controversies on applying TRO for ONFH treatment that have been raised by the inconsistent results from different studies.\nA total of 19 studies on the use of TRO for ONFH treatment were eligible for our meta-analysis according to inclusion criteria. Two calculation methods, Methods 1 and 2, were adopted in this meta-analysis.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> In addition, sub-group analysis was performed to evaluate the 5- and 10-year hip survival rates (Method 1) after TRO in ONFH patients: Asian sub-population and non-Asian sub-population. By setting the conversion to THA or hemiarthroplasty as the endpoint, the current meta-analysis showed a higher 5- and 10-year hip survival rates TRO for ONFH patients in the Asian population, compared with the non-Asian population, regardless the method of calculation used. In comparison, although 5- year hip survival rate after TRO was not satisfactory in non-Asian population, the 10-year outcome was relatively tolerable. Moreover, despite the limited literature, the 5- and 10-year hip survival rates of pooled TRO in ONFH patients were 0.70 and 0.53, respectively, when choosing radiographic failure as the endpoint.\nExcept for two results, heterogeneity was low in this metaanalysis. One of the two results was from the analysis in four case-control studies on the 5-year hip survival rate after TRO with THA or hemi-arthroplasty as the endpoint. Sensitivity analysis showed that the heterogeneity remained significant after omitting the result of the non- Asian study by Schneider et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> We speculated that the important factors of heterogeneity could be related to the small sample size and to discrepancies in the control groups. The other result was from the analysis of the 5-year hip survival rate after TRO with radiographic failure as the endpoint. Although sensitivity analysis showed that the heterogeneity was originated from the results of Rijnen et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> another two studies were performed by the same authors.通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35]</u> Regarding the probability of results bias, we decided to abandon pooling the data of the above two results. In addition, we have also conducted a metaanalysis on the excellent and good Merle d’Aubigne and Postel hip scores rates after TRO; however, the heterogeneity was significant. We therefore speculated that the important factors of heterogeneity could be related to the difference in follow-up time. Therefore, we should be cautious in interpreting the pooled results.\nFinally, certain limitations in this meta-analysis that may affect the validity of our results should not be ignored. First, the quality of the included studies is not optimal due to the lack of RCTs on TRO, which prevented us from reaching a robust conclusion. Second, we have only included English and Chinese literatures without considering the effect of other studies with different languages on the current results of this meta-analysis, which might cause some sort of bias in the results. Third, the sources of clinical heterogeneity were not considered, including age, body mass index, pre-operative stage and extent of necrosis, the method of fixation, the surgical technique, and the postoperative management. Fourth, the number of patients included in this meta-analysis was relatively small due to the limited number of studies included, which can weaken the statistical analysis validity. Finally, we were unable to detect potential publication bias by funnel plots due to the limited number of included studies.\nIn conclusion, given the data collected, our findings demonstrate that the 5- and 10-year hip survival rates in ONFH patients after TRO were satisfactory in the Asian population and were relatively acceptable in the non-Asian population despite high early failure rates. Therefore, TRO could be an effective hip-preserving alternative for young patients or active population with symptomatic ONFH when patients are appropriately selected, the surgical procedure is accurately performed, and adequate postoperative rehabilitation is provided. Nevertheless, RCTs with larger sample sizes and that include the different races of Asian and non-Asian population are needed to confirm these results.\nThis work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81802151)</u>; Shandong Province Natural Science Foundation 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. ZR2016HQ05, No. ZR2017BH089, and No. ZR2019MH012)</u>; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2018M642616)</u>; and Qingdao Applied Foundational Research Youth Project 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 19-6-2-55-cg)</u>\nNone.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Then, SARS-CoV-2 can interact with the immune system of the body, leading to individual immune system disorders, which can explain the various clinical manifestations of this disease通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\nAutopsies of patients with COVID-2019 have shown a high macrophage infiltration rate, suggesting an initial immune response of macrophages to the virus通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. It has been reported that more than 60% of patients have a decrease in lymphocyte count (less than 1.0 × 109/L) in their peripheral blood, and this proportion could exceed 80%通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. Moreover, neutrophilia could be detected in patients with severe COVID-19, and the neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio has been associated with a poor prognosis of this disease通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Studies have also reported that an increase in the number of monocytes could be observed in the damaged vessels of patients with COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In addition, the numbers of T and natural killer (NK) cells in patients with COVID-19 significantly decreased. Simultaneously, the regulatory cell (Treg) count decreased significantly in severe COVID-19 patients通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. These results suggest that the dual reduction of innate immunity and adaptive immunity in patients with COVID-19 significantly leads to an impaired ability of the immune system to eliminate the virus通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. At present, it is believed that this immune response is not simply activated or inhibited but is reflected in the disorder of the body’s defense mechanism.\nStudies have shown that there are significant increases in the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4), chemokine (CK), and colony stimulating factor (CSF) in patients with COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u>. The continuous interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the target cells leads to the recruitment of inflammation-related cells, the continuous release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the continuous aggravation of the systemic inflammatory response, which is considered as the cytokine release syndrome and is commonly known as the cytokine storm (CS)通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 only inhibits the IFN signaling pathway, specifically, the expression of IFN-1, and the secretion of chemokines is not inhibited通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>, in fact, the expression of many inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CCL-2, CCL-3, and CCL-5) is increased通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In addition, increased plasma IL-2 and IL-6 levels have been observed in patients with severe COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. After the activation of primary cytokines, CD8+T cells, NK cells, Treg cells, and Th2 cells can secrete secondary cytokines such as IFN-γ, bidirectional regulatory protein, or IL-5 to clear the virus and inhibit inflammation通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 repeatedly acts on super-activated T cells and produces a large number of granulocyte macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and IL-6, which further activate CD14+CD16+monocytes, resulting in a CS and multi-organ dysfunction通用删除6(英):<u>[8,14]</u>. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 can over-activate immune cells and inhibit negative regulation, so that the immune process will be continuously amplified, causing corresponding damage to the body通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\nEndometriosis is a disease in which activated endometrial glands or stroma are implanted outside of the uterine cavity. Endometriosis usually leads to the progressive exacerbation of secondary dysmenorrhea, abnormal menstruation, and even infertility通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Studies have suggested that there are other regulatory mechanisms leading to the occurrence and development of EM, in addition to retrograde menstruation通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18]</u>.\nAbnormal immune system function might be an important mechanism of EM 通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u>. Several studies further revealed that the following phenomena can be observed in EM patients: decreased T-cell response activity and NK cell cytotoxicity, increased polyclonal activation and antibody production of B cells, increased number and activation of peritoneal macrophages, and changes in inflammatory mediators通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. In patients with EM, the transformation of T cells into helper T cells (Th2) increases, and the activation of systemic and local humoral reactions caused by the change of Th1/Th2 cell ratio is closely related to EM通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u>. In addition, IL-27 triggers Th17 cells to secrete IL-10 through the c-Maf/RORγt/Blimp-1 signaling pathway, which promotes the growth and implantation of ectopic lesions通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) was detected in the lesions of deep rectosigmoid EM/ovarian EM, and the number of Treg cells in the peritoneal fluid and endometrium of patients with EM was significantly increased, indicating that Treg cells may play a role in the immune pathogenesis of EM通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24,25,26]</u>. B lymphocytes may also play a role in the pathogenesis of EM by secreting autoantibodies通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>, while studies have shown that NK cells in EM show reduced cytotoxicity due to increased expression of killer inhibitory receptors (KIR), resulting in immune escape of ectopic endometrium and further adhesion and invasion of the ectopic endometrium通用删除6(英):<u>[21,28]</u>. Neutrophils produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), IL-8, IL-12, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 10, CXCL12, and so on, which can promote EM progression通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. Moreover, recent studies have shown that macrophages migrate to the M2 type during EM, which may increase the local production of factors that promote angiogenesis and endometrial cell invasion通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>.\nAs mentioned above, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is mainly due to a disorder of the immune system, which manifests as an abnormal number of immune cells and the release of many inflammatory factors. The occurrence and development of EM are also closely related to the immune condition of the body. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on the occurrence and development of EM, but there are no exact reports at present.\nIn the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes slightly increase, while the number of lymphocytes significantly decrease with the progression of this disease. In addition, the number of other immune cells (such as NK cells, Treg cells, and so on) decreases significantly, and the body is in a serious immunosuppressive state通用删除6(英):<u>[7,10]</u>. Studies suggest that the T-cell response activity and NK cytotoxicity of patients with EM are significantly reduced, and the proportion of Th2 cells is increased, which provides the microenvironment required for immune escape for ectopic endometrium通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Therefore, for patients with EM, the immunosuppressive state caused by COVID-19 will help the ectopic endometrium escape the body’s clearance and may even aggravate the implantation and invasion of ectopic endometrium.\nIn addition to the abnormal number of immune cells, patients with COVID-19 have excessive secretion of inflammation-related cytokines, resulting in an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, which is called macrophage activation syndrome or CS通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Studies suggest that the release of immune cells increases the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF) and chemokines (such as CCL-2, CCL-3, CCL-5, CCL7, and CCL12)通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In addition, the inflammatory response associated with EM involves a variety of immune cells (such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells), which are attracted and accumulated by chemokines (such as CXCL-8, CCL-2, CCL-5, and so on). After the accumulation of immune cells, the ectopic endometrium releases a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and so on), which promote the invasion of ectopic lesions通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. These chemokines and inflammatory factors are consistent with those in patients with COVID-19, suggesting that the CS in patients with COVID-19 may provide a suitable inflammatory environment for the occurrence and development of EM. An increase in VEGF has been observed in patients with COVID-19 and EM通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32,33]</u>. Therefore, COVID-19 may affect the occurrence and development of EM as angiogenesis continues.\nIt was reported in studies that Actinomycetes, Firmicutes, Verrucous microflora, Proteus, Bifidobacteria, Burkholderia, Escherichia coli, and Shigella increased significantly in the intestinal microorganisms of patients with EM, and Gardnerella decreased in the intestinal flora通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. The immune imbalance, inflammatory response, and abnormal estrogen metabolism caused by the disorder of the intestinal microbiota may be important factors in the occurrence of EM通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. In addition, animal experiments have confirmed that feeding fecal particles of mice with EM to other mice could promote the growth and invasion of ectopic lesions通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>. The study found that for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by gastrointestinal symptoms, there was an intestinal microecological imbalance, which was specifically manifested in a decrease in the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium species), beneficial bacteria (such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria), and an increase in some common pathogens (such as Prevotella, Enterococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, or Campylobacter)通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. The increase in Enterobacteriaceae was similar between EM patients and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Intestinal microecological disorders caused by COVID-19 may promote the occurrence of EM and the further development of ectopic lesions.\nDue to the novelty of the virus, the uncertainty of treatment methods, the lack of vaccines, and the delay of medical measures for chronic diseases, among others通用删除6(英):<u>[38,39]</u>, COVID-19 brings great psychological pressure to the masses通用删除6(英):<u>[18,40]</u>. More than 45% of patients with COVID-19 have anxiety symptoms, and approximately 30% have depressive symptoms. At the same time, the results suggest that female sex is an independent risk factor for anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. A cohort study of 14,144 patients in Switzerland showed that the risk ratios of depression and anxiety in EM patients were 1.88 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.78-1.99) and 2.01 (95% CI: 1.92-2.11)通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>, suggesting that depression and anxiety significantly increase the risk of EM. Animal experiments revealed that exposure to psychological pressure before modeling significantly increased cell proliferation and macrophage infiltration of ectopic lesions of EM, resulting in an increase in lesion size and growth speed通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>. During the epidemic period of COVID-19, the psychological pressure on non-EM women is increased, consequently, increasing the risk of EM. However, the impact of COVID-19 on the management of EM in patients remains controversial. A study in Turkey showed that 53.63% of patients thought the management of their EM was affected by the pandemic通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>, and the impact of COVID-19 on the care of people with EM was found worldwide通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>. Due to COVID-19, women with EM experience increased tension and anxiety that their diseases cannot be diagnosed and treated in time通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u>. However, another study found that EM symptoms in most patients were much easier to manage, and they were more productive because of the flexibility in working hours and the increased ability to self-manage their time通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>.\nEndometriosis is a female-specific condition; on the other hand, a study showed that there was no significant difference in the viral load and immune response of COVID-19 between the two sexes通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u>. At the same time, a small number of sex-related differences have been reported in which a stronger T-cell response is observed in female patients as compared to T-cell response in male patients, which may lead to aggravation of the disease通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u>. Another study showed that the antibody titer in male patients with COVID-19 was higher than that in female patients通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>. Endometriosis mostly occurs in women of gestational age (20-45 years)通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>, whereas COVID-19 can occur in all age ranges. Compared to that of young patients, the adaptive immune response of patients over 65 years of age is uncoordinated通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>. Compared to that of children, adults have a stronger T-cell response to viral spinous process proteins and higher serum neutralizing antibody titers通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>. In the age group prone to EM, the COVID-19 disease was mostly mild or moderate. Therefore, immune disorders and abnormal activation of inflammatory responses are relatively limited in these age groups, and their impact on the occurrence and development of EM may be relatively limited.\nCOVID-19 may have an impact on the occurrence and development of EM but also on the typical clinical symptoms of women with EM, such as pelvic pain, emotional anxiety, and infertility.\nPelvic pain is the most common symptom in EM. Women with EM may experience periodic or a periodic pelvic pain such as dysmenorrhea通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u>, and pain-related symptoms may worsen under stress通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>. Given the added anxiety because of the pandemic, patients with EM may be more sensitive to pelvic pain from EM. Studies have found that changes in social distancing may exacerbate pain intensity during the COVID-19 pandemic通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u>. On the contrary, other studies suggested that the change in social distance did not cause significant deterioration of pain intensity, and not all psychological stress aggravated chronic pain通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the burden on most women was even heavier due to the increase in housework, childcare, and more study time of children at home instead of in school通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u>. Thus, these may aggravate the pain symptoms of EM, which may even lead to the need for an increased dosage of painkillers通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>. Some scholars speculate that this phenomenon may also occur because COVID-19 prevents EM patients from receiving routine treatment or selective surgical treatment in hospitals通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>. Therefore, during social isolation caused by COVID-19, more patients with EM experience pain and anxiety通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>. In addition, previous studies have shown that care and concern from other people also seem to have beneficial effects in alleviating pain通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u>. Social disconnection and loneliness caused by the COVID-19 pandemic affect the intensity of pain and may lead to the aggravation of pain-related symptoms通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u>.\nIn addition to the common symptoms of pelvic pain, EM can also lead to female infertility. Patients with EM-related infertility have been under pressure from their families and themselves, and many of them require assisted reproductive technology (ART). There is no conclusive evidence that ART or pregnancy increases the risk of COVID-19. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is recommended to suspend ART and postpone all non-emergency operations (such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer). Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of psychological and mental diseases has increased通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u>. Infertile women in urgent need of pregnancy may be more vulnerable to negative psychosocial effects. The COVID-19 epidemic and infertility stress are both important sources of stress通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u>. Some patients are unable to face the temporary closure of reproductive medicine centers, and even a small number of patients have a strong sense of despair, resulting in deterioration of health status and impairment of mental health通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u>. From the perspective of female fertility, a delay in ART treatment will reduce the probability of successful pregnancy, especially in older women. In addition, the anxiety of elderly women is becomes more severe, which may adversely affect ovarian function通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u>. At the same time, studies have shown that only about one-third of patients experience EM-related changes, suggesting that the impact of COVID-19 on clinical problems related to EM may be over-estimated. Patients with EM will not bear pressure similar to that of infertile patients, owing to the temporary suspension of ART treatment通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\nThis review focuses on the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EM. The occurrence and development of COVID-19 and EM are accompanied by abnormalities in the immune system. Many inflammatory factors are released in patients with COVID-19, which may increase the risk of EM occurrence or aggravate the severity of EM. At the same time, the body of patients with COVID-19 is in a condition of severe immunosuppression, which also provides a suitable environment for ectopic endometrium to escape from clearance. Whether the impact of COVID-19 on the endometrial microenvironment can lead to the occurrence and development of EM is worthy of further investigation. On the other hand, the occurrence of COVID-19 has no association with sex and age, while EM mostly occurs in women of gestational age. These findings show that COVID-19 not only has an important impact on the occurrence and development of EM  but also has a certain impact on the typical clinical symptoms of EM . Mandatory isolation and increased psychological pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic may aggravate the feeling of pelvic pain from EM. For EM-infertile patients, delayed ART treatment will bring greater psychological pressure and even promote the further development of EM. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on EM. During the COVID-19 pandemic, more attention should be paid to women prone to EM or with EM and effective methods should be further explore to reduce these impacts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Pain and ulcers of the leg are the main causes of patient seeking medical aid; however, a presentation of multiple ulcers is rare. Herein we report a case of ASO presenting as multiple leg ulcers.\nA 72-year-old man with nonpainful skin ulcers on the left leg for 1 year presented at Guangzhou First People’s Hospital in Oct 2017. The patient had first noticed the ulcers 1 year earlier, and most of the ulcers had healed on their own within a few weeks. However, new ulcers with intermittent claudication subsequently developed and had not healed for the past 2 months. The patient reported chest pain with a squeezing sensation or discomfort for almost 1 month. Except for a smoking history of 30 packs a month, his medical history was otherwise unremarkable.\nPhysical examination revealed multiple dry ulcers with 1–2 cm diameter on the left leg with a low skin temperature , and the pulse of the left dorsalis pedis artery was weak. No enlarged surface lymph nodes were palpable. Color Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) angiography , and arteriography  indicated that the left external iliac artery was obstructed and that the right common iliac–external iliac artery had multiple mixed plaques with a cavity that had narrowed by 60%–70%. Based on the patient’s clinical manifestations and imaging findings, the diagnosis of ASO was confirmed.\nThe patient was treated with interventional therapy; two stents (10 mm×8 cm and 8 mm×8 cm) were implanted into the left iliac artery. Angiography showed a significant improvement, with normal blood flow in the region of the left iliac artery stenosis . By 10 days postoperatively, the leg ulcers had healed, the leg pain had disappeared, and the skin temperature had returned to normal .\nASO is characterized by lower extremity ischemia that causes intermittent claudication, pain while resting, and gangrene. Lower extremity ASO significantly affects 17% of people aged 55–75 years worldwide.1 Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary. Risk factors for ASO include older age, male sex, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and hyperhomocysteinemia.2 The clinical symptoms and severity of ASO are related to the location, degree, speed, and range of the vessel blockage, embolization formation, and collateral circulation establishment. Therefore, its clinical manifestations are variable, and this may lead to misdiagnosis or mistreatment. A decreased skin temperature and numbness and intermittent claudication of the affected limbs can occur in the early stage. As the disease progresses, the toes, feet, and lower leg may develop persistent pain at rest, embolization, ulceration, and dry gangrene; however, multiple ulcers are rare.\nEarly diagnosis can be achieved by color Doppler ultrasound, arteriography, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT angiography. Balloon angioplasty procedures and stent implantations yield immediate positive results and have thus become the main approaches to treat ASO.1 However, some studies have revealed that about 30%–50% of patients develop post-angioplasty restenosis within 1 year after the procedure and that 12% of patients develop severe ischemia and eventually require amputation.3,4 The prognosis of ASO is closely related to complications; about 70%–80% of the patients with lower extremity ASO die of cardiovascular disease.删除4：<u>5</u>\nThe clinical manifestations in the present case were multiple leg ulcers and pain at rest; gangrene was absent and therefore can be easily misdiagnosed as vasculitis. The causes of multiple ulcers are still under investigation, and we speculate that good collateral circulation reconstruction of the lower extremities after occlusions of a lower limb artery is an important condition for multiple leg ulcers. ASO is not uncommon in clinical practice, but its pathogenesis and clinical manifestations are complex. Reliance on a dermatologist alone to make the diagnosis is difficult; instead, the joint efforts of clinicians from multiple disciplines, including cardiovascular imaging physicians and radiologists, are necessary for an accurate clinical diagnosis.\nThe authors thank Dr. Shuo-Yi Ma and Dr. Cui-Hua Gao for their help on the imaging images preparation and Dr. Xi-Bao Zhang for his help on manuscript editing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Binding of FⅦ to tissue factor (TF) is related to the metastatic potential of tumor cells, also a significant risk factor in the development of hepatic metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). It has been found that some cancer cells can produce FⅦ extrahepatically. However, litte is known about FⅦ and CRC. We therefore hypothesized that CRC cells may synthese FⅦ, leading to tumor invasion and metastasis.Methods We detected the expression of FⅦ protein in 55 CRC specimens by immunohistochemical staining. The FⅦ mRNA in 45 of 55 CRC cases, 6 colon cancer cell lines and one hepatoma cell line was measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Transwell invasion assays were performed to evaluate the changes of cell migration and invasion of LoVo cancer cells in vitro. We further observed the likely effectors regulated by the TF/FⅦa complex Western blotting assay.Results Extrahepatic synthesis of FⅦ was detected in the cytoplasm of 32 (58.2%) CRC specimens byimmunohistochemistry, but not in normal mucosa. Liver metastasis (P=0.003) and TNM staging (P=0.005) were significantly correlated with FⅦ antigen expression. The positive ratios in stages Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ and Ⅳ were 33.3%, 40.0%,52.4% and 87.5%, respectively. The expression of FⅦ mRNA in CRC with hepatic metastasis was significantly higher than CRC without hepatic metastasis (5.33±2.88 vs. 1.47±0.51, P=0.03). Ectopic FⅦa induced a slight increase (1.34-fold) in the number of migrating cells, which was inhibited by the specific TF antibody. The formation of TF/FⅦacomplex resulted in a marked increase in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 (3.5-fold) and MMP-9(4.7-fold) in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner.Conclusions Extrahepatic synthesis of FⅦ by CRC cells may promote tumor invasion and metastasis. MMPs, as downstream effectors of TF/FⅦa signaling, facilitate the development of metastasis in colon cancer。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

PCP can occur in patients without HIV, including those who have undergone organ transplantation, chemotherapy, and/or high-dose corticosteroid therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is also an opportunistic infection in immunocompromized patients, including those undergoing chemotherapy, steroid treatment, transplantation, and individuals with advanced HIV infection.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>\nPCP and IA co-infection in HIV patients has been reported.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> However, only nine cases co-infected with PCP and IA in non-HIV patients are reported.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5,6]</u> Herein, we report a fatal case of PCP and IA co-infection in a patient undergoing high-dose corticosteroid therapy for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\nA 75-year-old woman visited our emergency room (ER) after developing dyspnea over a week. One month earlier, she was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and took corticosteroids (prednisolone 60 mg/day and tapered 10 mg/day). On arrival, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 156/122 mmHg; heart rate 180 beats/min (irregular); respiratory rate 44 breaths/min; oxygen (O2) saturation 56% (on room air); body temperature 37.7°C. Laboratory results revealed severe inflammation as reflected by increased level of highsensitivity C-reactive protein (24.29 mg/dL and white blood cell count [15.340/μL with 89.0% neutrophils]). Tests for influenza antigen, respiratory virus, and bacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (16 and 5 types, respectively) were negative. Tests for P. jirovecii (SEE AMP; Seegene, Seoul, Republic of Korea) and aspergillosis antigen (V Max Molecular devices, San Jose, CA, USA) were performed during ER stay. Initial chest radiography revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and infiltration in both lungs 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse geographic consolidations and GGOs in both lungs as well as two cavitary lesions in both lower lungs 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>.\nShe was admitted to the intensive care unit and empirical treatment for community-acquired pneumonia was initiated with intravenous (IV) piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 8 h and azithromycin 500 mg/day. Considering the possible PCP infection, IV sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was administered with 320 mg trimethoprim every 6 h and methylprednisolone 60 mg/day.\nOn hospital day 3, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilator support were started. Antibiotics were switched to meropenem and levofloxacin. On hospital day 7, fraction of inspiration O2 reduced to 45% and the patient exhibited clinical improvement. Initial serology, PCP PCR, and aspergillus antigen tests were positive, and itraconazole (200 mg/day) was initiated to treat possible chronic cavitary aspergillosis, considering the two cavitary lesions. Followup non-enhanced chest CT revealed newly formed GGOs in the left upper lung and cavitary changes in the previous consolidation in the right middle lobe 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C]</u>.\nOn hospital day 9, bedside bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed due to the patient’s unstable condition. PCP PCR and aspergillus antigen tests were performed using BAL fluid collected from the right middle lobe. On hospital day 11, aspergillosis was reported in BAL fluid cytology 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1D]</u>. Considering cytology and CT results, IA was diagnosed, and the antifungal agent was changed to voriconazole (200 mg twice/day).\nOn hospital day 13, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy and bronchoscopy with BAL were performed in the portion of the right upper lobe to obtain the evidence of PCP. However, the results of BAL fluid cytology (second) only revealed aspergillosis again.\nAfter a few days, her condition deteriorated and her family declined aggressive management, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. On hospital day 15, the results of PCP PCR of the BAL (first) fluid specimen were positive but the fungus culture revealed no growth after 1 and 2 weeks. On hospital day 16, the patient died of multiorgan failure and septic shock.\nPCP and IA co-infection is rare but can be fatal. To our knowledge, our patient is the tenth such case of PCP and IA co-infection in a non-HIV patient. Five of the six cases, including our case, with co-infection who underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation died from progression to acute respiratory failure (mortality rate, ∼83.3%).\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient’s family for publication of these case reports and any accompanying images.

Approximately, 6.1 ~ 10% of the general population in China have CKD, with an even higher risk in people older than 40 years. CKD may be caused by a wide spectrum of diseases.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The common pathological consequences of CKD is renal fibrosis, assessment of the continuous deterioration of renal fibrosis is important.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Renal biopsy is unsurprisingly the golden standard to determine the degree of renal fibrosis in patients; however, it is an invasive method and inconformity for repeatedly monitoring the progression of fibrosis in clinical follow-up, and it remains challenging to establish a noninvasive biomarker to monitor the progression or regression of renal fibrosis in substitute of biopsy.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could provide both high spatial resolution and excellent tissue contrast in evaluating morphologic alteration in CKD. Moreover, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) MRI has showed more promising results in assessing renal function.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> The commonly used quantitative parameter to interpret DWI is apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value. ADC is calculated by fitting the signal intensities (SIs) from a series of DWI with different diffusion weightings (b values) using a monoexponential model. Previous reports revealed that the CKD patients have significantly lower ADC values in the cortex and medulla,通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> and found that ADC was able to assess the degree of renal fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction murine models.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>\nIn 1986, Le Bihan et al. introduced the principles of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM).通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The concept leads to a more dedicated approach to enable tissue diffusivity and microperfusion to be quantitatively estimated separately. It could be speculated that additional information about microperfusion and tubular flow obtained with IVIM DWI may be especially helpful to evaluate the progress of renal fibrosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\nThe study aims to evaluate the potential of T2-weighted SI and DWI with mono-and bi-exponential models to reflect the serial changes of both morphology and function on cisplatin (CP) induced rodent renal fibrosis models with reference to the corresponding pathological observations.\nThis study was approved by Animal Care and Use Committee, Tianjin Medical University Hospital. A total of 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats (Beijing University Health Science Center) weighted 226 ± 25 g were used. Renal fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of CP solution (QILU Pharmaceutical Company Shandong, China, Batch Number:WA2A1210071) 4.5 mg kg−1 day−1 in 2 consecutive days. After injection, rats were marked and raised in clean plastic cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled facility with a constant 12 h light/dark cycle. All rats showed intoxication symptoms including fatigued, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and weight losing especially during the 1st week after CP injection. Nine rats died from serious diarrhea (n = 6) or anesthetic accident (n = 3), finally 36 rats enrolled in the present study. The rats were randomly selected to undergo MR scanning immediately before (n = 21) and 2 days (n = 24), 4 days (n = 24), 6 days (n = 23), 8 days (n = 18), 2 weeks (n = 11), 3 weeks (n = 8) and 4 weeks (n = 6) after CP injection.\nMR examination was performed on a 3.0T scanner (MR750, GE Company, US) using an 5 cm inner diameter animal coil (Magtron, China) under a stable anesthetized condition by intramuscular injection of 2% pentobarbital sodium solution (0.15 ml/100 g weight). Rats were fasting but free of drinking 2 h before MR exam and respiratory movement was restricted by proper compression on the abdominal region. Coronal fat suppressed fast recovery fast spin echo T2-weighted images were acquired with following parameters: Repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) 3182.6 ms/94.1 ms, matrix 352 × 352, field of view 6.0 cm, thickness 2.0 mm, spacing 0.5 mm, bandwidth ± 83.3 kHz, two signal averaged with a total acquisition time of 4 min 44 s. Axial multisection single shot-echo planar imaging (EPI) DWI was acquired with the following parameters: TR/TE 2075/111.9 ms; 10 sections coving both kidney regions, section thickness 2 mm, intersection spacing 0.5 mm, field of view 6.0 cm, matrix 192 × 96, bandwidth ± 100 kHz. The following 13 diffusion gradient b values were used: 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 140, 180, 240, 300, 500, 1000 and 1500 s/mm2, the gradients were applied in three orthogonal directions and subsequently averaged to minimize the effects of diffusion anisotropy. The numbers of signal average gradually rose from 2 to 8 along with the increasing b value; the acquisition time was 2 min 45 s.\nThe MRI data series was transferred to an offline workstation (ADW4.5, GE Company, US). Both morphologic changes and functional changes were evaluated on the workstation singly by two radiologists with 15-year and 3-year experience in urogenital imaging respectively.\nThe morphologic changes of the renal parenchyma were evaluated on coronal T2WI. Besides visual inspection, the regions of interest (ROI) were placed free-hand on entire regions of renal cortex (CO), the outer stripe of the outer medulla (OM) and the inner stripe of the inner medulla (IM) at the middle coronal section of bilateral kidneys and average SI were measured. To reflect the signal changes on T2WI, T2-weighted standardized SIs were obtained by calculating the ratios between the average SIs of each of the three stripes and SI of homolateral psoas major.\nFunctional data of DWI were analyzed using Microsoft Data Access Components (MADC) software in the functiontools package installed in the workstation. Both monoexponential model (equation 1) and biexponential model (equation 2) were used on the same multiple b value DWI data series.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>\nS 通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u> is the SI in DWI for b = 0 (b0). S (b) is the SI in a serial of DWI acquired by different b values. ADC maps were generated on renal parenchyma pixel-by-pixel by fitting the SIs with corresponding b values to a monoexponential decay model. Biexponential model yielded three parameters: f refers to the ratio of flow content in the entire volume, it reflects tissue microvasculature as well as tubular flow; D reflects pure diffusion coefficient and is sensitive to microstructural barriers, which limit slow water molecular movement; D* indicates pseudodiffusivity of fast water molecular movement which is sensitive to flow velocity.\nAfter ADC, f, D and D* maps were generated, ROIs of entire CO, OM and IM stripes were plotted on the renal helium section according on the b = 0 images and transferred to the maps. The average value of ADC, f, D and D* of the three stripes were measured on bilateral kidneys respectively.\nFive rats were randomly scarified after MRI examination accomplished at each time point after CP administration. Both kidneys were harvested for histopathological examination. The specimens were fixed in 5% buffered formalin and processed, then cut serially into 5 mm thickness section, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin pathological findings including tubules swelling and necrosis, inflammation cells infiltration in tubulointerstitium and the progression of renal fibrosis was assessed visually by an experienced pathologist.\nResults are presented as mean ± standard deviation. The measurements of bilateral kidneys in each subject were analyzed for discrepancies by paired student t-test. The Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to evaluate the reliability between the observers and the average values. The measured parameters on bilateral kidneys by the two observers were then averaged. The data were analyzed by the way of independent sample t-test among different time points. The discrepancies among each time point were statically analyzed on CO, OM and IM stripes respectively. For all statistical tests, a P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Product and Service Solutions(SPSS) software 12.0.1 and Microsoft Office Excel 2003 workbook (Microsoft Company).\nThere was no significant difference in all the measurement between bilateral kidneys on all the three stripes (n = 675, P = 0.94). Interobserver agreement ICCs were ranged from 0.66 to 0.99 for OM, 0.73–0.99 for CO and 0.76–0.98 for IM.\nCortex (2.35 ± 0.40) and OM (2.35 ± 0.40) couldn’t be distinguished between each other, and IM showed relative hyperintense (3.13 ± 0.61) prior to CP injection. Two days after CP injection, OM began to appear as a hyperintense stripe (3.78 ± 0.72, P < 0.05) with distinct boundaries with CO and IM; then it gradually broadened and became less intense with transit downward fluctuation but beyond normal level during 4th day and 4th week (P < 0.05), consequently it shrink to be an obscure thread 4 weeks after CP injection. CO revealed slightly increased intensity (2.60 ± 0.41, P < 0.05) at the 2nd days after injection, then decreased to normal level (2.28 ± 0.51, P > 0.05) 2 days later then appeared as steady hyperintense thereafter (P < 0.05). IM showed the transit and moderate hypointense (2.52 ± 0.72, P < 0.05) at only 4th day 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1 and Figure 2]</u>.\nMean ADC values of all the CO, OM and IM decreased firstly and then kept increasing since the 4th day. The mean ADC values of OM were higher than normal subject (4.38 ± 0.63 × 10−4 mm2/s vs. 4.91 ± 0.56 × 10−4 mm2/s, P < 0.05), while the ADC values of CO were similar to normal level (5.7 ± 0.79 × 10−4 mm2/s, P > 0.05) since the 6th day. The changes of ADC values for OM and CO tended to be stable during the 6th and 4th week (P > 0.05). In IM, excepted for the 4th week (4.33 ± 0.93 × 10−4 mm2/s, P = 0.07), mean ADC values were significant lower than normal subjects (5.23 ± 1.05 × 10−4 mm2/s) at all time points (P < 0.05) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3a]</u>.\nThe f values of all the CO, OM and IM stripes decreased after CP injection and were below normal level all the time (P < 0.05), and the changes in OM were more remarkable 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3b]</u>. The slow recovery of f values were seen as early as 4th day in IM, then 6th in CO, but f values in OM kept decreasing till 8th day before going steadily upward (P < 0.05).\nD values of CO, OM and IM stripes, on the contrary to f values, had a tendency to increase in spite of some downward fluctuations 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3c]</u>; however, changes on CO and OM were not significant at all time points when compared with healthy kidneys (CO: mean 0.31 ± 0.28 × 10−3 mm2/s; OM: 1.04 ± 0.80 × 10−3 mm2/s) (P > 0.05). D values of IM kept increasing till the 2nd week as in Figure 3c, then turned back to normal level; however, the difference between each time point and healthy kidney (1.12 ± 1.51 × 10−3 mm2/s) wasn’t significant (P > 0.05), resulting from the standard deviations of D values on IM were large at all the time points.\nD* values of CO, OM and IM stripes has a similar upward trend at the 2nd day, and then tended to be steady thereafter till the 3rd week 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3d]</u>. At all the time points except for 4th week, D* values of three stripes were significant higher than healthy kidneys (P < 0.05). Mean D* values of IM (7.33 ± 3.99 × 10−2 mm2/s) were higher than CO (2.50 ± 2.13 × 10−2 mm2/s and OM (3.77 ± 2.47 × 10−2 mm2/s) in healthy kidneys (P < 0.05).\nAt the 2nd and 4th day after CP injection, the epitheliums of renal tubules showed obviously cell swelling and tubules narrowing, and OM stripes which was consisting of proximal convoluted tubules demonstrated the most remarkable changes 通用删除8(英):<u>[refer to the acute stage, Figure 4a]</u>. During the 6th and 8th day, cell swelling relieved while cell turbidity and renal tubular mold could be observed, massive inflammation cells began to infiltrate in the interstitium 通用删除8(英):<u>[refer to the chronic stage, Figure 4b and c]</u>. Renal interstitial fibrosis was initially observed at 2nd week; tubular atrophy and necrosis, broadened interstitial space with proliferation of myofibroblasts and cellular density increasing could be demonstrated throughout the fibrotic process after the 3rd week 通用删除8(英):<u>[refer to the fibrosis stage, Figure 4d]</u>.\nFrom the findings of this longitudinal study, all of T2-weighted SI, ADC value, and biexponential parameters showed variations that agree with pathologic observations. Unlike human and swine kidneys, which are multilubular in anatomic structure, rodent kidneys are unilobular, this is ideal to delineating among different anatomic regions. Rodent kidney parenchyma is divided into four stripes: CO contains all glomeruli and their corresponding proximal convoluted tubules, OM is mainly occupied by the tortuous proximal convoluted tubules, IM is consisting of descending thin limbs and thick ascending limbs, and the inner medulla stripe is occupied by renal collecting ducts.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Rodent renal fibrosis models have been successfully induced by administration of CP in a large number of histopathologic studies. CP is a widely used antineoplastic agent, but associated with nephrotoxicity, and prone to result in long-term renal fibrosis after administration, the damages involve both glomeruli and tubules, while the major damage happens in proximal convoluted tubules.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> The pathologic changes of inner medulla in CKD is minor, true but without shown in the present study, the inner medulla is isointense to renal pelvis which makes it difficult to be delineated; hence the analysis of inner medulla is neglected in the study.\nThe standardized T2-weighted SIs that are sensitive to tissue edema and necrosis were introduced in this study to evaluate morphological changes of renal fibrosis. The elevated T2-weighted SI, predominately seen on OM in the early stage implied the happening of acute cytotoxic edema and tubular necrosis that was proved histopathologically. However, T2-weighted SIs were then going in a steady state that was inconsistent with fibrotic progression. Similar observation was described by Hueper et al. on acute kidney injury mice,通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> suggesting T2-weighted SI could not stand alone by itself to be a biomarker of renal fibrosis.\nSeveral investigators have reported decreased ADC in both cortex and medulla in CKD patients or renal fibrosis animal model compared with normal subjects.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,12,13]</u> The ADC values of cortex and medulla after CP administration were initially decreased as expected, however, both CO and OM had a tendency to increase and were higher than that of normal kidney since 6 days after CP injection, at times inflammation and fibrosis were observed. This phenomenon is controversial with most of the published data; the elevation of ADC values in diseased tissues was described in few reports with increased microperfusion.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> The ADC values behaved as a weight of the pure diffusion and pseudodiffusion, pure diffusion restriction was mainly depending on the cellularity which was increasing during fibrogenic process,通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> hence the increasing of pseudodiffusion should be responsible for the ADC upward alteration.\nIntravoxel incoherent motion is capable of separating pure diffusion and microperfusion theoretically, which is beneficial beyond simple ADC in oncology imaging and functional imaging. The model hypothesizes that the tissue signal decay in vivo might be divided into flow-dependent fast decay and flow independent slow decay, which makes it particularly meaningful in evaluating renal diseases.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> The water movement within extracellular space is modeled as pure diffusivity when DWI are acquired with higher b value (over 600–800 s/mm2), while the microapillary perfusion and tubular flow are classified as pseudodiffusion, which is predominant with low b values (under 100–200 s/mm2). Recent studies demonstrated the capability of IVIM in differencing subtypes of renal tumors.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Zhang et al. showed that the biexponential parameters were more accurate than monoexponential ADC in healthy volunteers.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nAmong of three parameters in biexponential model, f fraction of all stripes showed early decreasing and subsequent recovering process. F fraction referred to the proportion of fast flow contents in overall diffusion effect. Therefore, the decrease of f value indicated both the lessened capillary vasculature and narrowed renal tubular which is coincident with pathology. Meanwhile, the D values of CO, OM and IM had a tendency to increase after CP injection but failed to demonstrate significant alterations during the period of observation. The steady state of D values were also observed in some but disagree with the majority of published data, and it agreed with our previous study on unilateral ureteral obstruction rat model, which demonstrating increased D value along with time.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Pure diffusivity was also affected by a number of imaging factors including signal to noise ratios, registration artifacts, field strength, imaging sequence, and parameters, as well as the b value setting.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,18]</u> However, it wouldn’t interfere with a longitudinal study design like ours, the reason of D value increasing instead of decreasing during renal fibrosis was unclear and under investigation. D* values of all stripes increased after CP injection, and the mean D* values of IM were higher than the others. The pseudodiffusion D* of the renal parenchyma depends on both microperfusion and tubular flow, the elevated D* value suggested either increased microcirculation or faster renal tubular flow. Ebrahimi et al. suggested that D* mainly depended on the velocity of tubular fluid instead of microperfusion in the kidney by correlated IVIM parameters with computed tomography perfusion parameters on swine model.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> According to the pathological observation, with the progressing of renal fibrosis, destroy, and atrophy of renal tubular was common seen, then tubular flow velocities would increase as compensating and repairing mechanisms, which were intermingled together. A higher D* in IM implied that there existed faster tubular fluid flow in descending and ascending limbs than proximal convoluted tubules, which was rational on the basis of renal physiology.\nThe study had some limitations. Because of intrinsic distortion of EPI, separately analysis of the stripes prone to error because of small ROI size; large variations might have prevented the achievement of statistical significance. The ridicules that makeup of proximal convoluted tubules extends from OM to CO had blurred the boundary between them, hence the arbitrarily ROI delineating between OM And CO leading the large variations of parameters. A more robust Gaussian distribution model and auto segmentation techniques might be helpful in further investigation. Although the present data rendering the feasibility that the microperfusion together with tubular dynamics might be evaluated using biexponential models, they couldn’t be separated from each other by IVIM method. Finally, the study is lack of evidence of specific pathologic finding for renal fibrosis such as cellularity counting and assessment of microperfusion and tubular dynamics alterations, a correlation study with IVIM parameters would be more convincing in future study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Higher incidences of BBLAs have been reported among women, on the right side, in younger patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), associated hypertension and arteriosclerosis, or dissection of the internal carotid artery (ICA) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u>. Their bulging appearance with a broad base ostium indicates a \"sick\" carotid wall segment differing from the overall group of saccular aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. BBLAs of the ICA account for about 0.3–1 % of intracranial aneurysms or 0.9–6.5 % of ICA aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\nBBLAs are thin and fragile hemispherical bulges and can progress into a saccular shape. They are at high risk of recurrent hemorrhage no matter their shape or the treatment modality chosen 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. These lesions account for 0.5–2.0 % of ruptured intracranial aneurysms and prelude unusually high morbidity and mortality rates compared with typical ruptured saccular aneurysms of the ICA 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. A high degree of suspicion for this lesion is recommended in SAH of unknown origin, particularly when the bleeding pattern is more typical for an ICA source 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. However, similar lesions can be found at lower frequencies in other areas of the basal cerebral circulation (e.g. in the basilar artery) 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u>. Because these lesions are often not true aneurysms but rather pseudoaneurysms with a high incidence of thin and fragile walls and lack a definable neck, they are extremely difficult to treat surgically. This difficulty is reflected by a high incidence of intraoperative rupture and postoperative hemorrhage, resulting in significant disability and mortality from surgical repair 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\nAlthough endovascular techniques have revolutionized the treatment of aneurysms in general, these blister-like aneurysms present a challenge because of their small size, wide necks, and fragile nature. Treating these aneurysms surgically is usually not a problem, but surgeons are often faced with a hole in the carotid when the aneurysm disin-tegrates during dissection通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.BBLAs are uncommon and their management is subsequently based on what little has been published. The angiographic diagnosis of BBLAs may be difficult because they often represent tiny lesions that can be overlooked, mistaken for artifacts or focal atheromatous irregularity, or missed completely due to overlap of vessel curvature 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Repeat angiography often documents luminal changes or growth of these lesions.\nIn many patients with this particular type of aneurysm, soon after subarachnoid hemorrhage, the initial angiogram shows only a small bulge, which may progress to a saccu-lar appearance within a few weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Exact pathogenesis of BBLA is unknown, but several autopsy studies suggest that BBLA is not a true saccular aneurysm but a specific type of pseudoaneurysm and that a small ulceration penetrating the internal elastic lamina and the resulting wall defect is crucial in BBLA development. Others suggest that BBLA is specifically a type 4 dissection with focal defect of the internal elastic lamina mimicking a penetrating ulceration without a coexisting intramural hematoma, a condition similar to BBLA 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\nA 68-year-old male suffering from acute headache for 4 days presented to the emergency department of Guangxi Medical University. The patient was alert on physical examination, muscle tension grade 5 in all limbs, and both pupils were same size of 3 mm and sensitive to pupillary light reflex. The neck was slightly stiff on examination, and Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's sign were slightly positive. Emergent CT scan was carried out showing SAH . The patient was then admitted to the neurosurgery department where computed tomography angiography (CTA) was carried out revealing similar results to CT scan in addition to right C7 (communicating artery) segment right internal carotid artery aneurysm of size 2.3 mm × 2.8 mm . No other aneurysms or vascular malformations could be noted to relate the cause of SAH. SAH Hunt and Huss Grade II, without focal neurological deficit, were noticed. Severity of the disease, complications, risks, and therapeutic options were clearly discussed with family members and the patient. Cons of endovascular treatment outweighed pros due to its broad base and small and fusiform morphology. A final decision of open surgery for aneurysm clipping was made.\nThe patient underwent general anesthesia, and right pterion approach was chosen. Direct exposure of a 2 mm × 1.5 mm bulge at the bifurcation of internal carotid artery (ICA) and posterior communicating artery (PCA) and signs of arteriosclerosis (yellowish plaques) could be seen . Blister-like appearance, thin wall, clear hemodynamics could be seen at the lesion wall. A 10-ml hematoma was present at the proximity of bifurcation of these two arteries .\nA temporary clip was inserted on the victim's artery and the vision cleared for proper exposure. Debridement of the hematoma was carried out when suddenly the blood blister-like aneurysm ruptured and a \"hole\" could be seen . There was spontaneous bleeding and another temporary clip was inserted to prevent blood loss. The ruptured vessel wall was exposed, and a permanent clip was attempted several times in different angles but all in vain as there was no proper grip of the clip . Vessel reconstruction was attempted and vessel wall of the tear was approximated by three 8/0 Prolene sutures and total temporary clipping time of 22 min. The temporary clips were carefully released one at a time, and blood flow was monitored . The artery was properly dilated with no blood leakage noticed. Surgical vision was rinsed with NS, and intraoperative fluorescein angiography showed no vessel obstruction . The patient was regularly followed with cranial CTs, and no cerebral infarction or other complications were detected . The patient did fairly well after surgery, but because the patient lives 440 km from our institute, we contacted the patient 9 months after surgery and evaluation using modified Rankin scale score was 3 at 8 months after surgery (moderate disability).\nSundth and Murphey were the first to describe the lesions at non-branching sites on internal carotid artery (ICA). Preoperative diagnosis of BBLA is very challenging, and angiographic findings do not always correlate with the intraoperative features. BBLA might be one of the causes of angiogram-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), particularly when the distribution of blood on computed tomography (CT) is non-perimesencephalic通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. So, in many cases of SAH, the first angiographic findings of CTA or even digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are negative or suspicious and repeated exams must be done 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Short-term angiography follow-up (10 days) may show a dramatic change in the conformation of these lesions with reasons attributed to the profound weakness of the aneurysmal wall 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Recently, the use of CTA as a first-line diagnostic tool has been advocated on the basis of comparable sensitivity and specificity to DSA even for small aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Blood blister-like aneurysms are most correctly diagnosed when proper visualization of the aneurysm is obtained intraoperatively.\nTreatment options for BBLA include conservative, endovascular treatment and surgical treatment. Although several strategies in each subgroup have been attempted by centers across the globe, no consensus has been reached for the safest treatment modality because clinical outcomes have generally remained poor通用删除6(英):<u>[5,18]</u>. Table 1 shows a review of previous cases in literature reporting in-traoperative microsuture cases; note must be taken that many of these cases employed microsuture as a rescue treatment after intraoperative rupture of aneurysm. The ideal treatment outcome is blister-like aneurysm repair with parent artery preservation. However, due to patient preference, open surgery was opted in our present case and intraoperative rupture of aneurysm occurred.\nReview of reported intraoperative aneurysm microsuture cases\n删除重复语句：<u>Review of reported intraoperative aneurysm microsuture cases</u>\nAs we can see from Table 1, male to female ratio is 2:1, age distribution of 14–68 years old (mean age of 43 years old). Seven out of these 9 cases (77.8 %) were from the right side, and right supraclinoid ICA aneurysms seem to be more common. 8/0 Prolene sutures were preferred for suturing, and average time of temporary clipping of ICA was 26 min. All the BBLA in this review was intraoperatively ruptured and then sutured. No reports of rebleeding or recurrence were noted, and the postoperative outcomes were good except in one case where the patient died M male, F female, WFNS World Federation of Neurosurgeons Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) Grading System, H&H Hunt and Hess SAH Scale, FISHER Fisher SAH Grade, GOS Glasgow Outcome Scale, mRs modified Rankin scale, NM not mentioned, CTA computed tomography angiography, DSA digital subtraction angiography\nKojra et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> concluded that stent-assisted coil embolization is not a treatment of choice for BBLA but only an option. Parker at al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> concluded that endovascular coiling of BBLA cannot be recommended as a treat-ment strategy due to high rates of procedural rupture (75 %), aneurysmal regrowth, and rebleeding. Maling et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> further discouraged endovascular treatment as 11 out of 14 of their patients were judged unsuitable in BBLA treatment. There are no randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses to compare the endovascular and surgical treatments of BBLA, therefore making it difficult to en-courage any particular treatment plan. Moreover, to date, all the present cases in literature used microsuturing as the rescue treatment of BBLA.\nVarious surgical strategies have been developed to fight against BBLA, including parallel clip placement along the ICA wall producing mild st enosis, clipping on wrapping methods, trapping with or without extracranialintracranial bypass surgery, and suturing methods. Most surgical case series reported that BBLA had a worse outcome than usual ruptured saccular aneurysms. The BBLA wall is fragile; direct clipping of the aneurysm neck is danger-ous and likely to cause premature rupture during surgical manipulation 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\nFrom our review of literature, as illustrated in Table 1, we noticed that suturing was used as a rescue plan when BBLAs ruptured intraoperatively. Postoperative angiography showed no vessel stenosis in four patients but two patients had vessel spasm. DSA was the preferred follow-up tool to re-evaluate patient after BBLA rupture and suture. Gonzalez 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> carried a systemic review of sur-gically treated blood blister-like aneurysms, and out of 165 patients with clipping, 39 (23 %) needed rescue treatment. Out of these 39 patients, 10 (25.6 %) patients received ar-terial microsuture. This shows that arterial microsuture is a fundamental technique for neurovascular surgeons. Suturing has been infamous because of the lack of experience, fragile muscle wall, bleeding, prolonged ische-mic time, and uncertain outcomes. Suturing methods and surgical handlings can be difficult because of the limited space and time. Yanaka et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> agreed that aneurysmal rupture requiring arterial suture does not occur often, but a proper strategy to address such problems can make a difference in bringing a good neurological outcome out of an intraoperative catastrophe. They suggest that deep field suturing required long microsuture forceps and long microneedle holder, and these instruments must be pre-pared and available in the operating room. However, there are certain limitations to this technique, such as excessive vessel laceration, making suturing cause too much stenosis and extensive circumferential carotid disease. Joo et al. attempted suturing in a patient after sev-eral failed attempts of failed clipping, but the follow-up DSA demonstrated internal carotid artery occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. In such cases, parent vessel occlusion and bypass can be considered.\nIn conclusion, BBLAs are rare but very unpredictable lesions. Proper teamwork between the neurosurgeon and interventional neuroradiologist can improve efficacy of treatment. Angiogram-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage patients must be suspected of BBLA and 3D CTA (in preference to 2D DSA) or 3D DSA (in preference to 3D CTA) can be repeated about 10 days after initial SAH. Intraoperative rupture of BBLA is very common, and we here report that arterial microsuture can be a good reliable rescue treatment. Also, in many medical centers as ours, there is no wide variety of stents and encircling clips are not available; suturing is the very practical in these situations as a lifesaving procedure. We therefore strongly suggest that any medical institution providing surgical treatment op-tion for aneurysmal treatment should have team members well trained in arterial microsuturing techniques and should have readily available long microsuture forceps and long microsuture needle holders.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this report and any accompanying images\nThe authors declare they have no competing interests.\nConception and design: RG, DZW.

We assessed glycaemic control in the real-life practice among people with T2DM in metropolises in China who were treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) alone and to determine factors associated with inadequate giycaemic control in this population.Methods An observational, cross-sectional multicentre study was conducted in 16 metropolitan medical centers.People with T2DM who had been followed-up before the index visit which occurred from January to September 2007 were included in the study. All subjects were ≥30 years of age at the time of T2DM diagnosis and had received monotherapy or combination therapy of OAD for at least 6 months. Demographic and clinical data were collected from medical records. The main study outcome was the inadequate glucose control rate, which was calculated by the proportion of patients with haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5% detected on the index visit.Results In this cohort of 455 patients with T2DM whose mean age was 60.6 years and mean disease duration was 6.1 years, 45.5% had inadequate glycaemic control. The mean (SD) HbA1c was 6.7% (1.3). Multivariate Logistic regression showed that physical inactivity, disease duration ＞10 years, body mass index (BMI) ≥24 kg/m2, low homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) index, less frequency of medical visit and hypertriglyceridaemia were independent determinants of inadequate glycaemic control. Higher incidence of self-reported hypoglycemia experience (47.1% vs. 34.8%, P=0.008) and more fear of hypoglycemia quantified by Worry subscaie of the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey (HFS) Ⅱ were happened in subjects with good glycemic control.Conclusion Approximately one half of these outpatients with T2DM from the metropolitan medical centers in China had inadequate glycaemic control treated with OAD alone, which raises the need for more effective educational and therapeutic approaches on management of hypertriglycemia, enhancing physical exercise and weight control, and at the same time, lowering the hypoglycemic risk and diminishing the hypoglycemic fear of patients。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Patients can be protected from poor outcomes though appropriate surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5,6,7,8]</u>, for the limitation of medical sources, a notable part of patients cannot receive treatment as soon as they are sent to hospital. Considering that rebleeding occurs most within 6 h after the initial hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,9]</u>, it is meaningful to establish a model, through which the ruptured intracranial aneurysms (RIAs) with a high risk of rebleeding could be quickly identified.\nThere are two main aspects related to the stability of intracranial aneurysms, known as the pathological characteristics of aneurysm wall 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> and the hemodynamic characteristics of aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13]</u>. Considering the strong correlation between pathological characteristics of aneurysm wall and morphological features 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>, we established a nomogram model based on clinical and morphological factors (hypertension, bifurcation, irregular shape, and aspect ratio) to identify the RIAs with a high risk of rebleeding after admission 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. However, the predictive accuracy was not validated by other independent cohorts.\nIn this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics of patients with RIA from two medical centers and the morphology of RIAs. The aim of this study was to validate the predictive accuracy of \"clinical + morphological nomogram.\"\nWe retrospectively reviewed the patients with RIAs in Beijing Tiantan Hospital and Beijing and Peking University International Hospital from December 2020 to September 2021. As is presented in Fig. 1, patients were selected according to the following standards: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> a CTA (computational tomography angiogram) was performed after initial hemorrhage; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the patients were sent to our institution within 12 h as soon as the occurrence of symptoms, e.g. when an acute headache or a sudden coma occurred; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> clinical records were complete, or clinical history could be traced. We further excluded the patients who 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> had other intracranial tumors, angiostenosis or angio-malformation, e.g. meningioma or arteriovenous malformation; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> had a family history of intracranial aneurysm; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> had multiple intracranial aneurysms, because it would make it difficult to identify the source of bleeding or rebleeding; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> had dissection, thrombus or traumatic aneurysms; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> received special treatment for RIA in other medical institutions before admitted to our institution.\nOnce patients were admitted to the medical institutions, they would receive standard medical care, including acute pressure lowering and intensive medical monitoring, followed by the guideline and recommendation 通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u>. The target of blood pressure was to lower their systolic pressure to 120-140 mmHg.\nAfter initial hemorrhage, patients with Hunt-Hess I-II would receive a surgical intervention within 72 h, who could not benefit from immediate surgical treatment; therefore, we would just give these patients conservative treatment until the Hunt-Hess grade \"degraded\" ; however, once patients’ condition progressively deteriorated, an emergency surgical intervention would be performed. In addition, for patients with Hunt-Hess V, surgical treatment would not be recommended.\nClinical information was collected from electronical medical records regarding to age, gender, comorbidities (including hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and ischemic stroke), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage history, Hunt-Hess grade at admission, time from admission to rebleeding (time from admission to neurological symptoms) or surgery as well as blood pressure at admission and before rebleeding/surgery. The time interval from admission to rebleeding or surgery was recorded. Modified Fisher scale (mFS) and IA site were collected based on radiological data.\nThe digital imaging and communications on medicine data of CTA performed after admission were collected and converted into reordered slices (about 0.5 mm per slice). The DICOM data was introduced into Mimics 17.0 (Mimics Research 17.0, Materialize, Belgium) and reconstructed for further studies.\nThe measurement of morphological parameters was performed by the same neurosurgeons (PJ.J. and J.W.) based on the vascular model. The discrepancies were solved by consulting a senior neuro-interventionist (HW.H.). Aneurysm size (S), diameter of dome (D), perpendicular height (H), diameter of parent artery, vessel angle (VA), aneurysm inclination angle (AA), volume, and surface area were measured here 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. The parameters mentioned were measured twice by two investigators, the average of whose measurements was taken for further analyses. Aspect ratio (AR), size ratio (SR), undulation index (UI), and nonsphericity index (NSI) were calculated 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. An irregular shape was identified according to our previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\nThe nomogram points were calculated based on hypertension, AR and bifurcation site, which were then transferred into risk probability or rebleeding according to our previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The risk probability of rebleeding was used for further analyses.\nIn this study, rebleeding was diagnosed based on two aspects: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the patients had a sudden disorder of consciousness, a gradually worsening neurological state or convulsion after admission, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the magnitude of subarachnoid, intracerebral or intraventricular blood significantly increased in immediate CTs compared with that at admission, and the magnitude of bleeding did not increase or kept stable at/before admission. Rebleeding was confirmed by experienced neurosurgeons (S.W.) according to the bleeding presentation on medical record and CT after admission.\nThe patients suffering from rebleeding were categorized as the rebleeding group, otherwise the stable group.\nCategorical variables were presented as numbers (n) and percentage (%). Continuous variables with a normal distribution were presented as means and standard deviation, and medians (m) as well as inter-quartile range (IQR) if possible. We compared the differences between continuous variables of the two groups based on Student’s t tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests as well as the differences in categorical variables based on chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests. The clinical + morphological nomogram was given in our previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>; the risk of rebleeding after admission was calculated, meanwhile PHASES score and ELAPSS score were calculated according to previous protocols 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u>. The parameters with significance in univariable analysis were input into Cox regression model to identify the independent risk factors, whose result was presented as hazard ratio (HR) and a confidence interval of 95% (CI). A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, the SPSS 24.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was adopted for statistical analyses, and a two-sided P < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.\nA calibration curve was derived to assess the calibration of the actual rebleeding percentage through the model. The nomogram was subjected to bootstrapping validation (1000 bootstrap resamples). The predictive accuracy of the model while predicting rebleeding was measured by the area under the curve (AUCs) through receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses. The models with AUC > 0.7 were considered as useful models for clinical work.\nThis study finally included 138 patients with RIAs, 20 (14.5%) of whom suffered from rebleeding after admission . The information of patients and RIAs was summarized in Table 1. For all patients, within those whose age ranged from 21 to 77 years, 57 (41.3%) were male and 47 (34.1%) had a hypertension history. Sixtyfive (47.1%) RIAs sited in the internal carotid artery, 49 were (25.5%) in the middle cerebral artery, and 24 (17.4%) sited in other sites.\nThe significance was found in gender (P = 0.002), hypertension (P = 0.033), irregular shape (P = 0.009), bifurcation (P < 0.001), aneurysm size (P = 0.005), AA (P = 0.014), AR (P < 0.001), SR (P = 0.018), bottleneck factor (P = 0.014), and height-to-width ratio (P = 0.002). There was no significance in dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, mFS scale, Hunt-Hess grade, locations, dome diameter, height, VA, volume, surface area, or NSI (all P > 0.05).\nThe ELAPSS score was significantly different between rebleeding group and stable group (14 vs. 9, P = 0.009), whereas the PHASES score failed to be significant (2 vs.2, P = 0.237).\nThe result of Cox regression analysis was summarized in Table 2. We performed univariate Cox analyses based on the parameters with significance in univariate analysis. The result showed that hypertension, bifurcation, AR, irregular shape, aneurysm size, AR, SR, bottleneck factor, and height-to-width ratio were risk factors for rebleeding after admission, which were then input into a multivariate model through the backward method. The parameters, including hypertension (HR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.01-6.40; P = 0.047), bifurcation (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.29-11.66; P = 0.016), and AR (HR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.63-4.41; P < 0.001), were demonstrated as independent risk factors related to rebleeding after admission.\nWe further compared the predictive accuracy of independent risk factors, clinical + morphological nomogram, ELAPSS, and PHASES of rebleeding after admission. According to the result of ROC analyses , the nomogram had the highest predictive accuracy (AUC, 0.939, P < 0.001), followed by bifurcation (AUC, 0.735, P = 0.001) and AR (AUC, 0.666, P = 0.018). However, hypertension (AUC, 0.693, P = 0.080) and PHASES score (AUC, 0.577, P = 0.244) could not be used to predict the risk of rebleeding after admission. For the risk of rebleeding after admission, the calibration plot showed a substantial agreement between the prediction by nomogram and the actual observation . To avoid the effect of Hunt-Hess grade and time from admission to rebleeding or surgery, we performed a subgroup analysis, whose result showed that rebleeding RIAs had a higher risk probability in both I-II-grade and III-IV-grade patients 通用删除1(英):<u>(Supplementary Figure 1)</u> on each day 通用删除1(英):<u>(Supplementary Figure 2)</u>.\nRebleeding is a catastrophic event after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. How to identify RIAs with a high risk of rebleeding is helpful to make treatment strategies. This study demonstrated hypertension, bifurcation and AR as independent risk factors related to rebleeding after admission. We validated the predictive accuracy of the clinical + morphological nomogram for the risk of rebleeding.\nHypertension can aggravate the unstable hemodynamic condition of intracranial aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21,22]</u>. In the current study, we found that hypertension could increase the risk of rebleeding after admission, which was consistent with our previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The potential mechanism is that a systematic hypertension can damage the vascular structure and make the vessels fragile 通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23,24]</u>. Such biological effect makes the vessels prone to rupture once an accidental stress occurs.\nIt was also confirmed in this study that the aneurysms sited in bifurcation or with a large AR had a high risk of rebleeding after admission, and that the aneurysms sited in bifurcation had a higher possibility to suffer from the impact of blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>[13,25]</u>. The dynamic change from direct-impact area to surrounding area could cause physical injuries to the aneurysm wall 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The aneurysms with a large AR usually are in an unstable hemodynamic condition with severe damage in aneurysm wall 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. In our preliminary studies, we also found that AR was also a predictor for rebleeding of RIAs 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Based on these facts, bifurcation site and AR could serve as the parameters to identify the RIAs with a high risk of rebleeding after admission.\nIn previous study, we established a nomogram based on clinical and morphological characteristics of RIAs, including hypertension, bifurcation, irregular shape and aspect ratio, which were also confirmed as the independent risk factors for rebleeding in this study. It was revealed in our further analyses that the clinical + morphological nomogram reached a high predictive accuracy, which outperformed independent risk factors, ELAPSS and PHASES model. This model could help neurosurgeons and neuro-interventionists quickly identify the rebleeding risk of RIAs based on CTA, which was also easy to follow and understand. In China, because of a large patient population with limitations of medical resources 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>, it is meaningful to give priority to RIAs with a high risk of rebleeding. Therefore, the clinical + morphological nomogram could assist doctors to make treatment strategies.\nThere were two limitations in the current study. First of all, because of the change in morphology after indiscoverable rebleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> and the effect of hemorrhage on the quality of radiological images, our conclusion may be limited. Secondly, not so many potential factors were considered this study, which might be also related to the risk of rebleeding. Though there are some limitations, this study could also provide the evidence that clinical + morphological nomogram could help doctors to identify the RIAs with a high risk of rebleeding.\nHypertension, bifurcation site, and AR were independent risk factors related to rebleeding of RIAs after admission. The clinical + morphological nomogram could help doctors to identify the high-risk RIAs with a high predictive accuracy.\nSupplementary Figure 1. Subgroup analysis based on Hunt-Hess grade. We performed subgroup analysis based on Hunt-Hess grade, and found that the rebleeding RIAs had higher risk probability in both I-II grade and III-IV grade patients.\nSupplementary Figure 2.

{"seq_id": "4cdf4c82-0dac-4242-93c9-6a504d3e976e", "title": "", "text": "【0】To the Editor: It is reported that the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had longer prothrombin time and higher plasma D-dimer levels compared to those who were not admitted to the ICU. This indicates that these patients had a higher risk of thromboembolism. In addition, plasma tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than those in non-ICU patients, and plasma TNF-α levels, interleukin (IL)-1 levels and IL-8 levels in all infected patients were higher than normal.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The high expression of these inflammatory cytokines indicates that there is an inflammatory response in infected patients, and the inflammatory response is more obvious in severe patients. The findings of thrombus formation and high levels of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients are consistent with those in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) patients. Since 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are all coronaviruses, and their genomic sequences are similar,通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> it can be considered that the thrombogenesis process of COVID-19 patients is similar to that of patients infected with other coronaviruses, as inflammatory factors cause hypercoagulability and lead to thromboembolism. In fact, opposite findings have been reported that there are no significant differences in prothrombin time, accompanied by or regardless of that in D-dimer levels between ICU and non-ICU patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u> We consider this discrepancy as a result of the limited quantity of subjects, and thus believe that a larger sample size is needed for this study. Whether the significant difference is absent or present, it is of significance for clinicians to obtain a clear basic understanding of the relationship between coronavirus and coagulation function as well as the influence of inflammatory factors on this process to make clinical judgement, provide early preventive anti-coagulation therapy for COVID-19 patients and eventually reduce the risk of thromboembolism.\nNormal coagulation processes include platelet thrombosis, fibrin formation, and fibrinolysis. When the blood vessel wall is damaged and the subcutaneous tissue in the blood vessel comes into contact with the blood, the coagulation process starts. The platelet membrane protein and the collagen at the damaged vessel bind simultaneously to vascular hemophilia factor (VWF). By this bridging effect, platelets adhere to the damaged tissue. The platelets bound to the damaged tissues undergo morphological changes at the same time. This change is conducive to the aggregation of more platelets and more stable adhesion to the damaged vascular sites. These binding platelets activate prothrombin conversion to thrombin, which promotes activation of the clotting system, resulting in the formation of fibrin, which further stabilizes the formation of thromboembolus.\nThe patients with a coronavirus infection show hypercoagulability. This suggests that coronavirus infection can lead to hypercoagulability. Unfortunately, the specific mechanism is still unclear. However, coronaviruses may cause hypercoagulability through complex pathophysiological processes and have pro-coagulant effects throughout the coagulation process. Within the patients with SARS-CoV, the total VWF level and binding VWF level were increased, while the platelet level in blood circulation decreased, suggesting that coronavirus infection promoted the process of platelet thrombosis, thereby activating the subsequent coagulation cascade. In addition, as noted above, patients with a coronavirus infection have elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, which have been shown to promote the clotting process in a number of ways. Studies have confirmed that the inflammatory factors can directly promote the generation of the tissue factors and reduce the activity of tissue factor pathway inhibitor, which results in an increased level of tissue factor. In addition, inflammatory factors reduce the level of thromboregulatory protein, which directly inhibits the synthesis, activation, and function of protein C, while increasing the consumption of protein C, finally leading to the activation of the coagulation cascade. In addition, the inflammatory factors can increase the formation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and the inhibition of protein C also reduces the lysis of PAI-1, which collectively causes a rise of PAI-1 levels and the inhibition of fibrinolysis, thus promoting the coagulation process and even the formation of microthrombi. When the coagulation system is stimulated, it can be utilized in turn by specific viruses for their infection. It is conjectured that 2019-nCoV can also proliferate and spread by virtue of the disordered clotting function. Moreover, coronavirus can be wrapped by fibrin from the coagulation system for ease of escaping from immunological recognition, leading to the proliferation as well as a prolonged course of the disease.\nCurrent evidence shows that infection and cytokine storms triggered by 2019-nCoV can cause clotting disorders through various mechanisms, which may increase the risk of thromboembolism. This finding suggests that it is good practice to assess the risk of thrombosis in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with coronavirus infection. According to the Padua risk prediction score, those highrisk patients with scores ≥4, combined with a low risk of bleeding, should be given preventive anti-coagulant therapy and relevant examinations to prevent the occurrence of thromboembolism. Anti-coagulation treatment should be maintained throughout the whole therapeutic process. Novel opinions and suggestions are likewise needed regarding the relationship between COVID-19 and the coagulation system, especially those different from septic clotting disorders caused by other infections. Furthermore, glucocorticoids should be required to suppress inflammation so as to improve the hypercoagulation state. Severe COVID-19 patients need to go off glucocorticoid when cytokine storms are inhibited, because glucocorticoids can equally inhibit the normal immune system and promote the activation of the coagulation system.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> The pathophysiological mechanism of coronavirus-induced thromboembolism needs to be further studied to provide a biological basis and to amend the SOP of clinical anti-coagulation therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Some data suggest that drug-eluting stents (DES) represent a promising new option for the treatment of patients with ISR. Currently,2 DES platforms are available [sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) ], but the superiority of either approach for treating ISR has not been convincingly demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively compare angiographic and clinical outcomes after treatment of ISR with SES or PES in a series of consecutive patients with ISR.Methods A total of 745 consecutive patients were treated with bare metal stents from April 12, 2004 to December 31, 2004 in our center. Of these, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) was performed in 54 ISR from 54 patients at 7 months. Of the 54 patients with ISR, 36 received SES and 18 received PES.Follow-up included angiography and assessment of clinical outcome, both performed 7 months after DES implantation.Results There were no significant differences in baseline clinical data (including medication usage and lesion characteristics) between the two groups. Except for overlapping of multiple stents, procedural parameters were also similar in both groups. Seven-month angiographic follow-up showed that the binary restenosis rate was higher in patients treated with PES than that in patients treated with SES (in-stent binary restenosis: 27.8% vs 5.6%, P＜0.023; In-segment binary restenosis: 44.4% vs 13.9%, P＜0.014).

It is more prominent as the increase of China's aging population, accounting for 9.76% of the whole population in China. The number of hip fractures throughout the world is estimated approximately to 2.6 million by the year 2025, and 4.5 million by the year 2050.1 Because of high mortality and morbidity2 and high socioeconomic costs,3 hip fracture has been studied in many aspects ranging from its mechanism and treatment, as well as the concerns to minimize medical expense. There are two main types of hip fractures according to the involved anatomic site: femoral neck fracture and femoral intertrochanteric fracture. They may have different characteristics and outcome.4 Some factors may induce different types of hip fractures. Some authors have attempted to identify the different characteristics between femoral neck fracture and femoral intertrochanteric fracture, and suggested that old age is more common in patients with femoral intertrochanteric fracture and low bone mineral density is more strongly related to femoral neck fracture.5 Calcium has anti-fracture effect based on its key structural role in bone and metabolic balance.6,7 Serum calcium level shows some changes in different periods of fracture healing process8 and serum lactate is a prognostic indicator for patients with hip fracture.9 The fluctuation of serum calcium levels may represents the capability of calcium transportation, reservation, metabolism, and restoration.

Fasting blood samples were measured using automatic biochemical analyzer 删除2：<u>(Cobas 8000, Germany)</u> in three periods: the time of admission, postoperation and discharge. The time of admission and post-operation refers to the first day after admission or operation, while the time of discharge means the day of discharge. Neither special diet nor calcium was applied to patients after surgery. Low albumen is a sign of systemic inflammation as well as potentially chronic nutritional insufficiency. Therefore, serum calcium, creatinine, BUN, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin were evaluated in the three periods. Our research was approved for the ethic consents by the department concerned in our hospital.\nThe gender and injured side in two groups were compared by χ2 test. The age is expressed by mean ± standard deviation (±s), and compared by t-test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare serum calcium, creatinine, and BUN levels of three different periods.\nA total of 196 hip fractures were included in this study. The femoral neck fracture group consisted of 101 cases, in which 81 cases (80.20%) were female, and 20 (19.80%) were male. Right side lesions were found in 52 cases (51.49%), and left lesions in 49 cases (48.51%). The mean age was 73.85 years. The femoral intertrochanteric fracture group consisted of 95 cases.

The mean age was 76.27 years. In femoral neck fracture group, the mean time from injury to admission was (26.3 ± 22.4) hours, mean time from admission to surgery was (41.7 ± 22.5) hours, and mean length of surgery was (1.6 ± 0.7) hours.

Hip fracture is a complex fracture involved in many factors.10,11,12,13,14 A strategy to secure adequate and standardized perioperative treatment is important. Age, injury mechanism, local anatomic factor, insulin-like growth factor and static balance ability are factors potentially inducing different types of hip fractures. Calderazzi et al15 found that osteoarthritis strongly affects the location of the fracture in the proximal femur. In our other biomechanics study, we collected 16 patients' images (8 femoral intertrochanteric and 8 femoral neck fractures), and analyzed the lateral lesion by finite element analysis, and found that the type of hip fracture may be influenced by different densities of fractured region, namely, bony mineral density may predict the location of hip fracture. Larrosa et al4 compared 128 patients with femoral neck fractures and 196 patients with femoral intertrochanteric fractures. No difference was found in the age, sex, calcium level, nutritional, healthy, and functional status or presence of previous fractures between groups. Since these data obtained were only from admission to surgical intervention, it did not represent the whole dynamic changes of serum calcium levels in two different types of hip fractures, which may not indicate the capability of calcium transportation, reservation, metabolism, and restoration.\nCalcium balance refers to the state of the body stores up calcium at equilibrium over some extended period (usually days, weeks or months).16 This study is the first one to observe serum calcium levels in patients at three periods, i.e. admission, postoperation, and discharge. Since all these fractures were acute injury cases and the blood samples were drawn at the time of admission when the fracture healing process had not yet started, admission sample would roughly predict the basic level of serum calcium (calcium reservation). Postoperative sample would roughly show the accommodated level of serum calcium under the condition of stress reaction to trauma (calcium transportation and metabolism). Discharge sample would roughly reflect the resilience level of serum calcium in the recovery process (calcium restoration). Concerning the albumin level at admission between two groups, the difference was not statistically significant, indicating that the situation of the nutritional status of the patients in two groups is similar. The levels of serum calcium from admission to discharge were higher in femoral neck fracture group than femoral intertrochanteric fracture group. The magnitude of serum calcium fluctuation was larger in femoral neck group than femoral intertrochanteric group, indicating that the capability of reservation, restoration of serum calcium is better in patient with femoral neck fractures than those with femoral intertrochanteric fractures.\nCalcium plays a key role in a wide range of biologic functions, either in the form of its free ion or bound complex. One of the most important functions as bound calcium is skeletal mineralization, which accounts for more than 99% in proportion of total body calcium. Serum calcium represents ionized calcium, which represents less than 1% of total body calcium. Among them, 35% combine with albumin, the other 60% exist as activated ions, and the remaining 5% become citric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid complex. Serum calcium homeostasis has evolved to simultaneously maintain extracellular ionized calcium levels in the physiologic range, allowing the flow of calcium to and from essential stores. Biological calcium, especially ionized calcium, has important significance in the body's physiological function to maintain the body's normal life activities. With regard to the signal transduction factor that most commonly used in an organism, calcium plays an important role in the process of cellular division, growth and apoptosis, regulating the life process from fertilization, development, reproduction to nerve excitement and conduction.删除4：<u>17</u>\nPhysiological functions of serum calcium are generally divided into five aspects. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Calcium is an important factor in the process of coagulation: ionized calcium prompts prothrombin into thrombin that turns fibrinogen into fibrin in order to make blood clotting. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Calcium can maintain a normal permeability inside and outside of blood vessels to reduce the permeability of cell membrane of capillaries. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Calcium participates in the activation of many enzymes and enhancement of the activity in the body. Calcium in the cytoplasm regulates all sorts of physiological activities of cells as a messenger. When intracellular ionized calcium concentration increases, it activates a variety of protease and finishes all kinds of the body physiological activities by combination with CaM protein. 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> The contraction of cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle relies on by calcium transportation and metabolism. 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Because it can reduce the excitability of nerve muscle, ionized calcium is of important significance in the biology of neuromuscular excitement and transmission of nerve impulse.\nWe hypothesized that two potential mechanisms may correlate with the type of hip fracture. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Elderly individuals are typically in a negative bone balance, which leads to age-related bone loss. Though bone mineral density can not be totally measured by serum calcium level, ionized calcium can relatively reflect body calcium (calcium reservation) to some extent, and reveal bone mineral density based on its key structural role in the bone. Bone strength is not only related with bony mineral density, but also with bone ultrastructure, which has a close relationship with the mechanical properties.7 The level of serum calcium may affect bone ultrastructure. Thus, different types of hip fractures are induced by anatomic specificity of the bone, i.e. mineral density. We hypothesized that compared with femoral neck fracture, femoral intertrochanteric fracture belongs to extracapsular hip fractures. The capsular ligament of hip joint (iliofemoral ligament, pubofemoral ligament, and ischiofemoral ligament) may provide relative stability, preventing femoral neck from torsional displacement of three axes. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> A mechanism by which serum calcium might influence fracture type is via its binding to the calcium-sensing receptor because these receptors are expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells. Serum calcium fluctuation can reveal the ability of calcium transportation and restoration, which affects the number and sensitivity of calcium-sensing receptor in the lower limb muscle. Lower limb muscle strength, especially the iliopsoas and gluteus, play an important role in the process of maintaining posture balance. Lower limb muscle strength decline is the main factor for oscillation amplitude increase of standing posture in old people, damaging the elderly to correct body gravity swings. Therefore standing ability decline can lead to increased risk of falls. In addition, as the serum calcium decreases, neuro-transmitter release is affected, so did excitement and inhibition function of the nervous system. As a result, a performance of neurasthenia and low nervous adjustment appear in old-aged persons. In our series, serum calcium values maintained at a critical low level in the two groups after operation, suggesting that the transportation ability of serum calcium under stress is similar in two groups. We regard it as a self-protective reaction to avoid the danger of calcium deficiency.\nThe limitation in our study is its small number of samples. Whether the surgical intervention would influence serum calcium is not fully considered in this study. In addition, the mechanisms by which serum calcium fluctuation may induce two different hip fracture types need further research including experimental and randomized controlled trials.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2016.06.003</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

In 2010 data from NCCR reported that childhood cancer comprised approximately 0.6% of all cancers. In a recent study analyzed data from 145 cancer registries in China, the age-standardized incidence rate of childhood cancer was 87.1 per million. The top five commonest childhood cancers were leukemia (35.6 per million), central nervous system (CNS) tumor (15.0 per million), lymphoma (6.4 per million), bone cancer (4.4 per million) and kidney cancer (3.7 per million).2 The incidence is lower than western countries but similar to those reported by other low-middle income countries. The reasons for lower incidence of childhood cancer may be related to incomplete data collection. In China, there is a large floating population, 221 million, who were not permanent residents in locations they worked and might not be included in the city registration. The projected number of new cases of childhood cancer in 0-14 years is 22 875, and new cases of leukemia projected to be 8943 in 2015. It is important to have accurate data on incidence and survival that will help the government in policy making on health care delivery.删除4：<u>3</u>\nThe development of pediatric oncology as a subspecialty started in late 1970s. Dr. Yamei Hu from Beijing Children’s Hospital is the first pediatrician in China to conduct research in childhood leukemia in 1970s.4 Some hospitals established special teams under department of pediatrics and surgery to take care of children with leukemia and solid tumors. In 1997, the formation of Chinese Children Cancer Group (CCCG) under the China Anti-Cancer Association was a milestone in development of pediatric oncology service. The various specialties participated in the discussion of solving the practical clinical problems, from diagnostics to treatment. Pediatric hematology and other subspecialties including pediatric surgical oncology, radiotherapy, radiology and pathology could have discussion on collaboration under a common platform. The department of pediatric hematology in many hospitals gradually evolved into departments of pediatric hematology/oncology. Pediatric surgery had long history of taking care of solid tumors in children, from diagnosis to management including surgery and chemotherapy. Some hospitals developed the multi-disciplinary approach with better delineation of roles in management of childhood cancers. With the collaboration among various specialties in a hospital, a comprehensive cancer treatment plan was established in some hospitals. In the late 1990s, some regional collaboration started in some more developed cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Some standard treatment protocols were prepared and introduced to other hospitals in nearby region for adoption. China is a large country and the standard of management of childhood cancer varies quite a lot among different parts of the country. In the more developed regions, the standard is now approaching that of the developed countries.\nThe type of cancer treatment offered to children in China is quite variable, depending on geographical and economical situation. The children cancer units are located mainly in big cities, either in children hospitals or big general hospitals (usually university teaching hospitals). Traditionally the leukemia and lymphoma were managed by hematologists in department of pediatrics, whereas solid tumors (including surgery and chemotherapy) are managed by pediatric surgeons. There are some specialized hospitals taking care of brain tumors, bone tumors and retinoblastoma. Most of the patients are referred to the large centers for diagnosis and treatment. In the past, some big centers could not cope with the demand of large patient volume and patients had to wait for longer time to receive treatment. With the expansion of health care system, building new hospitals and setting up more children cancer units, patients can now have access to cancer care in nearby hospitals. However, some families still seek specialized care in big cities hoping for better outcome.\nAffordability to expensive medical cost in treatment of childhood cancers was the major barrier for optimal care. In the past, abandonment of treatment was one of the most important hurdle and the reported abandonment rate in early 2000s was up to 50%.5,6 The central government started the health care insurance program which also covered children with serious illnesses. China’s social health insurance schemes including the rural new cooperative medical scheme (NCMS; launched in 2003) and urban resident-based basic medical insurance scheme (URBMI; launched in 2007) had significantly improved the access to medical treatment.7 The abandonment rate has dropped to less than 10% in recent years.删除4：<u>5</u>\nWith the improvement of health insurance system and rapid increase in number of patients demanding for medical care, many centers are now operating at >100% bed occupancy rate and some patients are turned away because hospital beds are not available. There are many new hospitals built or expansion of existing hospitals to cope with the demand in recent years. Training of health care team to manage children cancer is required. New generation of diagnostic equipment are installed to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis, e.g. CT scan, MRI scan and PET scan. Radiotherapy facilities are also upgraded and proton therapy is also newly introduced. Immunophenotyping, molecular diagnosis and genetic tests for leukemia and childhood cancers are now easily available in many large hospitals. There are now some diagnostic technology companies providing new genetic testing at a short turn-around time. Some companies also offer whole genome sequencing for possibility of target therapy in some high risk malignancies.\nSome advanced centers in China introduced new treatment and achieved excellent treatment outcome. Shanghai Children’s Medical Center has a large stem cell transplant unit with over 150 transplant performed each year. Nanfang Hospital also performed transplant with novel regimen with excellent outcome.8 Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) treatment is recently reported to have good result in refractory leukemia in US. China is now also actively engaged in CART clinical trials and probably the country with largest number of patients recruited into the clinical trials. Beijing Children’s Hospital has developed CD19 and GD2 CART for more than 50 patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia and neuroblastoma. Shanghai Children’s Medical Center also developed the in-house CART therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Surgical treatment of childhood cancer is also at high standard with capacity to handle complex conditions.\nThere is great variance in treatment standard across the country and it is also impossible to centralize most of the cancer cases in the developed centers. From early 2000s, the improvement of the socio-economic condition hastened the formation of some collaborative groups. There are two national groups initiated collaborative clinical studies. The Chinese Children Leukemia Group (CCLG) started the CCLG-ALL 2008 Study. A total of 2231 patients were recruited from 10 hospitals across the country from 2008 to 2013.9 Recently CCLG organized another two clinical trials on childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), namely CCLG-AML 2015 study 通用删除7(英):<u>(2015-2018)</u> and CCLG-APL 2016 study 通用删除7(英):<u>(2016-2019)</u>, respectively. These studies included randomization questions on choices of induction or maintenance chemotherapeutic agents .\nMulticenter clinical trials in China\n删除重复语句：<u>Multicenter clinical trials in China</u>\nALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; APL, acute promyelocytic leukemia; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; NHL, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; BL/DLBCL, Burkitt lymphoma/diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; ALCL, anaplastic large cell lymphoma; LBL, lymphoblastic lymphoma; RCT, randomized controlled trial; ATRA, all-trans-retinoic acid; Ph, Philadelphia chromosome; BFM, Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster; ATO, arsenic trioxide; RIF, Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula; MRD, minimal residual disease; PET/CT, positron-emission tomography/computed tomography.\nCCCG under the China Anti-Cancer Association has prepared or under preparation of the following treatment protocols which form the treatment guidelines for all centers in China: neuroblastoma, germ cell tumor, hepatoblastoma, renal tumor, mature B lymphoma and CNS tumors.10 These guidelines however are not formal research protocols and only serve as treatment recommendation. CCCG has organized one of the largest clinical trials in China, the CCCG-ALL-2015 Study. The Study is led by the National Center for Children’s Health (Shanghai) and supported by St Jude Children’s Research Hospital and the VIVA Foundation. Up to January 2019, and 6024 patients were recruited into the study. A randomized study comparing two different tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib versus dasatinib) was also completed.11 Other than prospective studies, the Group also conducted retrospective studies on some rare conditions.删除4：<u>12</u>\nOther than the two national groups, some hospitals also initiated regional multicenter studies. Shanghai Children’s Medical Center started a SCMC 2005 Study with 5 centers participating.13 In south China, there was a longer history of multicenter studies. In 2002, the Guangzhou Childhood Leukemia Group (GZCLG) started the first pediatric ALL study. Seven hospitals in Guangzhou city joined the study with 446 patients recruited.14 The GZCLG later expanded to form the Guangdong Province Childhood Leukemia/lymphoma Group (GDCLG) with more hospitals from different cities in the Province joining, the diseases studied also extended to include APL. The GD-2008 ALL study with 9 hospitals participated with over 1700 patients recruited.15 The Group further expanded to South China Children Cancer Group (SCCCG) in 2016 with 22 hospitals joining. The multicenter clinical trials in SCCCG also include Wilms tumor and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). SCCCG-Wilms tumor-2011 and SCCCG-NHL-2017 are ongoing. Some of the completed and ongoing clinical trials are listed in Table 1.\nThe future development of pediatric oncology research in China requires a more structured organization to oversee the registry, data management, development of clinical trial protocols and proper conduct of multi-center trials. At the moment, the two national organizations do not have a permanent structure to oversee the research activities. There are some ad hoc studies ongoing which are investigator initiated and resources are always limited. Data collection and data quality is one of the most challenging tasks in multicenter studies. The individual institutions do not have dedicated manpower as data managers. Not uncommonly some junior doctors or post-graduate students or nurses are assigned for data management. However, there may not be training for these data specialist and they are also not full time staff for such research purposes. In the past experience, chasing of missing data is very time consuming and sometimes unrewarding. In recent years, some institutions can obtain research funding from university or government research grant, this may help to employ some dedicated staff in data management which will improve the data quality. In the most recent multicenter study with large number of patients recruited, the CCCG 2015 Study already has over 6000 subjects, the data management is particularly important. Fortunately the study could obtain grant support from the non-government organization, VIVA Foundation. The funding support is essential to maintain a central data office, support to individual hospitals to employ staff to handle data, and more important is the conduct of site audits.\nWhether the several China groups should merge into one huge national group is not certain. The logistics would be more complicated in view of the huge population and also variations in the study group settings. The experience from North America and Japan may be good reference, it took several decades of building trust among several collaborative groups to merge into one large national group.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

One case was reported on the successful treatment of severe GBS (AMAN) on postoperation of renal carcinoma and meningioma, aiming to provide successful treatment experience in such severe cases.\nA 65-year-old female was initially diagnosed with cerebellar meningioma in admission on December 8, 2016, at the same time, she was diagnosed left renal cancer first taken radical resection of renal carcinoma and pathology showed clear-cell carcinoma, Class II. Magnetic resonance imaging on brain suggested an occupied lesion on the left cerebellar hemisphere with the size of 1.9 cm × 1.9 cm × 2.6 cm and considered a meningioma, then, the patient was performed left cerebellar meningioma resection, and pathology showed the fibrous meningioma (WHO Class I). On the 8th day after surgery, the patient was considered upper respiratory tract infection, and 2 days later, she suffered a rapid double upper limbs weakness, but normal feeling with negative head computed tomography examination. Hoarseness together with gradual weak muscle strength proximal limbs (Grade II) was considered a possibility of GBS and further the subtype of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (AIDP). On the 11th day, she was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for machine ventilation when respiratory muscle paralysis and sitting-like breathing.\nThe ventilator paralysis were aggravated on the 12th day, and intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) with the dose of 0.4 g∙kg−1∙d−1 was recommended for 5 days, then the limbs strength slightly improved 3 days later. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggested protein-cell separation and positive shows of Pandy test. Then, linezolid was used for the prevention of anti-infection as the patient was of unexplained fever with a climate of 39.9°C on the 18th to 22nd day and sputum culture showed Stenotrophomonasmaltophilia. She was then suffered from bloating and incomplete intestinal obstruction on 23rd day and unexplained declined blood pressure added increased heart rate to depend on norepinephrine. The serum sampled suggested existence of the IgM and IgG antibody about ganglioside antibody GM1 and nothing on Ri, Yo, and Hu from serum and CSF. Consequently, AMAN, a rare subtype of GBS, was more likely to be considered and plasma (PE) or the second use of IVIG was recommended, but family members refused to exchange by plasma. Therefore, reuse of IVIG on the 28th day for 5 days performed, but the effect was not significant.\nOn the 7th and 8th week postoperatively, antibiotics replacement was made since blood culture showed Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae, respectively. The prone position drainage 2 to 4 times 1 day was first used from 9th week on for serious atelectasis which was unsatisfied by daily bronchoscopy suction and chest radiograph showed improvement on left lung brightness, atelectasis, and pleural effusion on the 8th week. Then, the frequency of posture drainage was every other day 5 days later because of better lung recruitment. She obtained the gradual improved respiratory function and even accepted appropriate off-machine exercise after 3 months, which made it feasible to undergo electromyography (EMG) examination showed motor fiber was completely involved. The suspending on machine ventilation made it possible for the next rehabilitation training 4 months later and was eventually discharged for further with grade 4 of limb strength. Then, the patient can get up self-depended and support stand in and walk for 5–10 m and is not many restrictions on using spoon to the past follow-up 7 months later.\nGBS is a kind of acute immune-mediated inflammatory peripheral neuropathy. It includes AIDP, AMAN, acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), Miller Fisher syndrome, acute panautonomic neuropathy and acute sensory neuropathy, and other subtypes. As the classical GBS, the pathology of AIDP is monocyte-macrophage infiltration and directly attacks myelin protein with intact construction. The titer of ganglioside antibodies (GM1, GM1b, GD1a, and GaNac- GD1a) in the serum of AMAN patients is significantly increased.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The prodromal symptoms of GBS are diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infections.

The diagnostic criteria of AMAN and AMSAN refer to AIDP, of which the feature of AMAN suggests a pure motor nerve dysfunction and significant damage on the motor axon. This patient suffered upper respiratory tract infection with rapid progress after 1 week postoperatively, symmetrical limbs muscle weakness, respiratory muscle paralysis, autonomic nervous dysfunction, and CSF are considered the simple motor axonal nerve damage and consequently, a diagnosis of AMAN is approximately confirmed.\nPithadia and Kakadia通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> pointed out infection and surgery may induce GBS and Campylobacter jejuni is the main pathogen which can increase monosialotetrahexosyl-ganglioside antibody to induce ganglioside-associated GBS, as well as some reports on the induction of GBS when using monosialoglycolic ganglioside sodium injection postoperatively. It is the surgery stress that may be considered as an important incentive of GBS she was performed two tumor-related surgeries in the short term. The positive result of GM1 antibody prompted the GBS ganglioside-related AMAN, positive IgM and IgG was considered the application of ganglioside and blood-brain barrier may be damaged after meningioma surgery which eased the drug enter the CSF circulation and induced lesions. Therefore, the etiology on this GBS is of high confident of administrating ganglioside drugs.\nThere are reports on respiratory muscle paralysis as the main symptom of GBS, Erasmus GBS scores (EGOS) model mentioned by Walgaard et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> in 2010 can predict respiratory insufficiency of GBS patients within 1 week and a revised, modified EGOS (mEGOS) model in 2011 can effectively predict patient’s condition with a period of 6 months after diagnosis. One case that intestinal obstruction is as the first manifestations of GBS indicates that paralytic ileus in patients with GBS may be associated with a sympathetic and parasympathetic bowel dysfunction and mononuclear cell infiltration and extensive demyelination surrounding sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system has been demonstrated pathologically.\nAutonomic nerve dysfunction such as blood pressure fluctuations and arrhythmia can be caused in GBS which about 3–10% of GBS patients would die of. That it is usually of no omen on severe autonomic nerve dysfunction must be successively monitored, the same as the management of the respiratory tract and nutrition support. This patient was treated timely with position drainage of high efficacy and respiratory management on anti-infection.\nEarly use of IVIG or PE but not combination was repeatedly recommended by the Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chinese GBS and foreign scholars, but recently some new ideas, to some extent, of significance on GBS treatment emerged.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> A clinical study of the dose-response effects of secondary administration of IVIG is currently being conducted internationally in patients with poor prognosis of GBS which are evaluated according to the mEGOS model, which pointed out that conventionally a second dose of IVIG may be 2 g/kg for 2–5 days according to the clinical experience as the patients’ symptom seems improved.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Some new drugs such as eculizumab and individualized treatment of IVIG are being used, especially for those of poor prognosis.

However, chimera studies conducted by the same group failed to prove that circulating fibrocytes were of hematopoietic origin, which may be associated with the inability of irradiation with 800 rads (1 rad = 0.01 Gy) to kill all the HSCs.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Later, in vivo and in vitro experiments with different methods to trace circulating fibrocytes confirmed that these cells originate from HSCs.通用删除6(英):<u>[37,38,39]</u>\nIn vitro experiments suggested that fibrocytes differentiated from monocytes.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> In this monocyte to fibrocyte differentiation, monocytes first differentiate into M1 macrophages, the latter become M2 macrophages, and finally M2 macrophages give rise to fibrocytes. This transition can be modulated by many factors. T-cells are indispensable in monocyte to fibrocyte differentiation, and deficiency in T-cells impairs this process as can be seen in a study that nude rats undergoing myocardial infarction (MI) showed few circulating fibrocytes within the myocardium.通用删除6(英):<u>[40,41]</u> Many cytokines are involved in this differentiation. For example, Th1 cytokines (interferon-γ and interleukin-12 [IL-12]) suppress this process while Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) promote this differentiation.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> In addition, epigenic modulation can also be a way to regulate this differentiation.\nInhibition of Class I histone deacetylases was shown to suppress differentiation of monocytes to circulating fibrocytes.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>\nOf note, circulating fibrocytes represent a part of stromal cells in embryos,通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> therefore although circulating fibrocytes are recruited to certain sites in disease state, their presence in normal tissues was also reported.通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45]</u>\nMorphologically, circulating fibrocytes are 50–200 μm long spindle-shaped cells with ellipsoid nuclei, and there are prominent projections on the surface of them.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> They express markers of both hematopoietic cells (CD34, CD45, and leukocyte-specific protein 1) and mesenchymal cells (collagen I, procollagen-I).通用删除6(英):<u>[40,46]</u> Therefore, a combination of hematopoietic and mesenchymal markers is widely used in identifying circulating fibrocytes 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>. To confirm the hematopoietic origin of circulating fibrocytes, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic mice are frequently used in the tracing of circulating fibrocytes 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>. Bone marrow cells of these GFP-transgenic mice are injected into experimental mice. Then, double staining of mesenchymal markers with GFP indicates the existence of circulating fibrocytes.\nIn general, circulating fibrocytes are polyfunctional. They can produce ECM通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> and a variety of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, platelet-derived growth factor-A, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and matrix metalloproteinases.通用删除6(英):<u>[45,47]</u> Circulating fibrocytes are regarded as precursors of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. Once differentiated into fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, the production of ECM can even be enhanced.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> During this process, circulating fibrocytes will lose their expression of CD34 and CD45, and express α-SMA, a marker of myofibroblasts.通用删除6(英):<u>[49,50]</u> This differentiation can be spontaneous when isolated fibrocytes are cultured in vitro通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> and will be enhanced when cytokines such as endothelin-1, TGF-β1, and connective tissue growth factor are added to the culture medium.通用删除6(英):<u>[33,48,52]</u> In addition to tissue remodeling, circulating fibrocytes also participate in a variety of processes, including antigen presentation and angiogenesis,通用删除6(英):<u>[53,54]</u> which will not be extensively discussed here.\nIt is estimated that circulating fibrocytes comprise 0.1–1% of nonerythrocytes in peripheral blood,通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u> and this proportion is relatively stable unless injuries such as inflammation and hypoxia occur. For example, in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD), the proportion of circulating fibrocytes goes up to 6–10%,通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> and during exacerbation of ILD, up to 15% of nonerythrocytes in the blood are circulating fibrocytes.通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u> The alteration of the amount of circulating fibrocytes is probably mediated by chemokine ligand/chemokine receptor axis. Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that control the migratory patterns and positioning of cells expressing chemokine receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed on the surfaces of circulating fibrocytes.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> The binding of chemokines to chemokine receptors directs the mobilization of circulating fibrocytes according to the gradient of chemokines.通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u> In response to injuries such as inflammation and hypoxia, the concentrations of chemokines in both peripheral blood and organs are elevated, and this elevation leads to accumulation of circulating fibrocytes in blood stream and injured organs.通用删除6(英):<u>[59,60]</u> This has been shown in many studies. For example, CXC-chemokine ligand 16 (CXCL16) (a transmembrane CXC chemokine) knockout mice administrated with angiotensin II (Ang II) were found to have significantly less circulating fibrocytes in injured kidney compared with these in wild-type mice,通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> indicating CXCL16 is one of the mediators involved in circulating fibrocyte recruitment.\nAccumulating evidence has indicated that circulating fibrocytes are involved cardiac fibrosis, when hosts are subject to hypertension, aging, cardiac ischemia, AF, and heart failure.\nHypertension, defined as a usual blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), is now a leading cause of death and is recognized as a risking factor for MI, aortic dissection, and cardiac fibrosis. In hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis, circulating fibrocytes may play a role. It has been shown that patients with hypertensive heart disease had more circulating fibrocytes in peripheral blood, which is also correlated with left ventricular mass.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> In experimental models, it was found that Ang II infusion or transverse aortic constriction which resulted in a significant increase of blood pressure, causes a significant increase of fibrocytes in the hearts, resulting in enhanced deposition of collagen in the affected hearts.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25,31,62]</u> Interestingly, it was shown in a study that NaCl, an excessive intake of which will lead to hypertension, can potentiate monocyte to fibrocyte differentiation, enhancing ECM production.通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u>\nHeart failure is one of the most common and costly disabling diseases worldwide. It is a heterogeneous syndrome caused by the inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood to meet the requirement of metabolizing tissues. Cardiac fibrosis is commonly seen in patients with heart failure,通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> and circulating fibrocytes may be involved in this process. Using Mst1 mice, which are animal models of chronic heart failure without acute ischemia (a common cause of fibrocyte recruitment), it was found that cardiomyocytes in chronic heart failure can secrete chemotactic factor, stromal-derived factor-1, recruiting circulating fibrocytes to the myocardium, and contributing to the fibrosis of affected hearts.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>\nCHD, causing 50% of death in developed countries, appears to rank number one in prevalence at present.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> Typically, CHD is characterized by atherosclerotic plaques presented in coronary arterial walls. These plaques narrow the lumen of coronary arteries, limiting blood supply to the hearts. Partial or complete coronary artery narrowing leads to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which is characterized by sudden loss of cardiomyocytes and overwhelming inflammatory response. Thereafter, the infarcted areas are replaced by collagen-rich scars because of the limited regeneration ability of cardiomyocytes.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> The scar was thought to be the production of resident myofibroblasts.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u> This paradigm is now challenged by many reports. It was shown in a study that a significant circulating fibrocytes were present within the myocardium on day 7 post-MI. Examination of the heart tissue revealed that 24% of myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow, indicating that circulating fibrocytes contributed to reparative process of the hearts after MI.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Similar results were obtained from other studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,20,32,68,69]</u> In addition to acute cardiomyocyte loss, daily, brief coronary occlusion, which does not cause death of cardiomyocytes, leads to increase of circulating fibrocytes in myocardium. It was shown that ischemia/reperfusion cardiomyopathy cause induction of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1, also known as chemokine [C-C motif] ligand-2) in cardiomyocytes, thus contributing to the recruitment of monocytes and circulating fibrocytes and cardiac fibrosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,70]</u> Although animal models of cardiac ischemia have shown that coronary occlusion leads to infiltration of circulating fibrocytes into myocardium, it is reported that patients with AMI had less circulating fibrocytes in peripheral blood.通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u> As it was shown that circulating fibrocytes were present in fibrous caps,通用删除6(英):<u>[72]</u> the decrease of circulating fibrocytes may contribute to instability of atherosclerotic plaques. This result indicated that elevated circulating fibrocytes may not always be unfavorable.\nAF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and its morbidity and mortality are now increasing.通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u> Atrial fibrosis is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of AF.通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u> It was reported that the number of circulating fibrocytes in peripheral blood was also increased in patients with AF compared to patients with sinus rhythm.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Examination of left atrial tissue from the two groups also revealed that cardiac fibrosis was enhanced in tissue from patients with AF, coinciding with 3-fold more fibrocytes presenting in the atrial tissue.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> In addition, it was shown in the same study that circulating fibrocytes from patients with AF had enhanced ability to produce collagen when cultured in complete medium,通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> further unveiling important role of circulating fibrocytes in the development of atrial fibrosis.\nAge is a risk factor for many cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia. Aging hearts are characterized by loss of cardiomyocytes and progressive fibrosis. Many mechanisms are involved in age-related cardiac fibrosis, including TGF-β unresponsiveness and fibrocyte infiltration.通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u> It was found that compared with younger individuals, aging mice had more circulating fibrocytes in the hearts.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,28]</u> This increase of fibrocytes is correlated with up-regulation of MCP-1, Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13), thereby enhancing infiltration of monocytes and monocyte to fibrocyte differentiation.\nCirculating fibrocytes, a unique cell population, are of hematopoietic origin and circulate in peripheral blood. They are reminiscent of leukocytes and fibroblasts because of their co-expression of hematopoietic and mesenchymal markers. Accumulating evidence suggests that circulating fibrocytes are involved in the process of cardiac fibrosis, and it is shown that there are many ways to regulate biological behavior of circulating fibrocytes, such as modulating the recruitment and differentiation of circulating fibrocytes. Findings in the present study indicate that circulating fibrocytes can serve as a potential target for diminishing adverse effect of cardiac fibrosis, thereby improving prognosis of these patients. However, many aspects of circulating fibrocytes remain elusive, for instance, signaling pathway of cytokines in circulating fibrocytes is still unknown. Therefore, more studies are still needed to expand our understanding of circulating fibrocytes.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by the grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81000101)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The aim of the present study was to identify the prevalence and causes of ID in patients newly diagnosed with NB.\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Children’s Hospital and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.

The Ethical approval section was added.]\nAll patients included in this study were newly diagnosed with NB at the Hematology Oncology Center of Beijing Children’s Hospital between November 2015 and January 2018. The inclusion criteria were the availability of iron status measurements including iron, serum ferritin (SF), unsaturated iron-binding capacity, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) all acquired at the time of initial NB diagnosis, and being aged > 6 months. Clinical data including gender, age, primary tumor site, risk stratification, bone marrow metastasis, and hemoglobin (Hb) were all collected at the time of initial NB diagnosis.\nThe original tumor and any metastatic tumor were evaluated via computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, technetium-99 m bone scanning, 18F-labeled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron-emission computed tomography, bone marrow aspirates of the sternum and ilium, and biopsy specimens of the ilium. The patients were staged according to the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS).13 In accordance with the relevant guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of ID and ID anemia in China,14 anemia was defined as Hb < 110 g/L in children aged 6 months to 6 years, and Hb < 120 g/L in children aged between 6 years and 14 years. Anemia was classified as mild (Hb ≥ 90 g/L but < 110 g/L), moderate (Hb ≥ 60 g/L but < 90 g/L), or severe anemia (Hb < 60 g/L). ID was defined as TSAT < 20% and classified as AID or FID.6 AID was defined as TSAT < 20% and SF < 100 ng/mL, and FID was defined as TSAT < 20% and SF ≥ 100 ng/mL.\nThe primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) based solely on recurrence or otherwise of the index cancer. Recurrence was confirmed via biopsy, bone marrow aspirates of the sternum, imaging, or a combination thereof. Follow-up was conducted for the entire study population to 31 December 2018. By the end of the follow-up period, 14 patients were lost to follow-up, resulting in a complete follow-up rate of 92.8%.\nDescriptive data are presented as absolute frequencies, and qualitative data are presented as percentages.

Baseline characteristics of the patients including sex, age, primary tumor site, stage, risk stratification, anemia, bone marrow metastasis, and ID are shown in Table 1. The median age at the time of initial NB diagnosis was 35.0 months (range 6-148 months). The risk stratification rates were 10.3% for low risk, 28.2% for intermediate risk, and 61.5% for high risk. Anemia was observed in 128 of the 195 patients (65.6%), and 94 (48.2%) had bone marrow metastasis at the time of initial NB diagnosis.

Pre-existing ID anemia was reportedly independently associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with colon cancer.20 Multiple myeloma patients with abnormal iron metabolism including iron overload and ID exhibited poorer overall survival than those with normal iron metabolism.21 Increased DNA damage, genomic instability, and immunological dysfunction caused by ID may be responsible for the poorer prognoses reported during cancer development.22 Ferritin has been revealed as a prognostic factor for NB in many clinical studies,23,24,25 but little is known about how ferritin affects the survival of NB patients. FID was defined as TSAT < 20% and SF ≥ 100 ng/mL in the present study. These patients had high levels of ferritin but low levels of TSAT, while another group in the study had high levels of both ferritin and TSAT did not exhibit ID. FID has been shown to be associated with advanced disease and poor ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status in patients with solid tumors.18 In the NB patients in the present study, FID reflected insufficient availability of iron despite adequate iron reserves. Hepcidin, the main regulator of iron uptake and release, plays an important role in iron homeostasis and FID in cancer patients.6,7 Many studies have confirmed that hepcidin promotes the growth and progression of some types of solid tumors such as breast cancers, prostate cancers, and renal cell carcinomas via tumor iron retention and tumor cell survival.26,27,28 Notably however, the main mechanisms involved in the causation of FID by hepcidin and how abnormal iron metabolism affects the prognosis of patients with NB require further study.\nIn conclusion, in the present study there was a high prevalence of ID, mainly as FID, in patients newly diagnosed with NB. FID is an important feature and independent predictor of EFS in patients with NB. The long-term effects of iron supplementation in different types of ID in NB patients need to be investigated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The timing of maximal L3 lung entry was determined by counting the number of lung larvae at several time points after infection with 500 or 1000 L3. Mice were immunized either orally or subcutaneously with 500 L3, followed by two boosts of L3 once every two weeks. The immunized mice were challenged orally with 500 L3 one week after the final boost. To evaluate the protective immunity, the number of L3 recovered from the lungs of the immunized mice during the time of maximal larval entry was compared with that of controls. Host immunity was also evaluated by comparing circulating anti-L3 antibodies between immunized and controlled mice, using both enzyme immunoassays and immunoblotting techniques, and by lung histopathology.RESULTSThe peak time of larval entry into the lungs occurred 48 hours after infection. Mice immunized either orally or subcutaneously with L3 exhibited a marked reduction (90.2% and 86.2% respectively) in the number of recovered lung larvae in comparison to controls (P &lt; 0.01).

Pulmonary physicians now have more choices for management of benign tracheal stenosis because of recent advances in interventional pulmonology, including neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) laser resection, argon plasma coagulation, electrocautery, stent implantation, cryotherapy, and bronchoscopic balloon dilatation (BBD).通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> BBD has been accepted as a safe and efficient strategy and is recommended as a first-line treatment in the management of benign tracheobronchial obstruction.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u> However, dilatation of tracheal stenosis with BBD requires complete blocking of the airflow for as long as possible, and weak patients must endure hypoxia for relatively long periods of time. Additionally, most patients cannot hold their breath for a long period affecting the efficacy of BBD.\nWe performed endotracheal tube dilatation for dilatation of benign tracheal stenosis in 12 patients under local anesthesia and bronchoscopic guidance from March 2010 to August 2011. This technique ensured sustainable ventilation for patients during dilatation procedures. Although we achieved the desired results, the procedure was associated with complications resulting in rhinal or buccal mucosal lesions as well as a very unsatisfactory subjective experience for the patients. Therefore, in the present study, we used an extra-small-diameter tube as a respiratory duct for tracheal dilatation with BBD under local anesthesia and assessed the efficacy and safety of this technique.\nWe reviewed the clinical information of 26 patients with benign tracheal obstruction who underwent BBD using an extra-small-diameter tube at Department of Respiratory Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from June 2011 to November 2014. The patients included 16 men and 10 women with a mean age of 37.0 ± 17.3 years (range, 16–84 years). The tracheal obstructions were caused by endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy in 24 patients (92.3%) and by tracheal tuberculosis in 2 patients (7.7%). The stenosis sites included the upper trachea in 18 patients, the upper and middle trachea in 3, the middle trachea in 4, and the entire trachea plus the right main bronchus in 1.

The guide wire used in the procedures had a diameter of 0.85 mm and length of 180 mm (Qiuhong Medical Equipment Co. Changzhou, China), and the balloon catheter had a diameter of 14–16 mm and a length of 110 mm (Qiuhong Medical Equipment Co.). The inflation device was manufactured by Shenzhen Ant Hi-Tech Industrial Co. Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). The respiratory tube used for assisted ventilation was made of polycarbonate material or cut from a tracheal stent delivery system (Micro-Tech [Nanjing] Co. Ltd. Nanjing, China) and had a length of 30 cm and lumen diameter of 2.5–3.5 mm. A trial test in which a disposable syringe was used to simulate the trachea showed no obvious deformation of the tube at a pressure of 700 kPa.\nPreoperative preparation involved determination of each patient’s coagulation function, platelet count, blood gas analysis results, electrocardiographic findings, blood pressure, and dyspnea index using the American Thoracic Society dyspnea rating criteria.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> High-resolution computed tomography of the neck and chest, tracheobronchial three-dimensional reconstruction, and diagnostic bronchoscopy were performed to determine the extent of the tracheobronchial obstruction and for selection of the optimal tube and balloon size. All patients provided informed consent and underwent topical anesthesia (2% lidocaine) with an aerosol spray before the procedures. All procedures were performed under the following conditions: Oxygen flow of 3–5 L/min, electrocardiographic monitoring, and pulse oxyhemoglobin saturation monitoring. When clinically possible, blood gas analysis was performed 1 h before the procedure, during the procedure, and 2 h after the procedure.\nDiagnostic bronchoscopy was repeated to localize the airway obstruction and assess the proximal and distal extent of the obstruction. A guide wire was then inserted through the working channel of the flexible bronchoscope and passed through the tracheal stenosis. For distal obstructions of 3–4 mm, the guide wire was held in place over the obstruction while the bronchoscope was withdrawn and reinserted next to the guide wire so that the obstruction could be adequately visualized. For distal obstructions of 2–3 mm, a tube was passed over and along the guide wire and held in place over the obstruction. Importantly, insertion of the extra tube into the main bronchus was avoided to prevent unilateral pulmonary ventilation. The guide wire was then withdrawn, reinserted through the working channel of the flexible bronchoscope, and passed through the trachea. An appropriately sized balloon catheter was then advanced over the guide wire and positioned within the obstruction. Once the correct position was confirmed, the balloon was inflated using a balloon inflation device with 100–500 kPa of pressure and held at that pressure for 30–180 s. If the oxyhemoglobin saturation was ≤90% or the patient could not endure hypoxia, the BBD procedure was immediately stopped, and the balloon was deflated and removed. The initial results were immediately observed after the procedure, and the postoperative airway diameter of the obstruction was evaluated. Inflation was usually performed three to five times to obtain the desired results. Electrocautery or argon plasma coagulation was required in certain patients prior to BBD. Aerosol inhalation of budesonide (Budesonide Inhalation Suspension; AstraZeneca, London, UK) was recommended to prevent restenosis after each procedure.\nThe tracheal diameter, dyspnea index, and blood gas analysis results (PaO2 and PaCO2) are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-square test, and paired-samples of continuous variables were analyzed using the paired-sample t-test. Comparison of multiple means was performed by univariate analysis using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). All reported P values are two-sided, and statistical significance was defined as P ≤ 0.05. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).\nTwenty-six patients aged 16–84 years were included in our study. All 26 patients were diagnosed with tracheobronchial obstruction. Twenty-four patients (92.3%) had iatrogenic tracheal stenosis due to prolonged tracheal intubation or tracheotomy, and the remaining 2 (7.7%) had tracheobronchial tuberculosis. Symptomatic manifestations such as dyspnea, stridor, or coughing were present in all patients and were the main reasons for hospitalization. The locations of the tracheobronchial obstructions were as follows: Upper trachea in 18 patients, mid-trachea in 3, upper and mid-trachea in 4, and entire trachea in 1.\nThe immediate post-BBD changes in the tracheal diameter, dyspnea index, and blood gas analysis results are shown in Table 1. Among all procedures, the tracheal diameter significantly increased from 5.5 ± 1.5 mm to 13.0 ± 1.3 mm (P < 0.001), and the dyspnea index significantly decreased from 3.4 ± 0.8 to 0.5 ± 0.6 (P < 0.001). More importantly, the blood gas analysis results showed no dramatic change in PaO2 (before, 102.5 ± 27.5 mmHg; during, 96.9 ± 30.4 mmHg; and after, 97.2 ± 21.5 mmHg; P = 0.364). A side effect during the procedure was slight temporary retention of carbon dioxide (before, 43.5 ± 4.2 mmHg; during, 49.4 ± 6.8 mmHg; and after, 40.1 ± 3.9 mmHg; P < 0.001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.

PaO2: Partial pressure of oxygen; PaCO2: Partial pressure of carbon dioxide.\nThe complications related to the procedures are as follows. In 44 procedures, the patients experienced mild chest pain after treatment but recovered 1–2 days later without interventional therapy. In 46 procedures, the patients developed mild tracheal bleeding, which was treated with intratracheal instillation of epinephrine at a concentration of 1:10,000. Superficial tracheal laceration of the anterior or posterior tracheal wall occurred in 23 patients, resulting in mild pneumomediastinum. All 23 patients were symptomatic and recovered 1 week later without specific treatment. Respiratory tract infection occurred in 17 patients after the procedures and required antibiotic treatment. Convulsions occurred in two patients during the procedure and lasted 5–10 s, but all recovered upon immediate cessation of the procedure. Two patients developed arrhythmia, which was resolved immediately after the procedure. Only the tracheal laceration was directly related to the BBD.\nWith the development of intensive care medicine and an increasing number of patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit in China, endotracheal intubation and tracheotomy have become widely performed in the medical emergency settings. Thus, the complications associated with endotracheal intubation and tracheotomy such as benign tracheal stenosis, have been markedly increasing year to year. In many previous reports on benign tracheal stenosis, endotracheal intubation and tracheotomy are the most common causes of benign tracheal stenosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,6]</u> The estimated incidence of severe postintubation and posttracheotomy tracheal stenosis in the general population is 4.9 cases per million per year.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> In the present study, 24 (92.3%) tracheal stenoses developed after intubation or tracheotomy, and the remaining 2 (7.7%) were caused by tracheobronchial tuberculosis.\nBalloon dilatation for the treatment of tracheobronchial stenosis was first used and reported by Cohen et al. in 1984.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> BBD is an effective, safe, and easily performed interventional strategy for managing benign bronchial stenosis. BBD can also be combined with several other techniques to treat benign bronchial stenosis,通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> such as Nd: YAG laser treatment, cryotherapy, electrocautery, and stent placement. However, when performing BBD for tracheal stenosis dilatation, the trachea must be completely blocked, and weak patients are required to endure hypoxemia and carbon dioxide retention. This is an unavoidable clinical problem, especially in patients with severe tracheal stenosis; therefore, there are few reports on tracheal stenosis dilatation by BBD. In a previous study and in our clinical practice, most patients with tracheal stenosis endured hypoxemia for no more than 30–60 s, which is much shorter than the time required to reach the desired result. Questions remain on how to simultaneously solve this problem and ensure the safety and effectiveness of the procedure.\nIn our clinical practice, we found that patients with tracheal stenosis resulting in a lumen diameter of 3–6 mm can maintain an oxygen saturation of >90% at an oxygen inhalation rate of 3 L/min while resting. Based on this clinical observation, we introduced a small-diameter tube into the balloon dilatation procedure as a channel for assisted ventilation. Sixty-three procedures involving 306 effective balloon inflations were performed in 26 patients. Effective balloon inflation was defined as inflation of the balloon to the desired pressure for ≥30 s. Remarkable improvements in the tracheal diameter, dyspnea index, and ventilation were achieved immediately after the procedures. The initial cure rate was 100%. Some advantages of our new dilatation strategy are obvious. First, in our dilatation procedures, the extra tube acts as a temporary ventilation channel and effectively ensures the patient’s oxygen supply because complete blockage of the airway is not necessary. Thus, the patients need not endure long periods of hypoxia, and the prolonged inflation time is safer and increases the chance of obtaining the desired result. Continuous airflow was observed in the tubes during our procedures. The blood gas analysis results showed no dramatic change in PaO2 (P = 0.364). Most patients had no clinical manifestations of hypoxia and maintained an oxyhemoglobin saturation of >90%. These results are completely different from those of a previous report in which the PaO2 decreased by 8–20 mmHg during interventional procedures.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Thus, we were able to extend the duration of each inflation for a relatively long time (range, 30–180 s; mean, 87.9 ± 40.8 s) while using a lower balloon pressure of 100–500 kPa. This is another advantage of our procedure in contrast to published reports by Lee et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> and Low et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> in which BBD procedures were performed with a shorter inflation time (10–20 s) and higher balloon pressure (500–800 kPa). We have obtained similar ventilation effects via rigid bronchoscopy and a laryngeal mask airway.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14,15]</u> This technique may represent a novel approach to the management of benign tracheal stenosis under local anesthesia.\nTwo studies performed by Kim et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u> reported that tracheobronchial laceration was a common complication of balloon dilatation, occurring in 51.6% of cases (64/124; 60 were superficial and 4 were deep). During follow-up, the median cumulative airway patency period in patients with and without tracheobronchial laceration was 24 and 4 months, respectively. Thus, it seems that luminal rupture promoted long-term curative effects. However, deep laceration increases the risk of life-threatening pneumomediastinum and bleeding. In our study, 23 procedures were associated with superficial tracheal laceration, but no deep laceration occurred. The absence of the deep laceration in our procedures may be explained by the low balloon pressure we adopted.\nAlthough our procedure has shown initial success, there are two major limitations to our technique. Using our new inflation strategy, we observed that carbon dioxide retention occurred to some extent during most procedures. On the other hand, despite the 100% initial cure rate, we cannot completely eliminate the problem of restenosis. The major cause of restenosis is granulation tissue formation and subsequent fibrosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Compared with aerosol inhalation of budesonide in our study, some studies have reported the utility of mitomycin-C, high-dose-rate endobronchial brachytherapy, and glucocorticoid injection to prevent restenosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19,20]</u> Additional studies involving a series of tubes with different diameters, models of ventilation, and application of multiple endoscopic therapies should be performed to determine the most appropriate tube size and length with respect to minimizing carbon dioxide retention and reducing the restenosis rate.\nIn conclusion, flexible BBD with a small-diameter tube is an effective, safe, novel strategy for the management of benign tracheal stenosis. However, close attention should be given to the risk of adverse effects caused by carbon dioxide retention, and application of multiple endoscopic therapies is essential for good long-term treatment effects.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

With the rapid urbanization of the Yangtze Plain, residents living in these areas have undergone a rapid shift from peasant to citizen. Citizens ≥18 years old who had lived in their current area for at least 6 months were selected and invited to participate in the study. Those with severe communication problems, acute illness or those who were unwilling to participate were excluded from the study. The overall response rate was 90.8%.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> A total of 4073 subjects were enrolled from three villages in Shanghai, three villages in Zhejiang Province, and six villages in Jiangxi Province.

Current smoking was defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in one’s lifetime and currently smoking cigarettes.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Standing height and body weight were measured with light clothing and no shoes. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared.\nVenous blood samples were drawn from all subjects after an overnight fast of at least 8 h. The blood samples for the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) assessment were centrifuged at the site of collection within 1 h of collection. Other blood samples were shipped in dry ice within 2 to 4 h of collection to a central laboratory, which was certified by the College of American Pathologists.

None of the samples exhibited values below the detection limits of blood cadmium. The inter-assay coefficient of variation for cadmium was 10%. 25(OH)D was measured with a chemiluminescence assay (Siemens Advia Centaur XP, Munich, Germany). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation for 25(OH)D were 6.25% and 8.33%, respectively. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (MQ- 2000PT, Medconn, Shanghai, China). FPG was measured by a Beckman Coulter AU 680 (Brea, CA, USA).\nIn accordance with the American Diabetes Association 2014 criteria, diabetes was defined as a previous diagnosis by healthcare professionals, FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L, or HbA1c ≥6.5%. According to the World Health Organization, the threshold limit for BCL in the general non-occupational population was less than 5 μg/L. February to March was defined as the winter season. April to June was defined as the spring season.\nAll data management and analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 24 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Two-sided P value <0.05 was considered significant. Continuous variables were shown as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range) based on their distribution style, and categorical variables were described as a percentage. Normality was evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Characteristics of the study sample were compared by analysis of variance for continuous variables with a normal distribution, the Kruskal-Wallis test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables with a skewed distribution, and the Pearson Chi-squared test for categorical variables. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the association of 25(OH)D (outcome) with BCL modeled either as log2-transformed continuous variables or as tertiles (predictors). BCL was log base2- tranformed because of skewed distribution. The data were expressed as unstandardized coefficient (B) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We ran three models with progressive adjustment factors. First, we ran a model unadjusted. Then, we ran a second model adjusted for age (continuous), educational status, current smoking, BMI (continuous), and diabetes (yes or no). The third model was further adjusted for season (February to March, April to June). In the models using tertiles, P for trend was calculated by modeling the tertiles, coded as 1, 2, and 3, as a continuous variable.\nAmong the 3234 adult participants, there were 1245 (38.5%) men and 1989 (61.5%) women. Overall, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <50 nmol/L) was 79.2% in this study population (69.9% in men and 85.0% in women). The medians (interquartile range) of BCL were 1.80 μg/L (0.60-3.42) for men and 1.40 μg/L (0.52-3.10) for women. The abnormal rates of men and women were 9.7% and 8.5%, respectively.

This study is also the first to find an inverse association between BCL and vitamin D in the general population of Chinese adults. This association was independent of age, educational level, current smoking, BMI, diabetes, and season.\nChina has been experiencing urbanization at an unparalleled pace since the 1990s. The Yangtze Plain, the study area of the present paper, boasts a faster rate of urbanization than the national average rate (China City Statistical Yearbook, 2014). Rapid urbanization leads to changes in the lifestyles of the residents.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> An increasing number of people have become reliant on automobiles and can afford computers; and high levels of car and computer use decrease physical activity and increase sedentariness, thus reducing the chance of being exposed to sunlight. Meanwhile, high-calorie fast food enjoys increasing popularity as the numbers of time-poor but income-wealthier urban populations grow, which contributes to the risk of obesity. Less exposure to sunlight and obesity are known risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,24]</u>\nUrbanization not only induces lifestyle changes but also causes changes in the urban environment, including air pollution caused by construction and transportation, arable lands contaminated by heavy metals and irrigation of some paddy fields by industrial wastewaters.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u> Based on the investigation conducted by the Ministry of Land and Resources of China in 2014, approximately 19.4% of the agricultural soils have exceeded the national standards, with cadmium among the most serious pollutants, and the Yangtze Plain is one of the most seriously polluted areas.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Since rice has long been a major staple food for Chinese residents, the consumption of contaminated crops has become a primary route of cadmium exposure for the general non-occupational population in China.通用删除6(英):<u>[27,28]</u> Emerging evidence has shown that in addition to conventional risk factors, various environmental factors termed endocrine-disrupting chemicals can also exert a broad range of actions on the vitamin D endocrine system.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>\nScarce epidemiologic studies have explored the association between cadmium exposure and vitamin D. Our study was consistent with a previous study conducted in Japanese adults who lived near a zinc mine or had itai-itai disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> In this study, cadmium exposure was inversely associated with 1,25(OH)2D. However, Zamoiski et al通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> found that cadmium exposure may not affect vitamin D metabolism. However, this study recruited adolescents from a smelter town in Mexico, and the data may, therefore, not be generalizable to other ages or to populations in areas with different levels of environmental exposure. In addition, this study used urine cadmium, which is believed to represent the body burden of cadmium. Instead, we expand on prior research by using BCL, a marker of recent exposure.\nAlthough mechanistic studies are lacking, it is plausible that cadmium exposure may act either directly or indirectly on the vitamin D endocrine system. First, the liver plays an important role in vitamin D metabolism, since the first hydroxylation occurs in the liver, where cutaneous vitamin D is converted to 25(OH)D, the circulating biomarker of vitamin D status.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> It is well known that the liver is the main target organ for cadmium toxicity.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Hence, it is reasonable to deduce that hepatotoxicity of cadmium may play a role in vitamin D deficiency. In addition, animal and in vitro studies have shown that cadmium can alter the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes,通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32]</u> which are involved in the hydroxylation steps in vitamin D metabolism.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> Why did BCL have sex-specific association with 25(OH)D in our analysis? Reproductive hormones may be involved. It is already known that reproductive hormones are closely related to vitamin D status in men and women.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> Some investigations have also studied the association between BCL and 25(OH)D, although they are limited and inconclusive. Lee et al通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> reported that in men cadmium exposure was not associated with follicle-stimulating hormone. However, in women BCL showed a significant negative association with estradiol.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> Knowledge of this sex-specific association is still very limited and warrants further investigation.\nA growing body of evidence has suggested that there is no safe threshold for cadmium intake.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> Our research provides further evidence that links vitamin D deficiency with blood cadmium at levels that are within the normal range according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of USA (<5 μg/L). Although most of BCLs in our subjects were in the normal range, the medians of BCL (1.50 μg/L) in Chinese residents in the rapidly urbanized Yangtze Plain were still much higher than Americans (0.31 μg/L) based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007 to 2012 data.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> Given that China’s urbanization rate continues to move forward, our findings have implications from a public health perspective. It is now time to pay attention to the quality rather than the pace of urbanization and to take actions to reduce adult cadmium exposure. Large numbers of people are experiencing remarkable lifestyle and environmental changes during the transition of urbanization. These individuals are in urgent need of health education programs to adopt healthy lifestyles. More importantly, these populations should be encouraged to actively engage in environmental monitoring and management.\nThe strengths of our study included our relatively large sample size and the use of community-dwelling population-based data that allowed for the detection of subtle effects between our exposures and outcome of interest. Despite these strengths, our investigation was potentially limited by its cross-sectional design that precluded any conclusions regarding cause-effect relationships.\nOur results provide suggestive evidence that environmental exposure to cadmium may alter serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the general population of Chinese women.

Owing to the high prevalence and poor prognosis of CRC, it is possible to speculate that a potential anti-tumor role of metformin may affect public health.\nSeveral recent observational studies have explored the association between metformin use and clinical outcomes in CRC patients with T2DM. Previous meta-analyses of such studies have been inconclusive, as they mainly focused on the prevention of CRC rather than the survival benefits.9,10,11,12,13,14 Considering this controversial issue, we conducted a systematic review and quantitative analysis of all retrospective cohort studies to determine whether metformin therapy can improve survival in CRC patients with T2DM.\nThis meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline,15 which is a revised edition of Quality of Reporting of Meta-Analyses (QUOROM), to rigorously evaluate its quality.\nThe study did not involve any animals or humans. Therefore, ethical approval was not needed.\nTwo reviewers (Yu-Lan Liu and Hong-Bo Lei) independently searched PubMed, the Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases for all relevant studies up to August 2016. The main search keywords for article title and abstract were \"colorectal cancer\" in combination with \"metformin\" . Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of studies identified in the search to exclude unrelated studies. Two researchers (Yu-Lan Liu and Hong-Bo Lei) screened the full texts and references to determine whether there were any additional studies in line with our inclusion criteria.\nInclusion criteria were: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> study design: retrospective cohort studies; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> participants: patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of CRC and a T2DM diagnosis before the occurrence of CRC; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> treatment group: use of metformin; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> comparison group: non-use of metformin; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> outcomes: hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) and CRC-specific survival (CS). Studies published in English were included. When there were several publications from the same retrospective cohort, we extracted the useful information from the most recent and complete studies. Studies such as letters, reviews, and comments were excluded.\nData extraction was independently performed by two authors (Yu-Lan Liu and Hong-Bo Lei) following a standard form designed in advance. The following information was extracted from the included articles: authors, year, study design, mean age, country, duration of the study, number of events, outcome assessment, HRs with 95% CIs, and CRC stage.\nIn order to better distinguish the quality of the included studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale16 was applied for quality assessment of observational studies. All methodological quality of eligible studies was evaluated separately by two authors (Shan Tian and Yan Chen). Any discrepancies were resolved by a third researcher (Wei-Guo Dong). A total of 9 points were enrolled in the scale, and three aspects were included: selection, comparability, and exposure/outcomes. Studies scoring higher than 7 were regarded as high quality, studies scoring 4-6 were seen as good quality, and studies scoring 3 or below were viewed as low quality studies.\nPooled HRs for OS, CS, and respective 95% CIs were estimated by a random-effects model if the substantial heterogeneity across studies was detected; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was performed. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran's Q statistic17 and I2 statistic. For the Q statistic, P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for heterogeneity. For the I2 statistic, 25-50%, 50-75%, and >75% were regarded as low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively.18 An I2 value of ≥50% indicated significant heterogeneity. The source of heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup analysis. Finally, publication bias was evaluated with the application of the Egger's regression and Begg's test, in which P < 0.05 was considered representative of statistically significant publication bias. All of the statistical analysis was performed using Stata software program version 11.0 (STATA, College Station, TX, USA).\nThe literature search yielded 81 studies, and 8 observational studies19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 were included in this meta-analysis . These studies cumulatively included 6098 cases of CRC patients with T2DM who used metformin and 4954 cases of CRC patients with T2DM who did not use metformin. None of these 8 selected studies was industry sponsored.\nThe characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1.

Seven studies19,20,21,22,24,25,26 reported the HRs for OS among CRC patients with T2DM, and four studies19,21,23,25 reported the HRs for CS among CRC patients with T2DM. Of the included studies, four19,20,22,23 were performed in Europe (Ireland, Netherlands, Denmark, UK), and three21,24,26 in the United States. The remaining one was performed in Korea.25 As shown in Table 2, all of the studies scored 6 or higher, suggesting that these studies were of high quality.\nCharacteristics of studies included in the meta-analysis evaluating the outcomes of CRC patients treated with metformin.\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of studies included in the meta-analysis evaluating the outcomes of CRC patients treated with metformin.</u>\nCRC: colorectal cancer; HR: hazard ratio; CI: confidence interval; OS: overall survival; CS: CRC-specific survival; RCS: retrospective cohort study; -: no data.\nMethodological quality of retrospective cohort studies.\n删除重复语句：<u>Methodological quality of retrospective cohort studies.</u>\nMetformin use was associated with an 18% lower HR for OS (HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.77-0.87, P = 0.000) compared with non-metformin use among T2DM patients . As there was no significant evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 48.1%; P = 0.073), subgroup analysis was not necessary. We performed sensitivity analyses by excluding one study at a time and recalculating the pooled HRs for the remaining studies, and the results demonstrated that the overall pooled estimates were robust. There was no significant publication bias by funnel plot . We did not detect any publication bias based by Egger's test (t = -2.04, P = 0.097) or Begg's test (Z = 0.60, P = 0.548).\nThe pooled HR for CS was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69-1.02, P = 0.079), with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 47.7%, P = 0.125) . Subgroup analysis was not performed since there was no evidence of heterogeneity. As only four studies reported CS, it was difficult to confirm whether publication bias existed in our meta-analysis.\nOur meta-analysis of observational studies explored the association between metformin treatment and CRC outcomes in patients with T2DM, and determined that metformin use improves the OS of CRC patients, but it cannot prolong the CS of CRC patients with T2DM.\nThe study of Miranda et al27 suggested that metformin together with conventional chemotherapy could be an effective treatment regimen for CRC patients with T2DM. Other previous studies found that metformin can improve the survival outcomes of patients with T2DM.9,28 He et al9 conducted a meta-analysis, which included six studies, to assess the correlation between metformin use and survival in CRC patients. This meta-analysis revealed an improved OS for metformin users among CRC patients compared with non-users (HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.58-0.81). Mei et al28 also performed a meta-analysis that included 2461 cases of patients from six retrospective cohort studies. From this study, they drew the conclusion that metformin can reduce the risk of all causes of death by 44% (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.41-0.77) and the risk of CRC-specific death by 34% (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50-0.87) in CRC patients compared to non-users. However, the previous meta-analyses are relatively inconclusive with limited number of included studies. More recently, several relevant large-scale studies have been published, so we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim to draw a definite conclusion. The results of the present study were in line with the previous ones.\nThe possible anti-tumor mechanisms of metformin are thought to be because of suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in the cellular protein translational machinery and cell proliferation.29 Metformin can inhibit proliferation, metastasis, and invasion of tumor cells, as well as induce tumor cells to undergo apoptosis under high glucose conditions through activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mTOR signaling.30,31,32 It has also been shown to block the effect of a high-energy diet on tumor cell growth, reduce insulin resistance, and alleviate the overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FASN).33,34 Additionally, metformin, as an antitumor agent, exhibits a synergist effect with other chemotherapeutic drugs and cytotoxic effect on cancer stem cells.35 Furthermore, hyperglycemia is a basic feature of T2MD, considered as a risk factor for the occurrence and development of CRC. High glucose environment leads to aberrant glycosylation, cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis of CRC.36 Metformin decreases the level of blood glucose by inhibiting liver glucose production and increasing the sensitivity of insulin to the target organs, thus suppressing the hyperglycemia-induced carcinogenesis.\nHowever, our study had several limitations that merit further consideration. First, our results were based on information from observational studies, and no feasible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Observational studies have methodological shortcomings, and are prone to time-related biases, such as immortal time bias and time-lagging issues.37 Second, some studies did not adjust for potential confounding factors, such as obesity, CRC stage, population source, and other anti-diabetic medications. Third, the included studies were limited in reporting the dose of metformin among CRC patients with T2DM, so we could not do a subgroup meta-analysis according to metformin dose. Additionally, the studies did not report the effects of any side effects or duration of metformin use on CRC survival. Hence, the observed benefits from duration of metformin use cannot be clearly defined and we cannot completely evaluate its safety. Finally, our analysis was confined to English language studies, so publication bias may have been introduced.\nThis meta-analysis provides evidence that metformin use can reduce all-cause death among T2DM patients. Well-designed cohort studies and RCTs are needed to confirm these findings and further explore the efficacy and safety of this anti-tumor medicine.\nAll authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2017.06.001</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

However, statin-associated skeletal muscle complaints hinder their clinical application to some extent. Yang xin shi tablet (YXST), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, can effectively improve the clinical symptoms of patients with cardiovascular diseases when combined with conventional drugs. However, the synergistic effects of YXST combined with a statin and the potential mechanisms remain unknown. Hence, exploring the effects and mechanisms of YXST in improving statin-induced muscle injury can be beneficial for the exercise rehabilitation and prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease.\nHigh-fat diet-fed apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice (Vital River, Beijing, China) were raised in the specific pathogen-free housing. After 4 weeks, the ApoE-/- mice were randomly divided into four groups of six mice each: exercise, exercise + simvastatin (SMV), exercise + SMV + low dose of YXST (LYXST), and exercise + SMV + high dose of YXST (HYXST). Experimental mice were given running exercise and administrated 20 mg/kg SMV (Merck, St. Louis, MO, USA), SMV + 750 mg/kg YXST (Growful, Qingdao, China), or SMV + 1500 mg/kg YXST by gavage for 8 weeks. Exercise capacity was evaluated at the end of the treatment using the running tolerance test (ZhiShuDuoBao, Beijing, China). Moreover, total cholesterol and creatine kinase concentrations were measured at the end of treatment. Muscle morphology was assessed by section staining of the gastrocnemius (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Energy metabolism was assessed by glycogen reserves in the gastrocnemius (Solarbio). Mitochondrial complex III activity (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was measured to evaluate mitochondrial function. Western blot assays were performed using the following antibodies: anti-adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-p-AMPK (Abcam), anti-PGC-1α (Abcam), and anti-p-PGC-1α (Abcam) antibodies. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction kits (Yeasen, Shanghai, China) were used to determine the expression levels of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). The murine primer sequences are as follows: NRF1, forward primer 5′-GGTGGGGGACAGATAGTCCT-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCTGTCCGATATCCTGGTGG-3′; TFAM, forward primer 5′-TCACCCTATCTTGGGGTCATC-3′, reverse primer 5′-GGGATTTGCCAGCTCAAAGTG-3′; β-actin, forward primer 5′-CTGTCCCTGTATGCCTCTG-3′, reverse primer 5′-ATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The significance level was tested using a one-way analysis of variance. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nWe found that YXST neither affected the plasma lipid levels nor interfered with the hypolipidemic effects of SMV on ApoE-/- mice (41.68 ± 9.62 vs. 22.54 ± 2.76, P < 0.05; 41.68 ± 9.62 vs. 25.75 ± 3.21, P < 0.05; 41.68 ± 9.62 vs. 22.51 ± 2.01, P < 0.05). Our results also showed that YXST improved simvastatin-induced exercise intolerance (652.50 ± 169.40 vs. 1095.25 ± 237.10, P < 0.05; 652.50 ± 169.40 vs. 1030.80 ± 150.28, P < 0.05). To confirm the protective effects of YXST on muscle, we observed changes in histomorphology and found that ApoE-/- mice in the exercise + SMV + HYXST groups had more dense muscle fibers than those in the exercise + SMV group. In addition, YXST could remove the elevation of plasma creatine kinase induced by SMV (0.91 ± 0.20 vs. 0.38 ± 0.06, P < 0.05; 0.91 ± 0.20 vs. 0.35 ± 0.06, P < 0.05), indicating that YXST can effectively inhibit the myolysis caused by statin.\nStatin reduces the substrate energy metabolism during aerobic exercise.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The PAS staining showed a significantly reduced content of muscle glycogen upon YXST treatment in ApoE-/- mice with exercise training with SMV gavage. Mitochondrial complex III was the off-target of statin, and its activity was reduced in patients with statin-induced myopathy.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Thus, our results showed that the complex III activity of SMV-treated mice decreased, which was restored by YXST (5.72 ± 0.80 vs. 2.06 ± 0.85, P < 0.05; 2.06 ± 0.85 vs. 11.51 ± 1.97, P < 0.05; 2.06 ± 0.85 vs. 8.21 ± 1.77, P < 0.05).\nOn the basis of the above results, we further explored the potential mechanisms involved. We found that YXST increased the phosphorylation of AMPK (0.46 ± 0.08 vs. 0.64 ± 0.09, P < 0.05) and PGC-1α (0.70 ± 0.10 vs. 0.87 ± 0.09, P < 0.05; 0.70 ± 0.10 vs. 0.88 ± 0.07, P < 0.05) and up-regulated the expression of NRF1 (0.64 ± 0.07 vs. 0.87 ± 0.09, P < 0.05). Ultimately, it acted on some factors, such as TFAM (0.69 ± 0.09 vs. 1.20 ± 0.11, P < 0.05; 0.69 ± 0.09 vs. 1.03 ± 0.13, P < 0.05), to increase energy metabolism.

However, there are few reports till date on the comprehensive evaluation of symptoms and risks in COPD patients with radiographic bronchiectasis.

Results of this study will also provide valuable information for the better control of COPD progression.\nA total of 461 patients who attended the COPD outpatient clinic of our hospital from May 2012 to April 2014, with established disease archives, were enrolled in this survey. All recruited patients complied with the COPD diagnostic criteria that is, the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s to the forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) should be less than 70% following bronchodilator inhalation, and were stable at the time of the test.

The proportions of type D was higher in the bronchiectasis group (50%) than in the group without bronchiectasis (35.7%), and the difference was statistically significant (χ2 = 4.52, P = 0.033) .\nComparison of comprehensive clinical evaluation results of the bronchiectasis group and the group without bronchiectasis.\n删除重复语句：<u>Comparison of comprehensive clinical evaluation results of the bronchiectasis group and the group without bronchiectasis.</u>\nBMI: body mass index; FEV1: forced expiratory volume in 1 s; FVC: forced vital capacity; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CAT: COPD assessment test; mMRC: modified medical research council.\nAll numbers shown are mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise specified as number (%).\nat test, measurement data.\nb χ2 test, categorical variable.\nClassic bronchiectasis is a well-known entity.14 In recent years, with the widespread use of chest HRCT, many subclinical radiological changes have been detected, one of which is called radiographic bronchiectasis. Classic bronchiectasis and radiographic bronchiectasis pertain to the same kind of anatomopathological changes and have similar radiographic appearances. Bronchiectasis was not included among the comorbidities of COPD patients in GOLD 2011 or GOLD 2013.14,15,16 The GOLD 2014 amendment clearly pointed out that COPD complications should include bronchiectasis, which mainly refers to radiographic bronchiectasis. However, the effects of radiographic bronchiectasis on the assessment of disease condition, risk of future attacks of AECOPD, and prognosis of COPD have not been described. Therefore, an in-depth study on this issue is necessary.\nThe data in Table 2 show that, the mMRC scores and the proportion of patients with CAT ≥ 10 in the bronchiectasis group were significantly higher than those in the group without bronchiectasis. The results of this study indicated that co-existed radiographic bronchiectasis can significantly influence the severity of the clinical symptoms of COPD patients. If the smoking factor is adjusted for, the symptom scores in the two groups may differ more significantly. More complications were found in the bronchiectasis group than in the group without bronchiectasis. Although the mechanism is unclear, it is certain that radiographic bronchiectasis can affect the severity and prognosis of COPD patients. The data in Table 2 indicate that the FEV1 % predicted value of the bronchiectasis group was significantly lower than that of the group without bronchiectasis although the percentage of smokers and the smoking index in the without bronchiectasis group were significantly higher than in the bronchiectasis group. This may further demonstrate that the disease severity in the bronchiectasis group may be greater than that in the group without bronchiectasis. More importantly, this may indicate that the future risk of AECOPD in COPD patients may be significantly higher in the bronchiectasis group than that in the group without bronchiectasis. This has important significance in the prediction and prevention of AECOPD.\nWhat were interested in is whether the symptoms of concomitant radiographic bronchiectasis can also affect the COPD disease grouping. The results indicated that the percentage of type D patients in the bronchiectasis group was significantly higher than that in the group without bronchiectasis. This has important clinical significance. The grouping into A, B, C, and D is mainly used for guiding the establishment of clinical treatment principles and regimens, hence even when there are no significant clinical symptoms and signs in those patients with radiographic bronchiectasis, the co-existence of radiographic bronchiectasis with COPD has important clinical significance.\nNevertheless, this study also has some limitations. Among the 461 patients with established archives of disease in the COPD clinic, only 347 patients had undergone HRCT examination. The proportion of males among the recruited patients was higher than that among the non-recruited patients, and the FEV1 % predicted value was lower than that in the non-recruited patients. Small cylindrical bronchiectasis in only one single pulmonary segment is common in healthy adults.17 The effects of different severities of bronchiectasis on COPD symptoms and risks need to be studied further. In spite of this, we believe that the co-existence of radiographic bronchiectasis has important significance in the COPD assessment for evaluating the future risk, and determining the clinical treatment. A chest HRCT is recommended whenever possible to determine the co-existence of radiographic bronchiectasis in COPD patients.\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\nThis study was supported by a grant from the Peking University People's Hospital Research and Development Fund (Project number: RDC2011-26).\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2017.02.007</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The results of the six scoping reviews published in this special issue provide a clear picture of the available knowledge on each of the themes and highlight knowledge gaps, as well as needs and opportunities for further research. Based on the results of the scoping reviews, and to produce a list of priority research needs to be addressed in this area, the concept mapping method was used.

In this context of growing attention from research and international organizations on emerging and re-emerging VBDs, it is important to establish research priorities so that international collaborative efforts can be focused on the most urgent issues to rapidly improve the prevention and control of these diseases and their vectors. However, a literature search found no recent scientific publications (less than 3 years old) on collaborative process to determine research priorities. The purpose of the project highlighted in this report on in this special issue, therefore, is to provide rigorous evidence to inform research institutions and donor agencies about knowledge gaps and research priorities through an innovative three-step process (international eDelphi consultation, six scoping reviews, and concept mapping) that combines knowledge synthesis with the expertise and engagement of international public health researchers and decision-makers.\nThis article presents the final step in the process of identifying research priorities on VBDs and other diseases of poverty in the urban context.

To carry out this research prioritization exercise using the concept mapping method, members of the six research teams responsible for the \"VEctor boRne DiseAses Scoping reviews\" (VERDAS) consortium’s scoping reviews met for 2 days with decision-makers from Colombia, Brazil, and Peru, as well as with representatives from the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) and WHO/the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR).\nThe concept mapping method developed by Trochim 通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u> was adapted 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> and carried out using an analysis module specially designed by Provalis Research© 删除6：<u></u>. The technique organizes qualitative data using a series of statistical analyses. A total of 11 researchers and seven decision-makers completed the concept mapping exercise .

Given the large number of scientific publications that have described this method , only the essential elements of the procedure are reported here.\nFirst, participants generated a list of items during a brainstorming session to answer the question: \"In view of the knowledge synthesis (that you conducted) AND your own expertise, what do we still need to know about vector-borne diseases and other infectious diseases of poverty in urban areas?\" A list of 97 statements was produced during this first session.The statements were then printed on individual cards and in list form. This material was given to each participant. Working individually, participants rated each of the 97 statements on two scales of 1 to 5 (5 being the most important); one scale was related to 'priority’ and the other to 'policy relevance’. Lastly, they sorted the statements, grouping cards together in piles based on their own individual criteria and expertise.These data were entered into the software, after which statistical analyses (hierarchical cluster analysis [HCA], multidimensional scaling, average scores assigned to each of the items) were conducted to produce a preliminary map. HCA made it possible to produce any number of clusters, from 97, in which each statement would be its own 'cluster’, to a single cluster grouping them all. The researchers in charge of the operation (Dagenais, Ridde, Degroote) then met to examine the content of the clusters produced and determine their optimal number. These decisions were based on a consensus from an empirical and heuristic standpoint. Besides a visual examination of the cluster contents and their relative importance, a statistical index provided information to help with interpretation. This was a specificity score, which is generally greater than 1, and which indicates the strength of an item’s association with a cluster. The higher the number, the more this item will be representative of the overall idea emanating from the cluster. Content analysis of the clusters continued until a final map emerged that everyone agreed was representative of the key dimensions. A 12-cluster solution was chosen, and conceptual labels were attached to each cluster based on the overall meaning of the constituent statements.At another meeting these results were presented and discussed with all participants to ensure that the 12-cluster solution was agreed to by all participants.\nFirst, participants generated a list of items during a brainstorming session to answer the question: \"In view of the knowledge synthesis (that you conducted) AND your own expertise, what do we still need to know about vector-borne diseases and other infectious diseases of poverty in urban areas?\" A list of 97 statements was produced during this first session.\nThe statements were then printed on individual cards and in list form.

To determine the number of strata, the difference between the means of the highest and the lowest clusters was divided into three intervals. Thus, the \"Technologies\" , \"Equity\" , and \"Surveillance\" clusters were considered by participants to be the highest priority clusters. On the other hand, the \"Population mobility\" and \"Collaboration\" clusters were considered to be the lowest priority but remained identified by participants as research priorities. All other clusters were considered of medium importance.\nThe complete list of statements (ranked by importance ratings) for each cluster is presented in 通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 2: Table S1. This table presents priority and policy relevance ratings for each item and averages for each cluster. These ratings are very similar for all clusters.</u>\nThe average policy relevance scores of each of the 12 clusters is roughly the same as priority scores for all clusters. Only marginal differences are observed for the number of strata attributed to the \"Intervention\" and \"Community & Society\" clusters, which are considered more relevant and get one more stratum, while the \"Vectors\" and \"Clinic\" clusters get one less stratum on the policy relevance score.\nThe number of items per cluster is very heterogeneous, ranging from two items for the \"Technologies\" cluster to 23 items for the \"Interventions\" cluster. Based on priority scores, the most important cluster is the \"Equity\" cluster (3.83), which groups three items on integrating social determinants into the different facets of VBD research. The next cluster, \"Technologies\" (3.62), has only two items dealing with the integration of new technologies and their acceptability (including new vaccines). It should be noted that another item dealing with acceptability was placed in the \"Interventions\" cluster and concerns the consideration of social acceptability when designing interventions. In the \"Surveillance\" cluster (3.49), which consists of 16 items, a strong need was identified for knowledge around the detection of epidemics. Items include the need to improve surveillance systems in the light of recent developments (new technologies, big data, and geographical information) and scaling up and harmonizing these systems and protocols at the national and international levels to foster better international collaboration. Some items also focus on the performance of systems to identify the most vulnerable areas and on the use and transfer of information to decision-makers. With respect to the 23 items in the \"Interventions\" cluster (3.45), most knowledge needs identified by participants relate to evaluating interventions, including the integration of multilevel analyses (individual, community, population) and the improvement of effectiveness measures for different types of interventions. Several items deal with research on the implementation of interventions and, in particular, on the integration of interdisciplinary and multi-disease approaches and sustainability. This result highlights the complexity of the interventions. Finally, the issue of the roles of industry and governments in the procurement of vector control tools is highlighted. The \"Ethics\" cluster (3.44) contains three rather vague items on the need to identify the different ethical dimensions associated with research on VBDs. In the \"Transmission & Interaction\" cluster (3.37), the nine items summarize knowledge needs for a better understanding of different transmission routes, of co-circulation and co-infection of different viruses, and of the factors associated with lethality and congenital syndromes. The \"Community & Society\" cluster (3.31) grouped seven items on the role and capacity-building of communities to address VBDs, as well as on education and training issues for children and health professionals. The \"Vectors\" cluster (3.26) contains seven items covering, on one hand, the biology and behaviour of vectors and, on the other, the use of entomological indices for predicting epidemics and their limitations. The \"City responsibility\" cluster (3.20) includes nine items on the impact of urban development and how to integrate the fight against VBDs into sustainable urban planning (including waste management and sanitation issues). This cluster also includes questions about collaboration between the various municipal departments and the impact of climate change. In the \"Clinics\" cluster (3.16), the vast majority of the 10 items focus on the development, use, and validation of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and other diagnostic methods, including the need for biomarkers. The four items in the \"Collaboration\" cluster (3.08) focus on how to make research more responsive to emergencies and health priorities. Finally, the \"Population mobility\" cluster (2.71), with four items, deals with evaluating the role of mobility in the spread of VBDs and the preventive means that could be used. Participants gave this issue the lowest priority.\nTable 2 provides a list of the statements with the highest ratings on both priority and policy relevance. These 10 statements fall into six different clusters: \"Interventions\" , \"Community & Society\" , \"Equity\" , \"Ethics\" , \"City responsibility\" , and \"Surveillance\" . It should be noted that four of them come from the \"Interventions\" cluster. The average importance of the statements in this cluster was re-calculated without including these four statements. The results showed that they did not influence the number of strata allocated to this cluster. In other words, they did not inflate the mean value of this category. This is not surprising given the large number of items in this cluster. Table 2 also shows that the average scores attributed to priority and policy relevance are generally very close together and none exceeds half a point. In other words, for the concept mapping participants, research priorities were also policy-relevant.\nStatements with the highest \"Priority\" and \"Policy relevance\" ratings\n删除重复语句：<u>Statements with the highest \"Priority\" and \"Policy relevance\" ratings</u>\nVBDs Vector-borne diseases\nFinally, Table 3 presents the 10 statements with the lowest priority and policy relevance ratings. They are divided into seven different clusters: \"Ethics\" , \"Population mobility\" , \"City responsibility\" , \"Transmission & Interaction\" , \"Vectors\" , \"Collaboration\" , and \"Clinics\" . Two come from the \"Vectors\" cluster and three from the \"Clinics\" cluster. However, even if these items had been excluded, the average scores for these two clusters would not have reduced their relative importance significantly enough to move to a single stratum in the final map . As with the top 10 items, there is no significant difference between the priority and policy relevance ratings.\nStatements with the lowest priority and policy relevance ratings\n删除重复语句：<u>Statements with the lowest priority and policy relevance ratings</u>\nRDTs Rapid diagnostic tests, VBDs Vector-borne diseases\nThe starting point for this concept mapping exercise was the work of six research teams that carried out six scoping reviews on selected themes following an extensive expert consensus technique using the Delphi method. Based on this work, and from a participatory standpoint, the aim of the concept mapping exercise was to identify, in a collaborative process involving researchers from these teams and high-level decision-makers, the research themes for which studies should be carried out as a priority.\nIdentifying research priorities is a major challenge for researchers and potential users of research results. Prioritization approaches use a variety of more or less structured methods: a working group to take stock of the state of knowledge and recommend research activities to be prioritized 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>; broad unstructured consultations of international experts 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>; meeting of specialists to gather their views and experiences on the topic under consideration 通用删除6(英):<u>[27,28]</u>; and conducting extensive polling surveys 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>, combined with focus groups 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. Some activities of the same type use more structured methods, such as the one developed by the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative Method, in which several experts generate and score research options against a set of criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32,33]</u>; others use the nominal group technique 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. To determine the topics of the six scoping reviews in this project, the Delphi technique was used 通用删除6(英):<u>[35,36]</u>.\nThe cluster considered the most important concerns equity issues, confirming that these issues are rarely addressed in research on VBDs. As is often the case in public health, equity is set aside for research on the effectiveness of interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. However, when it comes to VBDs, the poorest communities and individuals are often the most affected 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>, with an even more unbalanced distribution of risk among children, women of childbearing age, and the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>[38,39,40,41]</u>. Yet, programs and policies for VBD prevention and control are still all too often designed to meet the needs of the population as a whole without taking into account the unequal distribution of risks among this population 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. The fight against Zika was not seized by health actors as an opportunity to fight against injustices and promote equity 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>. As the 10th anniversary of the WHO Commission report 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> on the social determinants of health is celebrated, this study shows that the needs for equity are still enormous. For example, a few interventions to combat VBDs have been developed with a view to achieving proportionate universalism, as widely recommended today 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>. This concept mapping exercise therefore shows that, in the fight against VBDs, equity issues must now be front-and-centre, and that more research projects should be developed to understand how to integrate social determinants more effectively into public health programs and policies.\nThe second and third highest priority clusters are about new technologies and surveillance. These are fundamental issues. Once again, recent international epidemics have highlighted the strengths and limitations of current surveillance systems 通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> and the need for early detection of outbreaks 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>. An effective surveillance system should collect and analyze reliable data to produce relevant information for sharing with those who can promote new public health policies and implement prevention and control strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u>. Today, however, several of these elements are still lacking or need to be improved, particularly by using new technologies, as was attempted in Burkina Faso by members of our team 通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>. The Ebola crisis in West Africa has shown that surveillance systems are not always adequate 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>. As mentioned in the scoping review on surveillance systems, there is an important need for innovative research to take into account the ever-expanding environmental, social, and health changes in urban areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. From the concept mapping exercise and conversations among participants, it also emerged that one of the top research priorities is to identify relevant and realistic thresholds for early detection of epidemics and to support the implementation of control actions. As such, in a context of rapid technological development, it is important to fund initiatives that integrate new information and communications technologies (ICTs) to improve surveillance systems, such as the use of smartphone applications and services 通用删除6(英):<u>[51,52]</u> or big data (geographic and demographic) 通用删除6(英):<u>[53,54]</u>.\nAlthough no bioethicist was included in the group of participants, which is regrettable, the issue of ethics in the fight against VBDs emerged as a research priority. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the ethical considerations to be taken into account, particularly in prevention and control interventions. As mentioned, the ethical issue was approached from the perspective of social justice and equity. It is therefore not only a question of traditional procedural ethics, but also of how interventions can be formulated and implemented in this ethical perspective 通用删除6(英):<u>[55,56]</u>. A list of criteria public health actors could apply when considering the ethical aspects of their interventions was also proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>.\nIntervention research is another priority, particularly on vector control interventions. As shown in the scoping reviews on containment measures 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> and household prevention 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>, it is somewhat surprising to note how little is known about the effectiveness and implementation of interventions when the critical role vectors play in VBD transmission has long been known. There is a critical need for funding and publications of complex interventions of high methodological quality in order to provide the evidence necessary for decision-makers to implement new public health policies 通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>. There is also an urgent need to improve the methods of evaluating interventions, which are all too often simplistic, whereas interventions are increasingly complex and multidisciplinary 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Innovative approaches based on validated theories and mixed methods are urgently needed 通用删除6(英):<u>[59,60,61]</u>. The problem of the social acceptability of interventions has been highlighted, and this question has still not been sufficiently studied by researchers. Recent methodological advances 通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63]</u> will be useful for empirical testing in this field. Moreover, the research on interventions that comply with methodological gold standards is very costly and requires significant funding over several years. It is therefore important to have a real investment from the scientific and political communities and funding agencies to provide solid evidence quickly to guide future public health policies 通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>.\nThe list of items proposed during the brainstorming was, of course, influenced by the expertise of the participants present and the preparatory work of the six scoping reviews, whose topics were chosen by the eDelphi panel from more than 120 proposals. It is obvious that the list of items could not be exhaustive, and the subjects of the six scoping reviews are very well represented (interventions, surveillance, diagnosis, transmission). It is therefore also interesting to revisit some topics that were not mentioned during the concept mapping but were raised in the eDelphi consultation at the beginning of the project. Governance issues were not addressed during the concept mapping, nor were access and quality of care. Issues related to the development and distribution of new vaccines were mentioned in a single item on the acceptability of these new treatments. There was also very little discussion of antibiotic and pesticide resistance during the exercise, and so this was not directly reflected in the research priorities identified, although it underlies several themes discussed (particularly in the clusters on interventions and new technologies). The issue of costs and economic analysis did not appear as a separate theme but was integrated into the cluster on interventions. Economic issues were therefore not identified as a research priority as such, but should be given greater consideration in the design and analysis of future interventions. Public policies, sustainability, the institutionalization of vector control, and the role of intersectorality were poorly noted during the Delphi consultation and did not appear as research priorities during the concept mapping exercise. Finally, it was surprising that the issue of climate change appeared only twice in the concept mapping and was not more preponderant, given that it is at the heart of contemporary debates. 通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u>. All these issues would certainly have been raised if the panel had included economists, climatologists, vaccinologists, or even experts in health systems.\nThe concept mapping method used has many strengths and benefits. Previous work from authors with concept mapping 通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18,23,63,64,65]</u> and their review 通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> of 190 articles published since 1989 show that it: 1) combines qualitative and quantitative data; 2) provides images or configurations that simultaneously represent the main concepts, ideas, phenomena or dimensions at stake and their relative importance; 3) requires relatively few resources and is achieved in a few days only; 4) has many benefits for participants (sense of cohesion, belonging, discussion and sharing of opinions and ideas); 5) produces useful results, in the language of the participants and that 6) the participants appreciate the collaborative process; 7) provides equal weight to the views of each participant in the statistical calculations; and 8) helps to minimize the researchers’ biases. However, this method also presents its share of difficulties and limitations, such as: 1) poor external validity, since it is not clear whether the results produced apply to other areas or problems; 2) difficulty in forming representative groups; 3) constraints imposed during brainstorming (formulation of statements related to a specific issue, without the opportunity to discuss or debate), which can cause frustration; 4) the need to recruit an experienced facilitator; 5) the difficulty of formulating a clear and unambiguous question that covers the entire field explored.\nThis exercise brought together participants from a variety of disciplines, countries, and organizations. Regrettably, there were no decision-makers from Africa or Asia, although researchers working in these regions were present. The approach made the identified research priorities more relevant, but at the same time may have introduced some bias in favour of intervention and surveillance research, as the researchers and decision-makers participating were particularly active in this area. These are the clusters with the greatest number of items, and while this certainly corresponds to priority research needs, it is also possible that this may reflect the networks of researchers who took the initiative to respond to the WHO call 通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>.\nThe purpose of this concept mapping exercise was to determine research priorities in the control and prevention of VBDs in urban areas. This collective exercise identified 12 categories of themes for which research still provides too few answers. The question now is how research funding agencies and researchers in the field will use the results of this exercise to guide future work. The challenge is to put forward a knowledge transfer strategy for this project. With this in mind, the study protocol submitted to the WHO call included a plan to produce a policy brief for each scoping review, addressed to potential users of these results. To prepare these briefs, a member of the team, a knowledge transfer specialist, provided training and coaching. These briefs, written in plain language and presented in an attractive format, will summarize the results of the scoping reviews and propose operational recommendations for their implementation. In the view of the authors, these transfer tools may be useful, but only to the extent that they are included in a structured knowledge transfer mechanism.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Multilingual abstracts in the six official working languages of the United Nations.

Several syndromes are associated with the RecQ helicase gene family, including Werner syndrome, Bloom syndrome, and RTS, which are associated with pathogenic variants in the WRN, BLM, and RECQL4 genes, respectively.6,7,8 Mutations in RECQL4 have been identified not only in the majority of patients with RTS but also in patients with RAPADILINO syndrome.9 These helicases participate in diverse DNA metabolic activities such as DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and repair through their DNA-unwinding function. In particular, RECQL4 plays multifaceted roles in maintaining the genomic stability of telomeres and the nuclear and mitochondrial integrity of normal cells and cancer cells.删除4：<u>10</u>\nIntriguingly, RecQL4 consists of 1,208 amino acids and is characterized by the highly conserved RecQ helicase domain (encoded by exons 8-14), while the N-terminus and C-terminus are unique among the RecQ family. The Sld2-like N-terminus (1-388 amino acid residues) of the protein is necessary for the initiation of DNA replication.10 A nuclear targeting signal and a mitochondrial localization sequence have been found within the N-terminus. The C-terminus with a RecQ4-Zn2+-binding domain (836-1,045 amino acid residues) lacks structural resemblance to the conserved RecQ C-terminal (RQC) domain, yet it is functionally comparable with the other RecQ helicases as an essential part of the catalytic core.删除4：<u>11,12</u>\nWe herein report on two unrelated families with RTS-II-affected members, highlighting the mild clinical manifestation depending on the strength of the underlying pathogenic variants and their heterozygous combination.

She was the only child of non-consanguineous parents. Since the age of 8 months, the child had shown erythema on the cheeks that subsequently spread to both ears. At the age of 4 years, poikiloderma, mostly restricted to the face, was clearly apparent. However, no similar lesion was detected in other parts of the skin, including sun-exposed areas. In addition, photosensitivity and heat sensitivity were noted starting at an early age. The patient showed no abnormalities in growth parameters (height, 100 cm; weight, 15.2 kg), skin annexes, eyes, or hematologic function. The orthopedic doctors found no obvious skeletal defects, but tiny skeletal deformities could not be excluded unless a comprehensive computed tomography examination had been performed. The onset of poikiloderma on the face and ears was this patient’s unique clinical phenotype .\nThe propositus was a young girl, the second child of healthy unrelated parents. Persistent erythema on her cheeks had been present since the age of 5 months, accompanied by sensitivity to sun and heat exposure. By the age of 21 months, which was the time of clinical diagnosis and molecular diagnosis of RTS, the malar erythema had developed to true poikiloderma and spread to her distal arms and legs, exhibiting a pattern of reticulated hypo/hyperpigmentation, thin desquamation, mild atrophy, and telangiectases . Conversely, she showed no hair defects, nail or teeth abnormalities, growth retardation, or other dysfunctions. The patient’s clinical signs were mainly restricted to the skin. The first child and parents in the family B are normal.\nBiallelic alterations in the RECQL4 gene were found in both patients by employing a multi-gene panel strategy.\nIn Family A, the RECQL4 molecular study showed that the proband was compound heterozygous for the paternally inherited c.2885+1G>A in intervening sequence (IVS) 16 and the maternally inherited c.2272C>T in exon 14 . The maternally inherited mutation is a transition predicted to result in a stop codon at residue 758 , which has been previously reported.13 Amplification of the cDNA portion of c.2885+1G>A in the small IVS16 (72 nucleotides) allowed retrieval of two different RECQL4 amplicons: the expected transcript with exon 15-16 junction and an aberrant transcript resulting from exons 16 and 17 skipping . The skipped transcript carried the in-frame exon 16-17 deletion and, if translated, would encode a protein lacking 100 amino acids .\nIn the proband of Family B, the paternally inherited classical splicing mutation c.2886-1G>A was identified in IVS16 of RECQL4, and the maternally inherited nonsense mutation c.2752G>T was identified in exon 15 . The maternally inherited mutation was a transition predicted to result in a stop codon at residue 918 . Sequencing of the amplification of the cDNA portion of c.2886-1G>A revealed the insertion of the whole IVS16 between the sequences of exon 15 and 16 . The altered mRNA would be translated into a truncated protein lacking 246 amino acids. At the time of this writing, neither variant had been reported in the literature in individuals with RECQL4-related diseases.\nRTS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with clinical features consisting of poikiloderma, skeletal abnormalities, sparse hair, absent or scanty eyelashes and eyebrows, short stature, and a high risk of developing osteosarcoma and other cancers. However, the two patients described herein presented with a phenotype mainly restricted to cutaneous alterations; therefore, they were considered to have the mild type of RTS. Nevertheless, careful follow-up of these patients is needed because of the early stage of their disease.\nWe reviewed the reported mutations from previous literature, including missense/nonsense mutations, splicing mutations, small deletions and insertions, small indels, and gross deletions. The structure of RECQL4 has been long known to render this gene prone to mis-splicing. We found 21 different splice mutations in RECQL4.\nIn this study, we identified four pathogenic RECQL4 variants in two Chinese patients with clinically suspected RTS from two unrelated families. As previously described, the c.2272C>T alteration could lead to the specific upregulation of a novel RECQL4 physiological alternative transcript, likely encoding a protein isoform with residual activity; this may offset the dearth of the canonical transcript and account for the mild clinical phenotype.14 The novel nonsense mutation c.2752G>T is expected to result in premature termination of protein translation .\nThe genetic mechanism of the two novel splice-site mutations (c.2885+1G>A and c.2886-1G>A) in the same intron of RECQL4 is described as follows. Analysis of the transcripts of the novel splice-site mutation (c.2885+1G>A) found in a 4-year-old Chinese girl showed the product of a two-exon skip. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of multiple-exon skipping as the pathogenic basis for RTS. It is conceivable that the c.2885+1G>A mutation might lead to aberrant splicing due to abolishment of the splice site. However, the mechanism by which the mutation leads to skipping of both exons in the transcript remains unknown. There is strong evidence to support the theory that the order and speed of splicing are important determinants of mRNA transcripts with multiple-exon skipping.15,16,17 However, it is difficult to apply the argument to this splicing. Additionally, the poor fit of the splice-donor site and the donor-site consensus sequence cannot explain the skip.18,19 However, increasing evidence shows that the RNA-specific secondary structure influences the splicing machinery and plays an important role in exon definition for particular transcripts.20Therefore, the fact that the splice mutation skipped exons 16 and 17 might be explained by the change in the splice direction (which may have been caused by the alteration of the specific secondary RNA structure).\nThe other splice-site variant, c.2886-1G>A, caused insertion of the whole IVS16, which caused premature translation that led to the production of a truncated protein. This was caused by the mutation within a donor splice site, which then \"weakened\" this splice site in some way and led to the insertion of IVS16 in mRNA.删除4：<u>21</u>\nTwo of these mutations are localized in the conserved helicase domain (exons 8-14) shared by the other RecQ helicases and are thought to destroy or disturb the DNA helicase activity of RecQL4. However, the c.2272C>T alteration could initiate a novel transcript to offset the loss of the core function, and the location of c.2752G>T on the tail end of the domain may have a minor influence on its function .\nBoth splice-site mutations impact the RQC domain, which comprises a zinc-binding domain and a winged helix domain involved in protein-protein interactions and regulation of helicase activity.12 The fact that our patients presented with an overall mild phenotype allows us to infer that their splicing variants, although much less deleterious than truncating mutations, were able to reproduce all the main cutaneous findings of RTS, likely because of the defective function of this RQC terminal region. Moreover, we also speculate that the putative residual helicase activity of the proteins encoded by the observed aberrant transcripts might have contributed to the patients’ mild phenotype.\nThis study has two limitations: First, there is a lack of experiments to verify the existence and rescue effect of non-classical transcripts. Second, the clinical phenotype of patients requires long-term follow-up visits and observation. Only a prolonged and careful follow-up of patients will allow validation of the suggested correlation between their genotype at the RECQL4 locus and their mild clinical presentation. Further studies such as functional experiments are needed to characterize the effect of these RECQL4 mutations.\nReports on mutations located outside the coding regions and associated with human diseases are rapidly growing. In this study, we reported on two Chinese girls with RTS and confirmed the presence of compound heterozygous variants. We identified three novel pathogenic RECQL4 variants related to RTS, which expanded the mutational spectrum of the RECQL4 gene and explored their pathogenic effect by transcripts analysis to address mutation-phenotype correlations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Despite scientists recognizing the symptoms of schistosomiasis earlier than the discovery of its pathogen 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>, real chemotherapy was undertaken at a much later stage.\nGlobally, the era of chemotherapy to treat schistosomiasis began when a human case with S. haematobium infection was successfully treated in 1918 with potassium antimony tartrate (PAT) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Since then, many different categories of antischistosomal drugs have been developed, and some of them, including sodium antimony subgallate (Sb-273), lucanthone, hycanthone, amoscanate, metrifonate, oxamniquine, niridazole, furapromidum, and hexachloroparaxylene have been used extensively in the treatment of schistosomiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5,6,7,8]</u>. With the exception of a few drugs, such as oxamniquine and metrifonate, most of the antischistosomals developed in the pre-praziquantel period have variable limitations with respect to safety and efficacy. More-over, oxamniquine and metrifonate are only effective against S. mansoni and S. haematobium, respectively.\nSince the discovery of praziquantel at the end of the 1970s, great progress in schistosomiasis control has been achieved worldwide. This is due to its good levels of tolerance and safety, excellent acceptability by patients, easy administration at a single-dose or very short treatment course (1-2 days), good efficacy profile against all schistosomes parasitizing humans 通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5,6,9,10,11]</u>, and low cost 通用删除6(英):<u>[5,12]</u>.\nCurrently, schistosomiasis is distributed in 78 countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. It is estimated that 779 million people live in endemic areas and about 280 million people are infected with schistosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In 2006, the strategy for schistosomiasis control proposed by the World Health Organization was to reduce disease burden, i.e. periodic treatment of at-risk populations with praziquantel (preventive chemotherapy), which aimed to cure mild symptoms and prevent infected people from developing severe, late-stage chronic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16]</u>. Even though re-infection may occur after treatment, as praziquantel is only effective against the very early stage of juvenile (three-hour old worm, day 0 schistosomula) and adult worms but has little effect against young developing stages of the parasites 通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18,19]</u>, the risk of developing severe disease is diminished and even reversed when treatment is started early in life 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\nSince the end of the 1970s until the 2000s, scientists have conducted a series of experimental studies on the effects of praziquantel against S. japonicum. These have included examining its unique pharmacological action on schistosomes, the characteristics in susceptibility of different developmental stages of schistosomes to the drug, the relationship between plasma concentration of the drug and efficacy, the impact of host factors on cidal action of the drug, prevention and early treatment of schistosomiasis, as well as praziquantel-resistant schistosomiasis. In this review, relevant data on these studies are summarized.\nPraziquantel has three unique pharmacological effects on S. japonicum and S. mansoni, i.e. stimulation of worm motor activity, spasmodic contraction of the musculature, and vesicle formation in tegument 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21,22,23,24,25]</u>. The former two actions link the subsequent hepatic shift of the worms in vivo, while the latter is key to kill the worm.\nThe minimal effective concentrations (MECs) of praziquantel required to induce increased motor activity followed by contraction of various developmental stages of S. mansoni and S. japonicum in vitro are similar, i.e. 0.005-0.1 μg/ml and 0.005-0.05 μg/ml, respectively . With these MECs of praziquantel, the increased activity of parasites occurs almost immediately and the contraction of the worm musculature typically begins after a short lag phase. At a higher concentration of 1 or 10 μg/ml, marked contraction and paralysis masks the early stimulation phase 通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u>. Praziquantel-induced stimulation of motor activity of adult S. japonicum worms is similar to the effect of serotonin (5-HT) on the worms in many aspects. However, praziquantel neither increases the endogenous 5-HT of schistosomes nor enhances uptake of exogenous 5-HT of the worm. Praziquantel likely displays 5-HT-like action or is a 5-HT receptor agonist 通用删除6(英):<u>[23,27]</u>.\nThe minimal effective concentrations (MECs) of praziquantel needed to induce an increased in motor activity, contraction of musculature or vesicle formation in different developmental stages of S. mansoni and S. japonicum\n删除重复语句：<u>The minimal effective concentrations (MECs) of praziquantel needed to induce an increased in motor activity, contraction of musculature or vesicle formation in different developmental stages of S. mansoni and S. japonicum</u>\naObserved by light microscopy\nbFew ≤ 5 vesicle per parasite, many = 5-20 vesicles per parasite, and very many ≥20 vesicles per parasite\nBased on in vitro analyses using some neurotransmitters or various compounds known to interact with the schistosome’s neuroreceptive sites and relevant blocking agents, it is suggested that the spasmodic contraction of S. mansoni and S. japonicum induced by praziquantel does not happen through neurotransmitters 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,24,28]</u>. Nevertheless, praziquantel causes a rapid rise in the tension of the musculature of male S. mansoni worms, which is related to the muscle cell membrane potential. The resting membrane potential (RMP) of a male worm’s muscle cell is - 30.7 ± 1.2 mV, but in the depolarization induced rapidly by praziquantel the RMP rises to 15.6 ± 3.1 mV. Since in the incubation medium without sodium ions (Na+), low concentration of calcium ion(Ca2+), or high concentration of magnesium ions (Mg2+), the contractile activity of worm musculature caused by praziquantel is blocked, the action of the drug on RMP of the worm’s muscle cells might be related to an increase in the tension of the parasite’s musculature 通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30]</u>.\nMicroelectrode studies have indicated that the membrane potentials of male schistosomes are derived from these sources i.e. tegument membrane, muscle masses, and the basal lamina, interstitial fibers, and extracellular space surrounding the muscle. Further studies found that the rise of tegumental membrane RMP and muscle RMP caused by praziquantel was slow. Hence, it seems that praziquantel-induced contraction of schistosomes is not dependent on changes in the membrane potential 通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32]</u>.\nAccording to in vivo studies, these two pharmacological activities are related to the hepatic shift of schistosomes induced by praziquantel 通用删除6(英):<u>[25,33]</u>. The hepatic shift of schistosomes caused by praziquantel in vivo is so fast that 5 min after S. japonicum-infected mice are orally administered with praziquantel at a single curative dose of 300 mg/kg, 94.6% of the worms have been found to shift to the liver 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. Meanwhile, other antischistosomal drugs, such as PAT, furapromidum, artemether, oxamniquine, mefloquine, and various ozonides such as OZ78, and OZ418 (synthetic 1,2,4-trioxolanes, secondary ozonides, or OZs) showed slower action in S. japonicum or S. mansoni infections with respect to hepatic shift or tegumental damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[35,36,37,38,39,40]</u>.\nVesicle formation in the tegument of Schistosoma worms is one of the earliest and most important effects of praziquantel. It is probably correlated to subsequently killing the parasites and is also consistent with susceptibilities of various developmental stages of schistosomes to the drug. It has been shown through light microscopy (LM) that the immature developmental stages (3-, 7-, and 14-day-old S. mansoni and S. japonicum worms) are particularly resistant  通用删除6(英):<u>[26,41]</u>. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been used to observe tegument of various stages of schistosomula exposed to praziquantel and revealed that a concentration of 30 μg/ml insulted the tegument of day 0 schistosomula (skin stage) where swelling, fusion, and vesicle formation were recorded. However, day 3, day 7, and day 14 juvenile worms exhibited no or only slight tegument damage. Apparent damage to the tegument of day 21 schistosomula and day 28, day 35, and day 42 adult worms was seen 15 min after exposure to the same concentration of praziquantel that resulted in severe damage to the tegument, as was revealed 4-24 h later 通用删除6(英):<u>[19,42]</u>. All three aforementioned praziquantel-induced pharmacological effects have also been described for S. mansoni worms 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>.\nExamination of day 0, day 21, day 28, day 35, and day 42 schistosomes 0.5-24 h after oral administration of praziquantel (400 mg/kg) has revealed extensive vesiculation and rupture of the tegument, while little or only mild and local vesiculation was seen in the tegument of day 3, day 7, day 11, and day 14 schistosomula. Moreover, strong host cell response was found around damaged day 0 and adult schistosomes  通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. Mean-while, after praziquantel administration, alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity and glycogen content in day 0 schistosomula has been shown to decrease significantly or even disappear, while in day 3 and day 7 schistosomula only a few showed a mild change in both AKP activity and glycogen content 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>. Four hours after administration of praziquantel using the same dose and route, observation using SEM revealed no apparent tegumental damage in day 3, day 7, and day 14 schistosomula, while slight or moderate tegument damage was detected in day 21 worms. On the contrary, severe tegument damage was observed in adult schistosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[19,42]</u>.\nPraziquantel-induced damage on tegument in different developmental stages of S. japonicum, harbouring in mice, and treated orally with the drug at a single dose of 400 mg/kg for 0.5-24 hoursa\n删除重复语句：<u>Praziquantel-induced damage on tegument in different developmental stages of S. japonicum, harbouring in mice, and treated orally with the drug at a single dose of 400 mg/kg for 0.5-24 hoursa</u>\naData from reference 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>\nb2-3 mice harbouring different developmental stages of schistosomes killed 0.5, 1, 4 and 24 hr after treatment, skins (d0), lungs (d3) or livers (d11, d14, d21, d28, d35, d42) removed for routine preparation of tissue section\ncEach value represents 40-80 sections\ndThe cells around the d21 schistosomules mainly lymphocytes\nThe results suggest that the lower efficacy of praziquantel in day 21 schistosomula might be attributed to the low level of antischistosome antibody present in the host 3 weeks after infection. Further observation of mice infected with cercariae for 21 days and treated orally with praziquantel at a higher daily dose of 500 mg/kg for 1-3 days revealed worm reduction rates of 43.8-90.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u>. Examination using SEM showed that under treatment with the higher daily dose of praziquantel for 3 days, day 21 schistosomula had severe swelling, erosion, and peeling of the tegument, accompanied by the attachment of the host leukocytes on the worm’s surface. This demonstrates that, if given at a higher daily dose for 3 days, praziquantel can directly kill day 21 schistosomula 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>.\nExamination using LM has indicated that S. japonicum at different developmental stages exposed to a praziquantel dose of 30 μg/ml for 15 min and then transferred to a drug-free medium for another 24 h results in a spasmodic contracted worm body that was elongated with normal motor activity on day 0, day 3, day 7, day 14, day 21, and day 28. In day 35 and day 42 adult worms, relaxation of contracted musculature was also seen, but numerous vesicles were still observed in the tegument. If the exposure period was extended to 4 h, day 3, day 7, day 14, and day 21 schistosomula recovered completely, while day 35, day 42, and some day 0 and day 28 worms still revealed abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. Similar results were obtained by SEM examination, except that a few day 21 schistosomula had severe tegumental injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. Stage-specific difference also occurred in S. mansoni worms 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\nPraziquantel has no apparent therapeutic effect in mice infected with day 3-day 21 S. japonicum schistosomula, but it does have an effect on day 0 schistosomula and day 28-day 42 adult schistosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[17,19]</u>. Observation using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and SEM has indicated that 5-30 min after expos- ure of adult S. japonicum worms to praziquantel in vitro or in vivo, the tegument of the worm showed extensive damage, including emergence of numerous ball-like structures or bulbs in the ridges, swelling and rupture of cytoplasmic processes, destruction of the nuclei of the syncytium, decrease in tegumental AKP, and erosion and peeling of the tegumental surface, followed by the attachment of host leukocytes to the denuded surface 通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49,50,51,52]</u>.\nIt has been demonstrated that adult schistosomes may acquire the molecules of host origin (host antigens) that incorporated into their surface, which results in the evasion of host immune reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u>. Since praziquantel is able to quickly damage the tegu- ment of schistosomes, exposure of worm surface antigen will follow. Ten to 30 min after administration of praziquantel at a dose of 300 mg/kg given to adult S. japonicum-infected mice and using the indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT), exposure of worm surface antigen extended gradually to 1/3-1/2 of the worm’s surface in 6 h. The speed, degree, and extent of antigen exposure in schistosomes coincides with the tegument alteration, as observed by SEM, and these are dose-dependent 通用删除6(英):<u>[23,50,54]</u>. Further examination using the IFAT indicated that 4 h after oral administration of praziquantel at a dose of 400 mg/kg given to mice infected with various developmental stages of S. japonicum, the percentage of exposure of worm surface antigen in day 0, day 3-day 14, day 21, day 28, and day 42 were 89.8%, 0-10%, 32.9%, 25.7%, and 41.7%, respectively; 16 h later, over 50% of the adult worms isolated from liver tissue showed exposure of worm surface antigen 通用删除6(英):<u>[19,54,55]</u>. These results suggest that the susceptibility of different developmental stages of S. japonicum to praziquantel is correlated with the expos- ure of worm surface antigen.\nIt has been shown that when adult schistosome-infected mice are treated orally with [3H]praziquantel, the radioactivity levels of the worms reach a maximum 0.5-1 h after administration, and then decline markedly 4 h later. In vitro, the uptake of [3H]praziquantel by bisexual worms has also been shown to be prompt and increase with the concentration of the drug. After these worms were transferred to a drug-free medium for 15 min, radioactivity decreased by 71-80%, indicating that [3H]praziquantel enters into the worms by a simple diffusion mechanism. This is also confirmed by determining the amount of praziquantel using high performance liquid chromatography 通用删除6(英):<u>[56,57,58]</u>.\nIn a further study, mice infected with various stages of schistosomes were treated orally with [3H]praziquantel. Thirty minutes to four hours after treatment, the amount of the silver particles detected in tissues of day 0 worms was significantly lower than the corresponding groups of schistosomes of other stages. This suggests that the susceptibility of different developmental stages of schistosomes to praziquantel is not necessarily related to the amount of praziquantel taken by the worms 通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>.\nIn vitro studies have demonstrated that spasmodic contraction of S. mansoni and S. japonicum worms depends on the existence of Ca2+, and is inhibited by high concentrations of extracellular Mg2+. The rapid contractile activity of male S. mansoni worms induced by praziquantel has been explained by the change in the permeability of the parasite to Ca2+, which results in an increased calcium influx into the worm and an induction of sustained contraction of worm musculatures. Praziquantel also stimulates the influx of Na+, but decreases the influx of potassium ion (K+) 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,24,28,29,60]</u>.\nIt has been shown that when adult S. mansoni worms maintained in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) with 45Ca2+ for 40 min were transferred to a zero Ca2+ HBSS, a biphasic efflux of 45Ca2+ from the parasites was observed, i.e. rapid decrease in the first 2 min, followed by a slower rate in the next 40 min. The amounts of total calcium in worms incubated in HBSS and calcium-free HBSS for 1 h were 3.9 ± 0.5 to 2.7 ± 0.4 mmol/kg wet weight, respectively, indicating that about 30% of a worm’s calcium is exchangeable. This exchangeable fraction may play an important role in maintaining the contractile activity of the schistosome 通用删除6(英):<u>[61,62]</u>.\nInitially, it has been suggested that vesicle formation induced by praziquantel is independent of the concentration of the external calcium, but subsequent studies have demonstrated that vesicle formation is dependent on the presence of calcium in the external medium 通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u>. Further studies have shown that when male S. japonicum worms were maintained at 37 °C in HBSS with 1.4 mmol/L of 45Ca2+ for 30 min before praziquantel was added, or both the drug and 45Ca2+ were added to the medium simultaneously, the 45Ca2+ uptake of the worms increased significantly within 1-30 min. Thereafter, accumulation of 45Ca2+ in the worms was no longer observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u>. On the other hand, if worms were exposed to praziquantel at 4 °C for 2 h, a sustained increase in 45Ca2+ content in the worms was observed, but no tegument damage or spasmodic contraction was detected. When worms maintained at 4 °C during exposure to praziquantel were transferred to 37 °C, a strong spasmodic contraction occurred and numerous vesicles appeared on the tegumental surface within 15-30 min. Thus, temperature appears to be an important factor in inducing contractile activity or the development of vesicles 通用删除6(英):<u>[64,65]</u>.\nFurther studies have shown that at 37 °C, the percentage of 45Ca2+ distributed in the tegumental cytoplasm decreased, while that in the musculature increased, but no change was detected in the total calcium content of a worm. No such phenomenon was observed at 4 °C. Thus movement of calcium between parts of the worm is what may cause praziquantel-induced contraction and tegu- mental damage, rather than an influx of calcium from the medium 通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u>.\nAlthough praziquantel clearly affects Ca2+ homeostasis in worms, the exact action mechanism is still not known. Kohn et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u> have suggested that VGCCs, e.g. heteromultimeric membrane protein complexes consisting of a pore-forming, voltage-sensing α1 subunit, may regulate intracellular Ca2+ levels and represent a possible site of action for the drug.\nThree high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel α1 subunit cDNAs were cloned from S. mansoni. One of these sequences most closely resembles the L-type class of high voltage-activated α1 subunits. The other two sequences are most closely related to non L-type α1 subunits. The other two Ca2+ channel β subunits were also cloned and expressed, one from S. mansoni and the other from S. japonicum. These two β subunits (SmCavβA and SjCavβ) have structural motifs that differ from those found in other known β subunits, and co-expression of these with a mammalian α1 subunit conferred sensitivity of the latter to praziquantel. The primary site of β subunit interaction with α1 subunits is the β interaction domain (BID). The β BIDs of SmCavβA and SjCavβ lack two conserved serines that each constitute a consensus site for protein kinase C phosphorylation, and the absence of these serines appears to render schistosome cells sensitive to praziquantel 通用删除6(英):<u>[67,68,69,70]</u>.\nAlthough several questions remain to be addressed, the hypothesis dealing with the importance of VGCCs as a possible molecular target of praziquantel against schistosomes has been proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u>. Voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCCs) mediate an extracellular Ca2+ influx in muscle fibers of S. mansoni worms and, along with Ca2+ mobilization of sarcoplasmic reticulum, contribute to muscle contraction 通用删除6(英):<u>[72]</u>. On the other hand, it is known that schistosomes cannot synthesize purine nucleosides de novo, however, in vitro praziquantel may inhibit nucleoside uptake by schistosomes but not by mammalian cells. Adenosine is known to bind to specific receptors and to behave as an indirect antagonist of calcium release in mammalian cells. If calcium channels are correlated with adenosine receptors also in schistosomes, this would support the hypothesis that praziquantel-induced calcium influx may be correlated with an adenosine receptor blockade 通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u>.\nThere are two contrasting views on whether schistosome VGCCs are involved in the mechanism of action of praziquantel. Valle et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u> have indicated that the sequences of cDNAs coding for the SmCavβ1 and SmCavβ2 subunits of different sensitive and resistant strains have been cloned and expressed, but no meaningful differences were detected. They were also unable to demonstrate major quantitative differences in the expression of the β subunits obtained from various strains and various developmental stages of S. mansoni worms 通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u>. In another report, the authors used a unique and indirect way to support this hypothesis. They developed an assay based on the transcriptional response of S. mansoni worms to heat shock to confirm that day 42 schistosomes in mice are sensitive to praziquantel, which is not the case for day 28 schistosomes. Mean-while, this sensitivity develops for day 37-day 40 schistosomes, suggesting that the differential effects of praziquantel on day 28 and day 42 worms are not based on cell exclusion as praziquantel can enter the cells of these two stages of schistosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u>. Meanwhile, a species of free-living flatworms (Dugesia japonica) was used to test the hypothesis of the action mechanism of praziquantel. The result provides the first genetic evidence implicating a molecular target crucial for in vivo praziquantel activity and supports the VOCC hypothesis of praziquantel efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>[76]</u>.\nIn order to test the hypothesis that calcium channels of schistosomes are the targets for the action of praziquantel, adult S. mansoni worms were pre-exposed to the calcium channel blockers nicardipine and nifedipine for 1 h in vitro, followed by adding a praziquantel dose of 3 μmol/L, which is supposed to kill the majority of the schistosomes, and continuous incubation overnight. The worms were then washed and transferred to a drug-free medium for observation for the following 7-10 days. About 50% of schistosomes survived the praziquantel exposure. Further pre-exposure of schistosomes to the actin depolymerizing agent, cytochalasin D, resulted in the parasites being completely refractory to the effects of very high concentrations of praziquantel of up to 36 μmol/L. Similar results were also obtained using adult S. japonicum worms. Meanwhile, examination using SEM showed that there was no or slight damage to the tegument surface and gynecophoral canal of the worms pre-exposed to cytochalasin D or nicardipine and nifedipine, which survived in the critical concentration of praziquantel. All these facts are consistent with the hypothesis that schistosome calcium channels may be in- volved in the action mechanism of praziquantel 通用删除6(英):<u>[77,78,79]</u>.\nIn a subsequent study, however, Pica-Mattoccia et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u> found that exposure of schistosomes to praziquantel after pre-incubation with cytochalasin D not only allows the complete survival of the parasites, but is accompanied by an even higher calcium uptake. Nicardipine and nifedipine also failed to prevent the calcium influx induced by praziquantel. These results place some doubt on the crucial role of Ca2+ influx in the antischistosomal activity of praziquantel and on the importance of VGCCs, speculated as the possible molecular target of praziquantel against schistosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[12,80]</u>. In recent years, nifedipine has been found to be effective against adult and juvenile S. mansoni worms in vitro, which is different from praziquantel. Hence, the authors support the idea of Ca2+ subunit as drug targets, but so far no in vivo data are available 通用删除6(英):<u>[81]</u>.\nIt is generally believed that the toxicity and efficacy of drugs are often closely related to their concentration in the host’s blood. Praziquantel is best absorbed from the duodenum and ileum, relatively well from the rectum, and much less so from the colon or stomach. When praziquantel has been injected into various segments of alimentary canal of rabbits infected with S. japonicum, the hepatic shift of schistosomes was best from duodenal administration and worst from colon and stomach injection 通用删除6(英):<u>[82]</u>.\nAdult S. japonicum worms lodge in the vessels of the portal vein system, but the relationship between blood concentration and efficacy of praziquantel is unclear . In both mice and rabbits infected with schistosomes for 4 weeks and treated orally with praziquantel at a single dose of 300 mg/kg (mice) or 40 mg/kg (rabbits), the worm reduction rates were similar; in mice the peak concentration of praziquantel in peripheral plasma was 20.2 μg/ml and in rabbits it was only 0.05 μg/ml. When praziquantel (40 mg/kg) was injected into the duodenum of rabbits infected with schistosomes for four or 8 weeks, higher praziquantel concentrations of 16-19 μg/ml were detected in the plasma of the portal vein 15 min after administration. In the subsequent 0.5-8 h, drug concentrations declined from 9 to 15 μg/ml to 0.6-1.3 μg/ml, while those in the femoral vein 5-15 min after administration were as low as 0-0.22 μg/ml and 0.13-0.56 μg/ml 通用删除6(英):<u>[83]</u>. The results demonstrate that praziquantel is extensively metabolized in the first pass through the liver. When aforementioned schistosome-infected rabbits were intramuscularly injected with praziquantel at a dose of 20 mg/kg, the efficacy was similar to when the drug was given orally at a single dose of 40 mg/kg. Interestingly, 5 min to 4 h after intramuscular administration, the plasma concentrations of praziquantel in portal vein blood and femoral vein blood were 1.2-2 μg/ml and 0.6-2.9 μg/ml, respectively, and then declined to 0.6-0.9 μg/ml 8 h later 通用删除6(英):<u>[84]</u>. It was found that in the worm pairs exposed to low concentrations of praziquantel (0.1-1 μg/ml) for 8 h and which were then transferred to a drug-free medium for continuous incubation, their motor activity recovered to normal 24 h later. If the worm pairs were exposed to praziquantel at a higher concentration of 10 μg/ml for various intervals within 24 h, the worms could not recover their normal activity, resulting in male and female worms dying 6-7 days after incubation.\nPharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of praziquantel in S. japonicum-infected mice and rabbits after oral (PO), rectal (PR) and intramuscular (IM) administration\n删除重复语句：<u>Pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of praziquantel in S. japonicum-infected mice and rabbits after oral (PO), rectal (PR) and intramuscular (IM) administration</u>\nThe same is true in in vivo studies, e.g. in bisexual schistosomes collected from S. japonicum-infected mice treated orally with praziquantel at a lower single dose of 100 mg/kg at various intervals within 72 h and incubated in a drug-free medium for 3 days, most of the worms could recover to normal activity. If bisexual worms were collected from the infected mice treated with praziquantel at a higher single oral dose of 500 mg/kg for 8-72 h, most of the bisexual worms failed to return to normal activity 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. In another study, three groups of rabbits infected with S. japonicum for 8 weeks were treated with a single dose of praziquantel by oral (40 mg/kg), rectal (40 mg/kg), or intramuscular (20 mg/kg) administration. Although the dosage of praziquantel administered intramuscularly was only half that given orally or rectally, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time course curve (AUC) of praziquantel after intramuscular administration was 5-10-fold higher than after oral or rectal administration. Nevertheless, the therapeutic effect of intramuscular administration was not greater than that achieved by rectal administration. On the other hand, the Cmax and AUC in those that were administered rectally were slightly higher than those administered orally, however, the therapeutic effects of these two groups were similar . Furthermore, after praziquantel was administered to schistosome-infected rabbits via the intraduodenal or intramuscular route, the pattern of the drug distributed in the plasma of portal vein and femoral vein was similar to those mentioned above. Meanwhile if the drug was administered rectally, the tendency of praziquantel distributed in the plasma of portal vein and femoral vein was similar to that shown in those that were administered via the intraduodenal route 通用删除6(英):<u>[84]</u>.\nAll these results indicate that no direct correlation exists between route of administration, or between levels of praziquantel in peripheral or portal venous blood, and therapeutic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>[83,84]</u>. The results confirm the importance of the time the parasite is exposed to the drug 通用删除6(英):<u>[43,85]</u>.\nIt has been known that many antischistosomal drugs, including praziquantel, are dependent on host immune status and immune effector mechanisms, particularly antibodies. Many experimental studies have been carried out in S. mansoni-infected mice immunosuppressed by T-cell deprivation or B-cell depleted mice, and the results have been fully summarized in several reviews 通用删除6(英):<u>[86,87,88,89]</u>. Here, we describe only the data dealing with the role of host immune response during exposure of S. japonicum to praziquantel either in vivo or in several immune systems in vitro.\nWhen male schistosomes were maintained in a culture medium containing immune rabbit serum (IRS) and a praziquantel concentration of 1 or 30 μg/ml, a granular flocculent material appeared on the drug-damaged surface of the worms. This flocculent material aggregated to form a membrane-like sheath around the worm that accentuated tegumental injury. If IRS was replaced by normal rabbit serum (NRS), no such phenomenon was observed. In terms of male worms exposed to a praziquantel dose of 1 μg/ml for 4 h and then transferred to a drug-free medium containing IRS, most schistosomes recovered. When male worms were exposed to praziquantel at a higher concentration of 30 μg/ml for one or 4 h before being transferred to a medium containing NRS, the damaged tegument was repaired and worm activity returned to normal in one half of the worms tested. When IRS replaced NRS, most of the worms did not recover. When male, perfused out from infected mice 1-8 h after treatment with praziquantel (single oral dose of 50 mg/kg) were transferred to a medium containing NRS or IRS and incubated for another 3 days, all or most of the damaged worms recovered to normal. In the worms obtained from infected mice treated with praziquantel at a higher dose of 400 mg/kg for 4-8 h and then transferred to a medium containing IRS, neither apparent recovery of tegumental damage nor worm activity were detected. Regarding the worms transferred to the medium containing NRS, some of the worms recovered, at different degrees 通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u>.\nFurthermore, for bisexual schistosomes maintained in a medium containing IRS or rabbit antisera to frozen-thawed tegument exudates of adult worms (ASE), glycogenactivated mouse peritoneal neutrophils and complement were exposed to a praziquantel dose of 1 μg/ml for 2-20 h, neutrophils, mediated by the aforementioned membrane-like sheath were found attached to the worm’s surface. If male and female worms were first exposed to a praziquantel concentration of 30 μg/ml for 1-4 h, then placed in the above medium without the drug, neutrophils were also observed to attach to the damaged tegumental surface of the worms. Attachment of the neutrophils appeared to accentuate tegumental damage, which resulted in worm death within 24 h. No such phenomenon was observed when the immune serum was replaced by NRS 通用删除6(英):<u>[91]</u>. Furthermore, if a Boyden chamber was used, an increase in neutrophil chemotactic activity, induced by praziquantel-damaged worms, was detected 通用删除6(英):<u>[92]</u>. Half an hour after administering a praziquantel dose of 300 mg/kg to infected mice, the tegument of schistosomes showed swelling and vacuolization at various degrees, followed by a rupture of vacuoles and formation of flocculus materials that attached to the damaged surface of the worms, similar to that seen in schistosomes maintained in the medium containing immune serum and praziquantel. Six hours after medication, numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes attached to the damaged tegument of the worms and penetrated into the worm’s body 12 h later. Meanwhile, the appearance of pathological changes of the worm tegument caused by praziquantel was seen earlier in male worms than in female worms. Nevertheless, 12-16 h after medication, female worms also had severe damage on the tegument, especially on the surface along the ovary and vitelline glands, which is similar to that observed in in vitro studies. Twenty-four hours after medication, male and female worms died 通用删除6(英):<u>[91,93]</u>. Similar results were obtained for S. mansoni-infected mice treated with praziquantel 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>.\nThese findings indicate that antibodies might play an important role in praziquantel-mediated tegumental damage. In vitro, schistosomes exposed to a praziquantel dose of 10 μg/ml might survive for 1-3 days, and the survival time of female worms is even longer than that of males. While in in vivo studies the elimination of praziquantel from the host and worms has been shown to be rapid 通用删除6(英):<u>[23,25,57,94]</u>, tegumental damage of the worms persists after praziquantel treatment, indicating that host factor could sustain praziquantel-induced damage in vivo. As a result of exposure of worm surface antigens, S. japonicum seems to be more susceptible to a host-mediated immune attack 通用删除6(英):<u>[23,54]</u>.\nVarious experimental studies have confirmed that the immune level of the host impacts the efficacy of praziquantel. For example, a single dose of 40 mg/kg administered to rabbits infected with 3-, 4-, 8-, or 10-week-old S. japonicum resulted in worm burden reductions of 14%, 46%, 84%, and 88%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[95]</u>. Further studies have shown that in rabbits infected with 50, 200, and 400 S. japonicum cercariae for four and 8 weeks, and receiving the same single oral praziquantel dose of 40 mg/kg, the worm reduction rates of the 8-week groups were 88%, 92%, and 97%, respectively. Similar results were obtained for mice infected with S. japonicum and the antibody level was shown to be positively correlated with duration and intensity of the infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[95,96]</u>.\nIn a mouse model, a single oral praziquantel dose of 400 mg/kg or 600 mg/kg has a noticeable effect on day 0 schistosomula (skin stage), but has less of an effect or is even ineffective on 6-48-h-old (skin stage) and day 3 (lung stage) schistosomula. In vitro, the same concentration of praziquantel induced similar stimulation of motor activity and spasmodic contraction in day 0, day 1 (24-h-old), and day 3 schistosomula, while the drug-induced tegument damage in day 0 schistosomula was more severe relative to that of day 1 and day 3 schistosomula. Forty-eight hours after infection, a considerable part of day 1 worms still remained in the skin, and a lower susceptibility to praziquantel revealed their intrinsic resistance to praziquantel. Observation using the IFAT showed that the percentages of exposure of surface antigen in day 0, day 1, and day 3 schistosomula were 86.4%, 55.2%, and 3.9%, respectively. It is suggested that the differences in susceptibility of these early stages of S. japonicum to praziquantel may be related to antigenic composition of their respective tegumental surfaces. Furthermore, when these three different aged schistosomula were injected into the peritoneal cavity of a mouse containing neutrophils or macrophages, the worm surface of day 0 worms rapidly attached by either kind of cells, but such phenomenon was not seen in day 1 and day 3 schistosomula. Similar results were also observed in in vitro studies, indicating differences in body surface properties at different worm ages 通用删除6(英):<u>[97,98]</u>.\nFurthermore, histological observations showed that after treatment with praziquantel, day 0 schistosomula in the host’s skin were infiltrated by inflammatory cells and some of the cells attached to or penetrated into the worm’s body; meanwhile, an increase in degranulation and collapse of the mast cells around the worms occurred. This means that host nonspecific immunity may participate in the killing mechanism during treatment, which is confirmed by the fact that praziquantel can increase the nonspecific immunity of mice after their early-stage infection with cercariae 通用删除6(英):<u>[99]</u>.\nIn the 1990s, a S. japonicum vaccine combined with praziquantel was used to enhance the killing effect against juvenile and adult schistosomes. Initially, mice were treated orally with praziquantel at a lower dose of 20 mg/kg in combination with intraperitoneal injection of class IgG1 monoclonal antibodies ISj51 or ISj55 2 h before challenge with cercariae. The same treatment regimen was repeated 4 days later. Using this combined treatment, the worm reductions were 45.3% and 43%, respectively, which were higher or significantly higher than that of each monoclonal antibody or praziquantel alone 通用删除6(英):<u>[100]</u>. Subsequently, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of monoclonal antibody, McAb14 or McAb24, combined with an oral administration of a praziquantel dose of either 20 or 50 mg/kg 2 h before infection with cercariae; this resulted in worm reductions of 45.4% and 44.2%, respectively, significantly higher than that of 13.9%, 31.5%, or 29.8% obtained for the groups of mice treated with McAb14, McAb24, or praziquantel alone.\nFurther studies have shown that in mice or rabbits treated with monoclonal antibody SSj14 combined with a low dosage of praziquantel, or SSj14 together with praziquantel and fenofibrate administered 2 h before challenge with cercariae, synergistic effects were observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[101,102]</u>. Furthermore, when mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of monoclonal antibody against schistosomula membrane 1 day before challenge with cercariae, followed by an intraperitoneal injection with a praziquantel dose of 200 mg/kg on day 3 or day 38 after infection, the worm reduction rates were 91.9% and 96.9%, significantly higher than that of 17.2% and 84.9% as obtained from the corresponding group treated with praziquantel alone. This demonstrates the synergistic effect of praziquantel combined with schistosome monoclonal antibody against juvenile and adult schistosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[103]</u>.\nIn another experiment, mice infected with S. japonicum cercariae for 2 days, 14 days, or 35 days were treated orally with praziquantel at a single dose of 150 mg/kg, followed by intravenous injection of IRS against surface membrane antigen of adult S. japonicum via tail vein 30 min after administration of the drug. The results showed that the immune serum increased the antischistosomal activity of praziquantel against day 2, day 14, and day 35 worms by 39%, 30%, and 47%, respectively. In addition, praziquantel in combination with another two monoclonal antibodies, 3B6 and IC2, also exhibited synergistic effects against adult schistosomes. All these data demonstrate that humoral immunity plays an important role in the schistosomicidal process of praziquantel 通用删除6(英):<u>[104,105]</u>.\nMeanwhile, the immunological response, such as the level of lymphocyte response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and adult worm antigen, the T-cell helper activity as well as IgM released from the antibody forming cell, in mice infected with S. japonicum increased after treatment with praziquantel. On the other hand, the immunosuppressive effects of infected hosts were improved after treatment, which suggests that besides the host immune status and antischistosome antibody, cellular immunity may also be involved and modulated in the lethal mechanism of praziquantel on the schistosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[106]</u>. It means that the death of schistosomes induced by praziquantel is closely related to the role displayed by the host.\nChemoprophylaxis can be roughly defined as protecting the definitive host from the penetration of cercariae into the skin. It is known that S. japonicum cercariae are more susceptible to praziquantel in water than in isotonic saline. The MEC of praziquantel required to kill cercariae in water is 0.05 μg/ml. Exposure of cercariae to praziquantel results in immediate contraction, followed by an increase in motor activity, release of gland contents, and separation of the tail from the body. Subsequently, the surface of the cercariae is damaged, as indicated by an increased permeability, followed by swelling of the cercarial body. Examination using TEM has shown that the glycocalyx in the outer surface of tegu- ment decreases markedly or even disappears, and hence the cercariae cannot stand the nonisotonic environment water and dies within 2-4 h 通用删除6(英):<u>[107,108,109]</u>. When cercariae were placed on the skin of mice treated orally with praziquantel 2-4 h prior, most of the cercariae were killed rapidly on the surface or keratin layer of the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>[107,110]</u>. Meanwhile, the cercariae that penetrated into the dermis or hypodermis showed severe damage and were surrounded by inflammatory cells. Further analysis demonstrated that upon administration of tritiated praziquantel to mice, there was no radioactivity in the skin in the following 2-4 h after; this supported previous findings regarding the effect of praziquantel on cercariae. Eight to 24 h after medication, the radioactivity excreted from the skin revealed no apparent effect against the parasites. Therefore, praziquantel exhibited a prophylactic effect, e.g. oral administration of praziquantel at a single dose of 400 mg/kg given to mice 2-4 h before infection with S. japonicum cercariae resulted in worm reduction rates of 88-100%. If the same oral dose of praziquantel was administered to mice 2-4 h after infection, lower worm reduction rates of 36-84% were observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[17,107]</u>. Nevertheless, when a praziquantel dose of 50 mg/kg was administered intramuscularly to dogs 4 h before and after infection, the worm reduction rates were 61% and 44%, respectively. On the other hand, when praziquantel was given at a higher oral or intramuscular dose to rabbits 4 h before or after challenge with cercariae, poor prophylactic effects were observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Hence, the window of praziquantel sensitivity for prophylaxis is very narrow, and only confined to mice. Therefore, praziquantel does not have practical significance for prevention of schistosomiasis.\nAlthough praziquantel given at a single curative dose to mice harboring day 21 schistosomula exhibits less efficacy as evaluated by the worm burden reduction, female worms show apparent shrinkage in size, depigmentation of the gut, degeneration of the vitelline glands, atrophy of the ovary, and disappearance of eggs in the uterus. Mean-while, the oviposition of female worms is inhibited significantly or even ceased during the following 2-3 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[111]</u>. Therefore, it is suggested if praziquantel is given once at appropriate intervals several times to the host starting early after infection, the majority or even all the female worms are expected to be killed just after the worms reach maturity and commence egg production. Among the regimens tested, the most promising one showed that when praziquantel was administered 21 days after infection, followed by repeated dosing at 1-3-week intervals 2-3 times, all mice were free from female worms (especially in the 3-week interval group) 通用删除6(英):<u>[111]</u>. In rabbits infected with cercariae once every week six times or once every other day five times, initial treatment with praziquantel on day 21 after the first infection at a single dose of 40 mg/kg followed by administration of the same dose at a two-week interval four or two times resulted in promising effects, with female worm reduction rates of 99-100%. Meanwhile, the presence of adult schistosomes in the same host not only increased the effect of praziquantel against day 21 schistosomula, but also had an effect on day 14 schistosomula 通用删除6(英):<u>[19,112]</u>. When rabbits were singly infected with cercariae and received the same dose of praziquantel 21 days after infection, followed by repeated dosing at 1-2-week intervals twice, similar results were observed. Meanwhile, the livers of rabbits showed normal or mild changes, and the parameters relevant to acute schistosomiasis were negative as compared to the controls 通用删除6(英):<u>[112]</u>. In rabbits infected with schistosome cercariae once every other day five times, administration of a praziquantel dose of 30 mg/kg was started 21 days after the first infection, followed by repeated dosing at a two-week interval twice. Histopathological examination showed that the reduction in the number of hepatic granulomas were 76.5-85.5%. Meanwhile, the structure of the hepatic lobules was normal 通用删除6(英):<u>[113]</u>, indicating that either the host was protected from the infection or there was a great decrease in the intensity of the infection.\nCurrently, praziquantel is the only globally available antischistosomal, and heavy reliance on a single drug for schistosomiasis control may promote the spread of drug-resistant parasites. Experiments with mice have revealed the possibility of selecting praziquantel-tolerant strains of S. mansoni after repeated administration of subcurative doses of praziquantel 通用删除6(英):<u>[114]</u>.\nA series of laboratory studies and clinical trials conducted in Egypt and Senegal between 1995 and 2002 have raised considerable concern about the possible tolerance or development of resistance to praziquantel in schistosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[115,116,117,118,119,120]</u>. Indeed, S. mansoni isolates with a somewhat reduced praziquantel susceptibility have been identified by several authors 通用删除6(英):<u>[121,122,123]</u>. However, these observations are fortunately of limited clinical significance thus far 通用删除6(英):<u>[12,124]</u>.\nIt has been speculated that antimicrobial resistance is responsible for the unusually low cure rates in S. mansoni-infected patients from Senegal 通用删除6(英):<u>[119]</u>. In Egypt, patients were not completely cured of S. mansoni infections even after praziquantel was administered three times, which is the most compelling evidence of praziquantel resistance to date 通用删除6(英):<u>[117,118,121]</u>.\nIn China, treatment of schistosomiasis japonica with praziquantel began in 1978. In the early 1990s, experimental studies indicated that in infected mice treated repeatedly with praziquantel at a curative dose, or in mice infected with 14-18-day-old schistosomula or adult worms and treated with praziquantel at various dose schedules, followed by the passage in the intermediate host snails, i.e. Oncomelania hupensis with miracidia hatching from schistosome eggs laid by the residual female worms, the F1 and F2 progeny of worms were still susceptible to praziquantel 通用删除6(英):<u>[125,126]</u>. In recent years, laboratory studies have successfully developed two isolates of S. japonicum (mainland China) resistant to praziquantel through continuous treatment with subcu- rative doses of praziquantel and a total of eight passages in O. hupensis snails. Meanwhile, not only are the sensitivities of the adult worms of the two isolates significantly lower than those of the isolates never treated with praziquantel, but cercariae and miracidia are also resistant to the drug 通用删除6(英):<u>[127,128]</u>. In order to understand and compare the sensitivities of different isolates of S. japonicum to praziquantel, S. japonicum-shedding snails from marshland and lake regions of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces were used to infect animals with various isolate(s) of cercariae released from the snails in order to determine the ED50 against adult schistosomes 5 weeks later. The results showed that the sensitivities of various isolates of S. japonicum to praziquantel are similar without significant differences 通用删除6(英):<u>[129]</u>.\nFrom the 1990s to prior to the 2010s, a series of field studies were carried out in endemic villages distributed in six provinces of China, where praziquantel had been used extensively for 10-14 years. The different prevalence rates were found for schistosomiasis: from low (3.46%) to high (8-12%). The results showed that S. japonicum is still highly susceptible to praziquantel. Meanwhile, when praziquantel was administered to patients at a single oral dose of 40 mg/kg, the efficacy of praziquantel in the area with repeated chemotherapy was not significantly different from that in the newly identified endemic foci 通用删除6(英):<u>[130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137]</u>.\nAll these results suggest that in large areas of China, after extensive and repeated use of praziquantel in the treatment of S. japonicum-infected individuals or mass chemotherapy given to persons in highly endemic areas without preliminary screening for about three decades among tens of million person-times in a huge population, no evidence of tolerance or resistance of S. japonicum to praziquantel has been found.\nInterestingly, when the area in Egypt at which resistant isolates were identified was revisited to examine the current efficacy of the drug using the same treatment protocol after 10 years of therapeutic pressure, sustained efficacy was recorded despite the presence of schistosome isolates with diminished sensitivity to the drug 通用删除6(英):<u>[138]</u>.\nIn 1918, PAT initiated the era of chemotherapy for schistosomiasis. Various categories of antischistosomal chemicals have been synthesized and developed since then. However, only a few of these have been introduced for clinical trials. After clinical practice for four decades globally, praziquantel has been confirmed as a very effective and almost the only drug of choice for the treatment of human schistosomiasis. Indeed, the discovery of praziquantel is a milestone, and extensive use of the drug has made a great contribution to schistosomiasis control worldwide.\nExperimental studies have shown that in vivo effective antischistosomal drugs, such as PAT, amoscante, oxamniquine, niridazole, furapromidum, mefloquine, and artemisinins can cause a hepatic shift and tegumental damage of schistosomes within 1-3 days post oral administration. However, only praziquantel has a similar effect against schistosomes either in vitro or in vivo at a very low concentration and a very rapid onset. Particu- larly, the damage to the tegument creates the condition and basis for the host to start the process of killing the worms. Therefore, the effects of praziquantel against schistosomes should have some reference significance for the study of new antischistosomal drugs.\nOral administration of praziquantel to S. japonicum-infected animals exhibits no apparent correlation between therapeutic efficacy and drug concentration in peripheral venous blood, but the relationship between the concentration of the drug in the blood of mesenteric vein and portal vein and therapeutic efficacy is more important 通用删除6(英):<u>[83,84]</u>. Praziquantel is absorbed mainly from the small intestine 通用删除6(英):<u>[82]</u> and thereafter schistosomes are exposed to it, lose their power to lodge in the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein, and shift back to the liver. As the drug possesses a strong first pass effect in the liver where > 90% of the drug is metabolized (supported by the low but satisfactory drug level in the peripheral circulation and high blood level in the portal vein), worms distributed in inferior mesenteric veins and its branches are insulted and quickly shift to the liver.\nThe pharmacokinetics property of furapromidum 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,139,140]</u> is similar to praziquantel. Unfortunately, the very low drug concentration in peripheral blood is not enough to drive the schistosomes distributing in inferior mesenteric veins and its branches to shift to the liver, which results in a lower cure rate obtained by treatment with furapromidum both in rabbits and humans with S. japonicum infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[140,141,142]</u>.\nThe exact action mechanism of praziquantel is still not fully known. Although scientists have made efforts to understand the action of praziquantel on the VGCCs of S. mansoni, opinions remain inconsistent. Praziquantel is less effective in T-cell deprived mice or B-cell depleted mice 通用删除6(英):<u>[86,87,88,89]</u>. Meanwhile, a very strong first pass effect of praziquantel through the liver, accompanied by a half-life of a few hours in various animals 通用删除6(英):<u>[143]</u> or 1.5 h in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>[144]</u> is unfavorable for treatment. But exposure of the worm surface antigen induced by praziquantel triggers the host action of immune effector mechanisms, which plays a synergistic role and results in the death of the worms. Hence, the action mechanism of praziquantel against schistosomes should include the target positions or molecules attacked by the drug, and immune reaction derived from the host. It is thus necessary to conduct in-depth studies on the host action of immune effector mechanisms in the process of killing schistosomes by praziquantel.\nPraziquantel was selected from over 400 1,2,3,6,7,11b-hexahydro-4H-pyrazino [2,1-α] isoquinolin-4-one and related compounds because of its outstanding anthelmintic properties 通用删除6(英):<u>[143]</u>. The chemical structure of praziquantel has been extensively modified by many scientists, but they have failed to develop a better alternative compound, which has been fully summarized in a recent review 通用删除6(英):<u>[144]</u>. So far, many categories of synthesized compounds have been reported to be effective against schistosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[7,145,146,147]</u>; a few are related to each other, while most are different types. However, the same types of compounds often exhibit very high structural specificities, i.e. modification of an effective compound always obtains the compounds with little effect over the original one. Hence, it is still necessary to design a new category of compounds for the development of new antischistosomal drugs.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Multilingual abstracts in the five official working languages of the United Nations.

Oral rehydration saline (ORS) is commonly recommended for children with VVS, but its therapeutic efficacy is unsatisfactory in a significant portion of cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u> A reasonable explanation might be that there are a variety of underlying mechanisms responsible for VVS, such as hypovolemia, abnormal autonomic nervous activity, and vasomotor dysfunction. ORS, administered to increase the body blood volume, may be beneficial for patients with hypovolemia as the main mechanism rather than for those with other underlying mechanisms.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9,10]</u> Therefore, ORS treatment for unselected patients lowers its value. To improve the therapeutic efficacy of ORS for VVS in children, it is essential to seek reasonable indicators that predict the hypovolemic condition before treatment.\nBody mass index (BMI), a typical and easily obtained anthropometric parameter, can reflect body blood volume to a certain extent, and people with lower BMI are more prone to undergo syncope and respond positively to a head-up tilt test (HUTT).通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13,14,15,16]</u> Therefore, the present study explored the capability of BMI to predict the therapeutic response of children with VVS to ORS.\nAll procedures involving human participants in the study were in line with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendment in 2008, and the present study was authorized by the Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2018112)</u>.\nThis was a retrospective case-control study. Seventy-eight patients with VVS who visited the Syncope Unit of Pediatrics at our hospital from November 2010 to June 2019 and underwent ORS treatment were included in the study; they had a median age of 10.0 (8.0, 13.0) years. Detailed histories and physical examinations were obtained routinely, and medical tests, such as blood tests, electrocardiography, Holter electrocardiography, echocar-diography, electroencephalography, and intracranial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were performed to exclude cardiogenic or neurologic diseases. VVS was finally diagnosed with the help of the HUTT according to the guidelines provided by the Chinese Pediatric Cardiology Society.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,17,18]</u> The exact diagnostic criteria which have not changed since 2009 were as follows: 1) syncopal episodes; 2) syncope commonly induced by predisposing factors, such as rapid postural changes, prolonged upright positions and hot and stuffy environments; 3) a positive hemodynamic response in the HUTT; and 4) the exclusion of other causes of syncope-like events. Patients with a history of heart failure, hypertension or renal disease, and those without complete clinical information were excluded. Patients who refused to undergo ORS treatment were also excluded.\nThe protocol for the HUTT and the positive response criteria were in accordance with those previously described.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u> Three types of positive hemodynamic responses were identified according to the changes in heart rate and blood pressure: 1) a cardioinhibitory response, with an obvious reduction in heart rate and no marked decrease in blood pressure; 2) a vasoinhibitory response, with a marked decrease in blood pressure and no obvious reduction in heart rate; and 3) a mixed inhibitory response, with both an obvious blood pressure decrease and a significant heart rate reduction.\nBMI (kg/m2) was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m). For the measurement of body weight, subjects were required to wear only one layer of clothes and gently step onto a digital weighing scale. The reading was recorded when it became stable. To measure height with the use of a stadiometer, subjects were asked to take off their hats and shoes and remain in an upright position with their backs, buttocks and heels against a pole and their eyes looking forward. An operator adjusted the slide plate to drop down slowly and gently until there was contact between the cranial vertex and the bottom of the slide plate. All operators were trained in advance. BMI prior to treatment was regarded as the baseline BMI.\nAll included VVS patients received 5.125 g of ORS III (Anjian Pharma Company, Xi’an, China) daily. It contained 3.375 g of anhydrous glucose, 0.725 g of sodium citrate, 0.650 g of sodium chloride and 0.375 g of potassium chloride which were dissolved in 250 mL of water. ORS III has been produced since 2009 in China. Three months after starting therapy, the patients were followed up to assess their response to the intervention by telephone or during clinic visits. Questionnaires were used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects. Symptom scoring was used to reflect the severity of VVS, and the scores were calculated on the basis of the occurrence and frequency of syncopal and presyncopal events: 0, no syncope or presyncope; 1, once per month; 2, 2-4 events per month; 3, 2-7 events per week; 4, > once per day. The scoring system was used to assess each patient both before treatment and 3 months after follow-up. The therapeutic efficacy was determined to be effective when the symptom score decreased by at least 1 point, and correspondingly, these patients were considered \"responders\" ; otherwise, they were considered \"non-responders\" 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u> All follow-up tasks were completed by the same professionally trained researcher.\nSPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis. Continuous variables were examined for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and they are presented as the means and standard deviations or the medians (25th, 75th percentiles) as appropriate. Differences between two groups were analyzed using Student’s t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables are shown as frequencies and were compared with the chi-squared test. Predictors of response to ORS treatment were examined by forward stepwise logistic regression analysis. Correlations between nonnormally distributed parameters were evaluated with partial Spearman correlation coefficients to avoid potential confounders. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive ability of BMI for ORS treatment in children with VVS. The predictive value was represented by the area under the curve (AUC), with a low predictive value when the area was greater than 0.5 and less than or equal to 0.7, a moderate predictive value when the area was greater than 0.7 and less than or equal to 0.9 and a high predictive value when the area was >0.9. The maximum Youden index, which was calculated as sensitivity plus specificity minus 1, was used to determine the cut-off value. It was considered significant with a P value <0.05.\nSeventy-eight patients (41 females, aged 5-17 years; and 37 males, aged 6-16 years) with VVS receiving ORS treatment were included in the study, but four of them were subsequently lost to follow-up. Finally, 74 eligible patients (38 females, aged 6-17 years; and 36 males, aged 6-16 years) were enrolled with a median treatment duration of 3.0 (2.0, 3.0) months. Of them, 48 (65%) patients had a vasoinhibitory response, 24 (32%) patients had a mixed inhibitory response and the remaining 2 (3%) patients had a cardioinhibitory response. No adverse effects were reported according to follow-up data. Based on the changes in symptom scores, 52 patients were defined as responders, and the other 22 were defined as non-responders. Between responders and non-responders, no difference was found in the symptom scores before treatment (P = 0.886). However, the responders had much lower symptom scores at follow-up than the non-responders (P < 0.001). No differences existed in sex, age at the first syncope event, age at HUTT, duration of treatment, hemodynamic characteristics in HUTT or hemodynamic types of VVS between responders and non-responders (P > 0.05). Compared with the non-responders, the responders had short duration of symptoms before treatment (P = 0.001) and low baseline BMI (P < 0.001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.\nComparisons of characteristics of responders and non-responders in 74 patients with vasovagal syncope.\n删除重复语句：<u>Comparisons of characteristics of responders and non-responders in 74 patients with vasovagal syncope.</u>\nNormally distributed data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation, otherwise as the median (25th, 75th percentiles).

HUTT: Head-up tilt test; BP: Blood pressure; VVS: Vasovagal syncope; VI: Vasoinhibitory response; MI: Mixed inhibitory response; CI: Cardioinhibitory response.\nItems with P values <0.1 in the univariate analysis (age at HUTT, duration of symptoms before treatment, baseline BMI and positive systolic blood pressure in HUTT), were included in the binary logistic regression analysis, and only the baseline BMI was determined to be an independent predictor of response to ORS treatment (odds ratio = 0.629, 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 0.500-0.792, P < 0.001).\nTo further explore whether the baseline BMI was associated with the severity of VVS, we performed a partial Spearman correlation test after adjusting for sex and found that the baseline BMI was positively correlated with response time in HUTT (r = 0.256, 95% CI: 0.067-0.439, P = 0.029) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nTo explore whether baseline BMI could predict the therapeutic efficacy of ORS, we applied ROC curve analysis. The area under the curve was 0.818 with a 95% CI of 0.704 to 0.932 (P < 0.001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>. A baseline BMI of 18.9 kg/m2 was determined to be the cut-off value for the maximum Youden index, with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 73%.\nIn this study, we observed that the baseline BMI of responders was much lower than that of non-responders. The baseline BMI showed a positive correlation with the response time in the HUTT. More importantly, a baseline BMI cut-off value of 18.9 kg/m2 produced a relatively high value in predicting the response of children with VVS to ORS treatment.\nAlthough the administration of ORS is relatively safe, we do not advise pediatricians to prescribe it nonselectively. Inappropriate ORS treatment would greatly limit its therapeutic efficacy, prolong the duration of symptoms, and increase the economic burden of the families. Therefore, it has been important to determine a useful measure for predicting the therapeutic efficacy of supplementation with fluid and salt in pediatric VVS and to identify a more individualized treatment.\nORS is effective for VVS patients likely through the restoration of hypovolemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> After standing, an instantaneous shift of blood from the thorax to the lower extremities and splanchnic organs occurs. Decreased venous return to the heart is overt once the total blood volume is low, which leads to the decompensation reaction. Obviously, supplementing with fluid and salt can reverse the situation in patients whose predominant mechanism is hypovolemia. Disappointingly, heterogeneous and overlapping multifactorial mechanisms greatly reduce the value of this treatment. Blood volume can be calculated using isotopic or dye dilution techniques. However, the procedures for these techniques are complex and invasive.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Two decades ago, Younoszai et al通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> investigated the value of an intravenous injection of 1 L of isotonic fluid during tilting to predict the efficacy of oral fluid therapy. A negative response to the tilt table test after intravenous injection predicted good efficacy of oral fluid therapy, with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 20%. However, this method is invasive, time-consuming, and has the risk of inducing heart failure. Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium was reported to be correlated with blood volume and the severity of VVS.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u> Recently, Zhang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> observed that 109.5 mmol of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion had a sensitivity of 100% to predict the therapeutic efficacy of ORS, but its specificity was low (30.8%). Further study is required to determine its predictive value.\nPrevious studies have shown that BMI is positively related to blood volume通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13]</u> and can predict the therapeutic efficacy of ORS in children diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, another common cause of pediatric syncope.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Furthermore, people with lower BMI are more prone to experience syncope or respond positively to a HUTT than those with higher values.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16]</u> Therefore, we conducted the present study to evaluate whether baseline BMI had the capacity to predict the therapeutic efficacy of ORS treatment.\nIn the present study, we found that the baseline BMI of the responders was much lower than that of the non-responders. Furthermore, we used response time in HUTT as a reasonable indicator of the severity of VVS,通用删除6(英):<u>[27,28]</u> and it showed a positive correlation with baseline BMI, which suggested that baseline BMI was reasonably capable of reflecting the severity of this disease. With the help of ROC curve analysis, we found out for the first time, that baseline BMI was a promising predictor prior to treatment.\nHowever, body blood volume is influenced by many cofactors aside from weight and height (which were used in calculating BMI), such as age, physical activity, climatic environment, hematocrit and autonomic nervous activity. All these cofactors codetermine the actual state of blood volume.通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30,31,32,33]</u> Therefore, the value of application of BMI in predicting the efficacy of supplementation with fluid and salt could be lowered by such cofactors.\nSome limitations should not be neglected in this study. The small sample size could have led to bias in the study conclusions. Additionally, the retrospective case-control study design could have resulted in an inevitable recall bias. In the future, prospective and larger sample multicenter studies seeking better indicators are needed for the implementation of individualized therapy in VVS patients.\nBaseline BMI is a promising and practical way to predict the therapeutic response of children with VVS to ORS treatment, not only for its predictive capacity but also for its ease of measurement and inexpensiveness.

All animals were handled in strict accordance with the protocols formulated by the Animal Welfare and Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.\nNeonatal mice were injected intraperitoneally with either phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or 10 mg LPS (Escherichia coli 055: B5, Sigma-Aldrich, USA).通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> Mice were sacrificed at different time points (6 h, 12 h, and 24 h) after LPS injection and their tissues were subjected to further processing as described below. The blood samples were harvested by cardiac puncture.\nFor the morphologic study, 5-μm sections of paraffin-embedded thymi were hematoxylin-eosin stained, and sections were observed under a microscope equipped with a Spot Insight QE camera (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).\nFrozen thymic sections were stained with rabbit anti-mouse keratin (K) 5 and rat anti-mouse K8 monoclonal antibody (Covance Research Products, USA), and then with Alexa Fluor-488-, and 546-conjugated goat anti-rat immunoglobulin G (IgG), and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, USA). The sections were then observed under a Nikon A1R Spectral Confocal Microscope (Nikon, Kanagawa, Japan).\nThe thymi were incubated at 37°C in 0.01 (w/v) liberase (Roche, USA) and 0.02% (w/v) DNase I (Roche, USA) with gentle agitation as previously described.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> The supernatant fractions were collected into a fresh tube placed on ice and containing PBS buffer with 0.02% (v/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma, USA) and 5 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to terminate the digestion. The thymic fragments were incubated in a fresh enzyme mix, and the incubation/digestion cycle was repeated 3 times. Cells were washed with and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, USA).\nSingle-cell suspensions of thymocytes and TECs cells were stained with one or more of the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: Allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD4, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD8, PerCP/Cy5.5-conjugated anti-epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM) 1, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, PE-conjugated anti-ulex europeus lectin (UEA) and APC-conjugated anti-CD45.1 (BioLegend, BD Biosciences, USA). The samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton and Dickinson, USA). Data analysis was conducted using FlowJo software package (TreeStar, Inc. Ashland, USA).\nVEGF levels (R and D Systems, MN, USA) in the serum and the TECs were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, and the ELISA was performed by following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nProteins were extracted from TECs by using the NE-PER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Scientific, USA). Equal amount of proteins was loaded onto a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filter (PVDF) membranes, and then incubated with antibodies. The membranes were developed with SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, USA). In brief, samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 7 min at 80°C, loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE, subjected to electrophoresis for 60 min, and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. To reduce nonspecific binding, the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies in PBS-Tween buffer, washed 3 times with PBS-Tween buffer, and then incubated with a suitable secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature. The following antibodies were used: β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology Inc. USA), rabbit anti-human VEGF, antibody against phospho-p38 (p-p38) and total p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. USA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.\nAll experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Data were presented as a mean ± standard error (SE). Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey honest significant difference test for multiple comparisons. The differences were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05.\nThe chest was opened to harvest neonatal thymus after LPS challenge. Twenty-four hour after the treatment, thymus size was found to be significantly smaller in LPS-exposed mice than in shame-treated mice (only PBS was given). Compared with shame-treated mice, the thymus of LPS-treated mice looked paler 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u>. The number of thymocytes and TECs was significantly decreased at 24 h post-LPS challenge, (2.40 ± 0.46)×107 vs. (3.93 ± 0.66)×107 and (1.16 ± 0.14)×105 vs. (2.20 ± 0.19)×105, P < 0.05, respectively 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b and Figure 1c]</u>. Normal neonatal thymus predominantly consisted of the cortex, with a very small medullary area. The neonatal murine thymus showed congestion and the medullary area of the thymus in LPS-treated mice began to shrink 24 h after exposure to LPS 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1d]</u>.\nFACS analysis showed that the thymocyte subsets include CD4 and CD8 double-negative (CD4−CD8− DN) cells, double-positive (CD4+CD8+ DP) cells, and CD4+ CD8− or CD4−CD8+ single-positive (CD4+ CD8− SP or CD4−CD8+ SP) cells. The immature SP cells represent the transitional state between the CD4−CD8− DN and CD4+CD8+ DP cells. TECs can be broadly divided into cortical TECs (cTECs, CD45−EpCAM1+MHCII+UEA−) and medullary TECs (mTECs, CD45−EpCAM1+MHCII+UEA+). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the TECs subsets contained K5−K8+ cortical epithelial cells (green-stained), or cTECs, and K5+K8− medullary epithelial cells (red-stained), or mTECs. Thymocytes subset distribution pattern was significantly altered 24 h after LPS treatment. The late-stage cells of thymopoiesis (DP cells) exhibited a dramatically decreased proportion 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2a and Figure 2b]</u>. The total number of thymocytes was decreased since the populations of both DN immature T-cell precursors and DP cells were reduced. Although the proportion of SP was changed, the change was not statistically significant. The proportion of TECs subsets also underwent alternation 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2c and Figure 2d]</u>. Specifically, the number of cTECs and mTECs in the LPS-treated mice were decreased 1.5-fold and 3.9-fold, P < 0.05, respectively, lower than in their controls 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2f]</u>. The number of K5+K8+ cells (yellow-stained), representing thymic epithelial progenitors (TEPs), was also decreased 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2e]</u>.\nSerum VEGF level was elevated at 6 h and 12 h after LPS administration in the sepsis mice model, but was decreased in 24 h 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3a]</u>. Local VEGF productions varied with different in tissues after LPS stimulated. In the neonatal thymus, VEGF is locally produced by TECs and few immature thymocyte subsets.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> After LPS challenge, VEGF expression in TECs was down-regulated in a time-dependent manner 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3b and Figure 3c]</u>. Moreover, our study showed that TECs numbers and VEGF level was decreased simultaneously.\nTECs were isolated from the thymi of neonatal mice after they were exposed to LPS for 24 h. Western blotting showed that exposure to LPS for 24 h decreased the protein expression of p-p38 in TECs after the LPS treatment as compared with that of the shame-treated mice 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>.\nLPS induces acute involution of the adult and fetal thymus通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,17,18]</u> and, as a consequence impairs immune functions. It is of great importance to understand, in general, the alternation of the neonatal thymus in sepsis, and in specific, differences in cell subsets between the neonatal and adult thymusin the event.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> In this study, we demonstrated that the specific loss of DP thymocytes and TECs in sepsis substantially reduced the output of naive T-cells and the VEGF expression in TECs was down-regulated in a time-dependent fashion.\nT-cell development, which is critical for neonatal immune responses, takes place primarily in the thymus, and is fundamentally dependent on the thymic microenvironment. TECs are the principal source of immune-regulatory molecules and perform a number of irreplaceable functions that are essential for thymocyte growth and maturation. Our data demonstrated that not only thymocytes but also TECs contribute to thymus involution in the neonatal sepsis. Moreover, we showed that the number of TEPs was also decreased during the thymus involution, suggesting that both mature TECs and immature TECs, including TEPs, are responsible for thymus involution. After endotoxin challenge, both systemic and intrathymic pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade are activated. As a result, the thymic cellularity was diminished and thymocyte distribution profile was changed.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Moreover, our study also showed that LPS exerted a strong impact on the immature thymocytes and mTECs in our neonatal sepsis model, which was found to have a higher proportion of immature thymocytes.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Furthermore, the neonatal TEC dominance was rapidly changed to an adult pattern, which is characterized by, among others, alternation from cTEC dominance to mTEC dominance.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nRecent studies demonstrated that plasma VEGF levels were increased during severe sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20,21,22,23]</u> However, with the condition progressing to septic shock, the VEGF levels dropped, and the reduced VEGF levels were found to be associated with poor outcome.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,21]</u> Our data, consistent with these findings, showed that the plasma VEGF levels were increased in the first 12 h, and then quickly went down in neonatal sepsis. A previous study showed that the prolonged (>21 days) and high-dose (>100 ng/ml) systemic administration of VEGF in adult cancer mice could block thymocyte precursors from leaving the bone marrow and traveling to the thymus, resulting in thymic atrophy.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> However, our study found that the level of systemic VEGF was transiently increased and lower than 100 ng/ml. Thus, it is most likely that serum VEGF did not work on TECs in at the early stage of sepsis. VEGF expression is organ-specific during sepsis, and it was significantly elevated in the heart通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> and hepatic tissues,通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> but was decreased in the lung通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> and the renal tissue.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> Different from adult thymus, VEGF message was found to be highest in neonatal TECs, but whether local VEGF expression had an effect on thymus atrophy in neonatal sepsis remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that local VEGF of the thymus was decreased time-dependently because TECs number was reduced. Moreover, we found that DN immature T-cell precursors and DP cells were reduced with the disease progression. Of note, there were some critical differences in thymocytes between neonatal and adult thymus in terms of stages of thymic development and the expressions of local VEGF and VEGF-receptor 2, both being found to have significantly higher expression in neonatal TECs than in adult thymus.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> It is possible that, at the early phase of thymic development, the thymus tends to be specifically affected by elevated local VEGF. According to a previous study, VEGF rapidly decreased the number of the earliest observable progenitors in the thymus.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> The local production of VEGF supports and/or maintains thymic endothelia, which, in turn, influence thymopoiesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nThe expression pattern of local VEGF in the signal pathway of neonatal thymus had not been well-understood. As we know it, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling is a quite unique proliferation-initiating process. The p38 was found to play a critical role in the regulation of VEGF production in neonatal stem cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> LPS-induced VEGF production depends on the p38 activation in macrophages.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Our study showed that the p-p38 was blocked in the thymus of LPS-challenged mice, suggesting that TECs respond directly to LPS and p-p38 inactivation is involved in the further differentiation of thymocytes from immature to maturity.通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u> The p-p38 was present in the entire Hassall’s corpuscles,通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> VEGF is significantly highly expressed in neonatal TECs.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Hence, we are led to speculate that, unlike in adult thymus, elevated VEGF, might be due to the difference in p-p38 signaling pathway in the neonatal thymus.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> In this study, we only demonstrated that specific roles of p38 signaling pathway in the thymic involution after bacterial infection. Nonetheless, it remains unclear which of these processes is the initial event and whether other signal pathways are involved.\nIn conclusion, we, by establishing a model of clinical sepsis, showed that VEGF in thymic cells subsets might contribute to the development of TECs in neonatal sepsis. Further investigation is warranted to explore the strategies of promoting the functional recovery of thymus by elevating VEGF levels.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Direct measurement of portal venous pressure is extremely invasive and is associated with high patient risk. In addition, changes in intra-abdominal pressure can affect portal pressure, which can lead to unreliable results.2 Therefore, direct measurement of portal venous pressure is not recommended in patients with cirrhosis.\nHepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), defined as the difference between wedged and free hepatic venous pressure, is an accurate reflection of portal venous pressure and is therefore regarded as the standard method for evaluating portal hypertension.3,4 This procedure, however, is not that widely performed in clinical practice,5 due largely to its invasiveness, high cost, and the requirement for operator expertise.删除4：<u>5,6,7</u>\nTolerance and acceptance of medical techniques have been considered important factors for their promotion and application.8,9,10,11,12 A single-center study evaluating parameters related to the tolerance (i.e. pain and duration) of hepatic hemodynamic procedures (i.e. HVPG measurement ± transjugular liver biopsy [TLB] ± Swan-Ganz catheterization) in patients with (62.1%) and without (37.9%) cirrhosis showed that tolerance to these hepatic hemodynamic procedures was good.13 To our knowledge, however, no international multicenter study has evaluated the tolerance of HVPG measurement in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, although acceptance of a medical procedure, such as liver transplantation or COVID-19 vaccination, is considered important for its promotion and application, no study to date has evaluated the acceptance of HVPG measurement by patients with cirrhosis.8,9,14,15 The present study was therefore designed to also assess the tolerance and acceptance of HVPG measurements in patients with cirrhosis.\nThis study was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Lanzhou University. All patients who participated in this study provided written informed consent.\nThis prospective international multicenter observational cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04121520) enrolled patients with cirrhosis who were scheduled to undergo HVPG measurement at 20 institutions, including 17 in China and 1 each in Turkey, Japan, and Brazil, between October 2019 and June 2020.\nPatients were included if they 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> were aged 18-75 years with no restriction on gender; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> had been clinically and/or pathologically diagnosed with sinusoidal cirrhosis; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> provided written informed consent; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> were scheduled to undergo HVPG measurement. Patients were excluded if they 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> had contraindications for HVPG measurement; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> were pregnant or lactating women; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> had severe coagulopathy (i.e. international normalized ratio >5); or 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> had severe heart, lung, or kidney disease.\nThe indications for HVPG measurement included: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> assessment of the efficacy of primary and secondary prophylactic drugs for gastroesophageal variceal bleeding; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> prediction of the risk of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding and determination of treatment regimens; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> prediction of the risks, progression, and clinical outcomes of decompensation events in cirrhosis; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> evaluation of the efficacy of new drugs; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> evaluation of the accuracy of new noninvasive techniques; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> diagnosis and differential diagnosis of types of portal hypertension. HVPG was measured as described.删除4：<u>16,17</u>\nTolerance and acceptance of HVPG measurements were determined using descriptive questionnaires prepared based on discussions among the investigators. The questionnaires were subsequently evaluated by an expert panel consisting of three professionals with expertise in hepatology and three professionals with expertise in interventional radiology before the approval of these questionnaires for use in this study.18,19 Tolerance of HVPG measurement was evaluated by determining the severity of preoperative anxiety; intraoperative and postoperative pain scores were rated on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain); and discomfort level was rated as none, mild, moderate, severe, or intolerable during and after the HVPG procedure. The preoperative expected pain score was also determined after the procedure. In addition, to determine the uncomfortable step during the HVPG measurement procedure, the latter was divided into four steps (i.e. local anesthesia, paracentesis, catheterization, and measurement of HVPG), and the patients were asked to choose the most uncomfortable step during the HVPG measurement. Acceptance of the HVPG measurement procedure was assessed using questions pertaining to four aspects: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> understanding the value of HVPG measurements; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> determining whether HVPG measurements were helpful; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> determining whether the patient would choose to measure HVPG again; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> assessing whether the cost of HVPG measurement was acceptable.\nBaseline characteristics, including age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis, Child-Pugh class, complications of cirrhosis, and preoperative treatment, were recorded. Parameters related to the HVPG measurement procedure were recorded during (i.e. value of HVPG, duration of HVPG measurement, venous access, and procedures) and after (i.e. procedure-related complications) HVPG measurements. The value of HVPG in each patient was calculated as the mean value of HVPG measurements in that patient. The duration of HVPG measurement was defined as the time interval between administration of local anesthetic and removal of the catheter from the hepatic vein immediately after HVPG measurement. Data assessing the tolerance and acceptance of HVPG measurement were collected within 24 h after the procedure. Complications were defined as a secondary disease or condition that developed after the HVPG measurement and required additional care, prolonged hospitalization, or therapy.20,21 Complications experienced within 24 h of the start of HVPG measurement were also recorded.\nContinuous variables were compared using Student's t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests, as appropriate, and categorical variables were compared using χ2 or Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate. Pairwise comparisons between groups were performed by the one-way analysis of variance using the Bonferroni post hoc tests. Two-sided p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software for Windows .\nThis study included 271 patients, 166 (61.6%) men and 105 (39.4%) women, with a mean age of 55.3 ± 11.9 years. The characteristics of these patients were shown in Table 1. Hepatitis B virus infection (55.4%) was the most common etiology of cirrhosis, followed by alcohol (12.2%), autoimmune hepatitis (11.8%), hepatitis C virus infection (4.1%), primary biliary cirrhosis (2.2%), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (5.8%). The most common complication of cirrhosis was variceal hemorrhage (62.4%), followed by ascites (40.6%), hypersplenism (39.5%), and hepatic encephalopathy (6.3%). In addition, 7% of these patients were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. Evaluation of liver function classified 137 (57.8%), 94 (39.7%), and 40 (16.9%) patients as Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C, respectively. Of these patients, 78.6% had been treated before HVPG measurement, including with nonselective beta-blockers (41.7%), endoscopic ligation or sclerotherapy (31.4%), splenectomy (5.5%), partial splenic embolization (PSE, 4.8%), and conservative treatment (3.0%), such as percutaneous peritoneal drainage or administration of ursodeoxycholic acid. After HPVG measurement, 112 (41.3%) patients were treated with the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or PSE, 56 (20.7%) with nonselective beta-blockers, 48 (17.7%) with endoscopic ligation or sclerotherapy, 45 (16.6%) with conservative treatment, and 10 (3.7%) with splenectomy.\nBaseline characteristics of patients with cirrhosis who were scheduled to undergo HVPG measurement (n = 271).\n删除重复语句：<u>Baseline characteristics of patients with cirrhosis who were scheduled to undergo HVPG measurement (n = 271).</u>\nNote: Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or as n (%).\nAbbreviations: HVPG, hepatic venous pressure gradient; PSE, partial splenic embolization.\naOther etiologies included schistosomiasis, drug-induced liver injury, and cryptogenic cirrhosis.\nHVPG measurement was technically successful in all patients.

The duration of HVPG measurement was <30 min in 90.4% of patients. HVPG was measured through the jugular vein in 263 patients (97.0%), through the femoral vein in 5 (1.8%), and through the median antebrachial vein in 3 (1.1%). Fever (38.8°C/101.8°F) was observed in one patient 28 h after HVPG measurement, with these symptoms resolved within 3 days after taking cefoperazone.

Mean preoperative expected pain scores (2.7 ± 2.1), intraoperative pain scores (2.2 ± 2.3), and postoperative pain scores (1.5 ± 1.8) all differed significantly from each other (p < 0.001). The postoperative pain score was significantly lower than the preoperative expected pain score (p < 0.001) and intraoperative pain score (p < 0.001), and the intraoperative pain score was significantly lower than the preoperative expected pain score (p = 0.036). During the HVPG measurement, three patients rated discomfort as intolerable, with two experiencing maximum discomfort during insertion of the catheter and one during the HVPG measurement. No, mild, moderate, and severe discomfort were reported by 36.9%, 44.6%, 11.1%, and 6.3% of patients, respectively, during HVPG measurement and by 54.6%, 32.5%, 11.4%, and 1.5%, respectively, after HVPG measurement.

Most patients (60.8%) reported that HVPG measurement was quite helpful, whereas 35.1% and 4.1% regarded HVPG measurement as being of little or no help, respectively. Although small numbers of patients reported being unlikely (4.4%) and definitely unwilling (3.3%) to measure HVPG again, larger numbers of patients would definitely (15.5%), probably (46.9%), and possibly (29.9%) choose to undergo additional HVPG measurements.

In addition, pain scores during (2.2 ± 2.3) and after (1.5 ± 1.8) the procedure were significantly lower than expected pain scores (2.7 ± 2.1) before the procedure, suggesting that the level of pain experienced by patients was not as high as they expected and that these patients tolerated pain arising from the procedure. In addition, only three patients (1.1%) reported an intolerable level of discomfort. Taken together, these findings show that tolerance of HVPG measurement was high in the current study, consistent with previous results.13 In Casu et al.13 tolerance of hepatic hemodynamic procedures was calculated by combining the average duration of pain and pain scores, both determined on visual analog scales. These scales and methods of calculation were not used in the current study because these self-determined scales were regarded as too inaccurate for determining tolerance to HVPG measurements. Rather, tolerance in this study was measured using questionnaires addressing preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative evaluations of pain and discomfort associated with HVPG measurements.\nA high level of acceptance is crucial for adopting a medical technique. One example is the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination, as the number of persons vaccinated correlated with the risk of infection in the general population.14 To date, however, factors affecting the acceptance of HVPG measurement had not been investigated. The current study found that about half the patients surveyed understood little or nothing about HVPG measurement, almost 40% regarded HVPG measurement as being of little or no value, and 37% regarded the cost of HVPG measurement as relatively high or unaffordable. These findings could explain why only 62% of patients would choose to undergo repeat HVPG measurement. Thus, the acceptance of HVPG measurement was not as high as expected.\nOne reason for the low acceptance of HVPG measurement may be the unsuitable physician-patient relationship in this clinical scenario. In the parental model (or relationship), characterized by insufficient interactions and communications between physicians and patients, patients are usually provided the \"best\" diagnostic or treatment option based on the physician's knowledge and experience.23,24,25 Although all the patients with cirrhosis in the current study underwent HVPG measurement, half of these patients did not fully understand the value of this procedure, suggesting that communications between physicians and patients were insufficient and that the autonomy of patients was not fully respected. This lack of communication may have impaired the acceptance of medical interventions provided by physicians. Therefore, the performance of HVPG measurements in patients with cirrhosis requires physicians and interventional radiologists to pay more attention to their patient education and communication skills, listen to these patients, and help them understand the value of HVPG measurements. Patients should then be allowed to choose the best option for themselves.\nThis study had several limitations. First, the questionnaires used in this study have not been externally validated. The questionnaires were designed based on the clinical experience of physicians and interventional radiologists. To our knowledge, no widely used questionnaire has been proposed to quantitatively or directly assess the tolerance and acceptance of HVPG measurement. Second, 48% of patients underwent other interventional radiological procedures after HVPG measurement, including TLB, TIPS, and/or PSE, which may have affected the evaluation of some parameters.\nIn conclusion, HVPG measurement was safe and well-tolerated in patients with cirrhosis. However, more in-depth patient education and physician-patient communications are warranted to improve the acceptance of this procedure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Here, we present a sporadic case with bilateral calcified deposits in brain demonstrated with progressive gait disturbance, dementia, slurred speech, and oculomotor abnormalities.\nA 48-year-old female showed recent memory decline for 5 years, dysarthria for 3 years and progressive gait disturbance with freezing and unbalance for 6 months. She presented a slurred speech, had hesitation when initiating gait and could not walk without assistance. She felt walking like glued to the floor, but she could step across the barrier in front of her feet. General neurological examination showed difficulty in calculating, recent memory disturbance, hypophonia, and slurred speech. She showed difficulty to generate vertical upward and downward saccades and slow horizontal saccades.\nShe presented severe bilateral bradykinesia and moderate muscular rigidity, active deep-tendon reflexes, gait disturbance with freezing, and forward-bent posture with the absence of arm swings. Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-III motor scores are 43 before and 37 after acute levodopa challenge test, respectively. Hoehn and Yahr stage is 4/5. General cognition was lower (MMSE22/30). Her serum calcium, thyroid function, parathyroid hormonal assay, liver function, and kidney function were within normal limits. Her pseudohypoparathyroidism gene test showed no mutations. She was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus 13 years ago, with positive antinuclear antibody titer (1:320) while anti-double stranded DNA (6.7 U/ml) most recently. In addition, she did not show signs of a headache, seizures, arthritis, vasculitis, or mental disturbance, which did not support the diagnosis of cerebral lupus. Brain computed tomography revealed symmetrical areas of calcification in bilateral basal ganglia, thalamus, centrum semiovale, midbrain, and cerebellum 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a-1d]</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the calcified deposit in the midbrain. SLC20A2 gene mutation was screened, but there was no mutation found in this patient. Considering that this patient mainly suffered from the extrapyramidal symptom, she was prescribed levodopa 450 mg/d and selegiline 10 mg/d. Symptoms were slightly improved under medication in the 1st week but became worse after then.\nThis case exhibited extensive bilateral calcification in the brain, and showed progressive movement disorders such as clumsiness, fatigability, unsteady gait, and speech impairment. Considering the onset age and the absence of metabolic diseases, we initially diagnosed her with IBGC (Fahr’s disease).\nIn our case, vertical supranuclear palsy, prominent postural instability, symmetric rigidity, dementia, and early dysathria are the main characteristics of PSP. All the direct evidence, including the onset age at 48 years, gradually progressive disorder, poor response of parkinsonism to levodopa, supported the diagnosis of PSP. However, we found that calcified deposit existed in her midbrain 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1e and 1f]</u>, which was mentioned in the exclusion criteria (one of the mandatory exclusion terms in the NINDS-SPSP criteria of the diagnosis of PSP). Therefore, we ruled out the diagnosis of PSP in this case according to NINDS-SPSP demonstrated, though she presented a PSP-like clinical feature.\nIBGC associated with the oculomotor disorder is rare. Kim et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> presented a 77-year-old man, diagnosed as idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, suffering from PSP-like phenotype with bilateral calcification in the brain. The patient was not diagnosed PSP due to the absence of atrophy of midbrain tegmentum, superior colliculi, and pons. They assumed that oculomotor disturbance might be one of the symptoms in IBGC.\nUnlike the cases reported by other researchers, which mainly presented as the oculomotor abnormality and frequent falling, our patient exhibited severe freezing of gait. Williams et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> reported that pure akinesia with gait freezing may be associated with PSP-tau pathology and suggested that it might be the third clinical phenotype of PSP. We hypothesize that the freezing of gait and PSP-like features in our patient may be attributed to the calcification in the midbrain.\nMutations in SLC20A2, PDGFRB, XPR1, and PDGFB have been reported to cause primary familial brain calcification (PFBC). For patients that are considered the diagnosis of PFBC, other causes of brain calcification, such as disorders of calcium metabolism and heavy metal intoxication, should be eliminated before pursuing genetic testing, particularly in simplex cases. If no other primary cause for brain calcification is found or if the family history is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance, molecular genetic testing should be considered. Sequencing of SLC20A2 should be conducted first. It accounts for approximately 40% of all PFBC gene mutations including some Chinese families.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> The other three gene mutations are rare and have not been found in the Chinese population. Hence, we tested SLC20A2 mutation. However, there is no gene mutation in this patient.\nIn conclusion, the patient in our case showed prominent movement disorders and oculomotor disturbance with bilateral calcification deposits in the brain, suggesting that IBGC can cause supranuclear vertical and horizontal ophthalmoplegia. It is possible that the calcified deposit in midbrain may be associated with the oculomotor disturbance. Since several cases had been reported to have striopallidodentate calcification with vertical ophthalmoplegia, we suggest that it is necessary to carefully examine the eye movement in patients who are diagnosed with striatopallidodentate calcification.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by grants from National Key Clinical Specialist Construction Programs of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81371401 and 81501112)</u>, Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2013B021800199)</u>, Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2015A030313536)</u>, and Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2014J4100083 and 2013J4100068)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Because of repeated convulsions and progressive neuronal damage, patients often suffer from mental decline and neurological impairment.\nA 12-year-old girl presented to the hospital with a paroxysmal left limb twitching and exacerbation of left limb weakness. She was apparently well until October 2004 when she had the first episode. Later on, she gradually developed paroxysmal involuntary tremors in the left lower extremity, a few seconds each time, 2 to 3 times per day. She has consciousness, no headache, nausea, vomiting, binocular gaze, fatigue, and so on. In December 2004, the patient suddenly lost consciousness during the class and fell to the ground with limb tetanic convulsions, binocular gaze, no incontinence, and bite of tongue. After 3 min, the symptoms of seizures disappeared. Since then, the girl also developed recurrent seizures. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cranial and spinal cord was normal 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slow waves on the top of the right occipital lobe. She was diagnosed as viral encephalitis and secondary epilepsy. After treatment, the frequency of the above attacks was dramatically reduced, and the amplitude of limb shaking was decreased. However, the frequency of seizures suddenly increased in September 2005, with more than ten attacks per day. The girl had disturbance of consciousness, incontinence, headache, vomiting, and weakness in the left limb.\nThe girl was born in Guiyang, Guizhou Province. The patient went on vocation in February 2004 before episode. There is no history of hepatitis and tuberculosis vaccination, and no pets in the family.\nThe score was 30 points on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scale. Limb muscle strength is level 5 and muscle tension is normal. The tendon reflex of left upper and lower limb (++ + + ), it includes the radial nerve of the brachioradialis muscle, biceps musculocutaneous nerve, triceps radial nerve, and quadriceps (patellar) femoral nerve. Left patellar clonus and ankle clonus (+). The tendon reflex of right upper and lower limb (+ +), Babinski sign 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>, Pussep sign (+) on the left. Kernig sign 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> in October 2004.\nWhen the girl was presented to hospital for the second time, a review of the cranial MRI revealed the cortex and subcortical irregular lamellae on the right parietal occipital lobe were slightly longer T1, longer T2 signals, the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) phase was high, the boundaries were clear, and the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging were not diffuse. Restricted, the lesion near the sulcus narrowed slightly, and abnormal signals increased, and no abnormalities in conventional, biochemical, or TOACH results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The number of seizures was reduced after treatment, but the weakness of the left limb was not improved. The right parietal occipital lobe of the cranial MRI was enlarged compared to previous one. Her rehabilitation included learning, writing, using a computer, and walking every day.\nThere were no abnormalities in blood routine, routine urine, blood biochemistry, and coagulation. Hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, and hepatitis C antibodies were negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum ammonia, and anti-streptococcus hemolysin O antibody are normal. Thyroid function, copper and serum copper levels and serum ceruloplasmin were normal. The chest radiograph was normal. Lumbar puncture 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005-9-12)</u>: CSF pressure 150 mmH2O, CSF biochemistry, routine and rubella virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma IgM, IgG antibodies were all normal. HIV antibody 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>. Immunological examination 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005-9-12)</u> showed that rheumatoid factor 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>, antinuclear antibody 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>, antineutrophil cytoplasimic antibody 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>, extractable nucler antigen antibody profile 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>, normal immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM), C-reactive protein is normal. Bilateral brainstem auditory evoked potential 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005-9-13)</u> showed no abnormalities. No seizures were observed by Video EEG 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005-1-25)</u>, and sharp slow waves were detected during awake and sleep stages in the right parietal occipital lobe. Muscle biopsy 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005-10-10)</u> suggested that muscle fibers had increased lipid droplets and some type II muscle fibers atrophy. Brain stereotactic biopsy 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005-10-11)</u> indicated neuronal degeneration in the right cortex, mild loss, a large number of heterotypic cells reactive hyperplasia, infiltration of CD8 positive microglia and a small number of lymphocytes, scattered nerve cells. Electromyography 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005-09-28)</u> results suggested that no obvious neurogenic and myogenic damage was found in the left and upper limb, and no obvious abnormalities were found in the left brachial plexus and bilateral lower limb sciatic nerve branches.\nDuring the latest follow-up on August 28th, 2019, the patient was currently engaged in copywriting and her educated level was high school. She was in a good mental state and could walk by herself. She had dragged on her left lower extremity, occasional small involuntary left forearm jitter. Physical examination showed that the speech was fluent and left facial was paralyzed. Muscle tension of left limb was higher than the right. Muscle strength of left upper limb was 4-level and that of left lower limb grade 4. Pathological signs were not elicited. The MMSE score was 30 points. The cranial MRI 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019-11-22)</u> confirmed the right cerebral hemisphere was extensively softened (long T1, long T2 signal, low signal on FLAIR), glia hyperplasia and perforation deformity (cavitated brain) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B and Figure 1C]</u>. The white matter fiber bundles in the affected side of the brain were significantly reduced, and most of the interruptions were absent. The N-acetylaspartate peak of the residual brain parenchyma significantly decreased, the choline peak and creatine peak did not change much, and no diffusion-restricted area was seen on DWI.\nRE is rare in the clinic, and the cause is unknown. However, its symptoms are severe, including unilateral hemisphere atrophy, refractory epilepsy, progressive hemiplegia, and mental impairment.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The cranial MRI can be normal in the early stage. Later, hemisphere tissue atrophy is progressively aggravated, and a few are bilateral diffuse brain atrophy.\nWe have followed up this patient for 16 years. We were surprised that the symptoms of hemiplegia are relatively mild in our patient, which strongly suggests that the plasticity of the children’s brains are very strong, and rehabilitation is an effective way to improve the neurological function. Patients who had hemispherectomy in childhood may retain surprisingly high levels of cognitive and sensorimotor abilities,通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> one possible reason is that children’s brains are more plastic. Previous study also found that the neural network connections in the remaining side of the brain of these people were stronger.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> This study demonstrates that people with only one hemisphere of the brain not only showed complete normal neural network connections, but also had a similar connectivity pattern compared to those people with two hemisphere brain. Insights from these rare patients argue that intrinsic mechanisms of brain organization in only half of the typically available cortex can be sufficient to support extensive cognitive compensation.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Language function has also shown near-complete recovery in many patients who had their language-dominant hemisphere resected.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Here, we proposed that some circuits can perform similar functions. Another explanation is that the patient’s hemisphere brain developed alternative neural circuits for performing the specific functions. The cranial MRI suggests that the neural networks can compensate for each together as long as those important neural networks are not destroyed. All in all, our study suggested that the circuit and function of the brain can be reshaped by the training. We will continue to follow up and do related genetic testing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

However, only a few studies have published data concerning the outcomes of patients with stages Ⅱ and Ⅲ breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods This study retrospectively investigated the clinical value of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stages Ⅱ and Ⅲ breast cancer. The patients in Group 1 (n=54) were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by definitive surgery and adjuvant therapy. The patients in Group 2 (n=43) initially received definitive surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and other therapies. The operability rates for breast conservation and dermatoplasty were observed in Group 1 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After follow-up, the recurrence and overall and disease-free survival rates of the two groups were analyzed.Results Neoadjuvant chemotherapy increased the operability rates for breast conservation from 17.1% to 40.0% in stage Ⅱ (P=0.034) and 0% to 12.6% in stage Ⅲ (P=0.016), and decreased the dermatoplasty rates from 17.1% to 2.8% in stage Ⅱ (P=0.046) and 28.1% to 8.1% in stage Ⅲ (P=0.026). After a median follow-up of 46.8 months, there were 11 deaths and 13 recurrences in Group 1, and 15 deaths and 19 recurrences in Group 2. The overall and disease-free survival rates of stage Ⅲ disease were significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (68.4% vs 31.2%, P=0.028, and 63.2% vs 25.0%, P=0.024, respectively). There were no significant differences in the overall and disease-free survival rates of stage Ⅱ disease for Group 1 compared with Group 2 (85.7% vs 85.2%, P=0.953, and 80.6% vs 74.1%, P=0.400, respectively).Conclusions Neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in increased operability for breast conservation and decreased dermatoplasty. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy exhibited better recurrence control, and overall and disease-free survival rates in stage Ⅲ disease. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not confer greater survival on stage Ⅱ disease。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

During the period of latent infection or the period of incubation following infection, the disease may be infectious. As in cases of influenza, some patients develop only upper respiratory tract infection, whereas others with a severe form of the disease develop pneumonia. Patients may not have fever, mild cough, or apparent respiratory symptoms, and headache or gastrointestinal symptoms may be present. Some patients show insidious onset and slow progression, and do not appear to be sick. Thus, they may not receive attention or be identified. Some patients with severe disease or critical illness may present with moderate-to-low-grade fever, but apparent fever may also be absent.\nEven though several clinical studies have assessed the use of corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe viral pneumonia, it remains unclear whether corticosteroids treatment can decrease mortality and improve patients’ outcomes.\nIn ARDS, corticosteroids are believed to antagonize certain pathophysiologic processes, including hyperinflammation, excessive cell proliferation, and aberrant collagen deposition.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> However, evidence-based clinical research gives us other insights. As for severe acute respiratory syndrome, a retrospective study revealed that patients receiving corticosteroids treatment had poorer outcomes, such as higher risk of intensive care unit admission and higher mortality, even though they were younger and had fewer underlying diseases.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Furthermore, it was found that corticosteroids did not improve mortality and could delay viral nucleic acid clearance in Middle-East respiratory syndrome, which is also caused by a coronavirus.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> A large meta-analysis which included 16 studies on influenza A virus subtype H1N1 infection showed that corticosteroids increased mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nIn contrast, other studies reported that short-term treatment with corticosteroids may decrease the risk of ARDS and shorten the length of the disease in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> In addition, the use of corticosteroids in ARDS caused by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia has obtained widespread acceptance, as it can improve oxygenation and patients’ outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> At present, the World Health Organization does not recommend routinely applying systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of viral pneumonia or ARDS, except in clinical trials.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> However, the \"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol (5th edition, trial)\" recommended short-term (3-5 days) treatment with corticosteroids for severely and critically ill cases should be based on the comprehensive assessment of patients’ dyspnea level and the progression observed on chest imaging, with the dose not exceeding a methylprednisolone equivalent dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Currently, there is insufficient evidence of the value of corticosteroids in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and further high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are warranted.\nDespite the numerous RCTs on ARDS in the last 30 years, there has been no significant reduction in ARDS mortality. ARDS caused by 2019-nCoV appears to be more severe than that observed routinely. In this outbreak of COVID-19, the majority of critically ill patients have been aged 50 years and above, with a large number of them aged 70 to 80 years. These patients often had underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart diseases, with some having multiple underlying diseases.\nOur previous clinical experience and observations indicated that many patients with severe illness receiving high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] of 1.0) have oxygenation indexes (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2]/FiO2) below 150 mmHg or even lower than 100 mmHg. We observed that such oxygenation support was required for a longer time, indicating that the hypoxic duration in these patients was longer. Extended durations of hypoxia can cause irreversible organ damage. Even with the subsequent use of invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the rate of successful resuscitation in such patients remains very low. Therefore, we suggest that patients with an oxygenation index below 150 mmHg after being treated with NIV for 2 h with an FiO2 of 1.0 or a relatively high FiO2 should receive endotracheal intubation as soon as possible to enable invasive ventilation. WHO’s interim guidance also suggested that HFNC and NIV should only be used in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, and patients treated with either HFNC or NIV should be closely monitored for clinical deterioration.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\nIf oxygenation index remains below 100 mmHg after invasive ventilation for 24 h with high positive endexpiratory pressure in prone position, ECMO should be used promptly. This is consistent with the recommendations of Chinese Society of Extracorporeal Life Support.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> The \"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol (5th edition, trial)\" also recommended that endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be performed promptly if the condition does not improve or even deteriorate within a short period of time (1-2 h) when using HFNC or NIV, and in case invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position is ineffective, ECMO should be performed at the earliest if possible.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>\nThe use of personal experience to guide treatment is not recommended. Supportive treatment remains the mainstay for COVID-19. Respiratory support ensures that the patient is not hypoxic and also protects other organs. There are currently no effective anti-viral drugs, and anti-microbial drugs should be administered strictly and rationally. Shuanghuanglian and similar drugs have demonstrated inhibitory effects against the virus in in vitro experiments. However, their clinical effects are unknown, and further investigations are required to demonstrate their efficacy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Under the guidance and support of a series of national policies, the development of Internet Plus healthcare in China has come a long way. Till 2021, more than 900 Internet hospitals have been established and over 24,000 medical institutions have been carrying out telemedicine cooperation 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) plays an increasingly prominent role in optimizing medical resource allocation, innovating service mode, improving service efficiency, and reducing medical treatment cost 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. On the basis of summarizing the role information technology played in the healthcare system during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, this paper discussed the problems to be solved as well as the application prospect of information technology in the healthcare system in the post-COVID era.\nIn the battle against COVID-19, smart medical platforms have become the second battlefield to fight against the epidemic. Health services related to the \"digital world\" , such as online diagnosis and treatment, science popularization for epidemic prevention, artificial intelligence, health code and other technologies, have been fully utilized to jointly build a three-dimensional and all-round anti-epidemic protection wall to protect people’s health 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u>.\nIn terms of early warning and monitoring, China’s local governments and relevant departments used big data to study and determine the trend of epidemic, screen and track the source of infection, in order to take the initiative to control the epidemic. For example, Zhejiang province was the first to implement \"one chart, one code, one index\" based on big data. Mainstream media such as the People’s Daily, Xinhua News Agency, and technology companies such as Alibaba and ByteDance, broadcasted the epidemic updates in real time through websites, apps and other channels, accurate to the community-level 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Using the big data advantages brought by real-name ticketing system, \"12306\" was able to provide information about close contacts. Users can confirm whether they were traveling with confirmed cases through the \"Query Tool of Traveling with Confirmed Cases\" .\nIn terms of screening and diagnosis, intelligent thermometers have been used in China to quickly and accurately identify people with abnormal body temperatures in crowds. Relying on the \"Artificial Intelligence plus Computed Tomography (AI + CT)\" intelligent diagnostic system, a diagnosis can be made within 10 seconds by importing the patient’s symptoms, epidemiological history, CT images and other data, with an accuracy rate of 98%, which greatly improves the COVID-19 screening rate and diagnostic accuracy.\nIn terms of medical treatment, China has launched policies such as \"Notification of Providing Online Diagnosis, Treatment and Consultation Services during the Epidemic Prevention and Control\" and \"Guidance on Promoting 'Internet Plus’ Healthcare Services during COVID-19 Prevention and Control\" to encourage the medical service mode innovation, and provide online health insurance direct settlement to electronic prescription, doctor fees and expenses for medicine, which is an improvement from the policies of Internet hospitals before. Under the guidance of favorable policies, many hospitals have established Internet hospitals for the outpatient process, actively built diversified and convenient online appointment platforms, and implemented real-name appointment for medical treatment at different times 通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u>. In terms of optimizing the medical treatment process, it provides AI medical guide triage, waiting list reminder, inter-clinic settlement, mobile payment, push and mutual recognition of inspection and laboratory results, drug distribution services, etc. creating a one-stop service platform integrating consultation, prescription, payment and drug distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. According to statistics, the Internet diagnosis and treatment in the hospitals directly under the jurisdiction of National Health Commission increased by 17 times in 2020 compared with the same period last year 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. AI, fifth generation (5G) mobile networks, Internet of Things, and remote systems are widely used in the hospitalization process. For example, Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital used intelligent voice medical records, makeshift hospitals in Wuhan used unmanned transport vehicles and disinfection robots, etc. Hainan People’s Hospital used electronic care-giver identity cards (IDs), and some hospitals used precise infusion monitoring and 5G remote ultrasound, which all effectively reduced cross-infection and improved work efficiency. Reports from leading management consulting company, McKinsey & Co. pointed out that COVID-19 has led to rapid growth in multiple telemedicine modes, with user recognition rising to 76% from 11% in 2019.\nIn terms of scientific and technological breakthroughs, AI can effectively reduce the repetitive work in virus detection, and promote drug research and development through effective screening of compounds, biomarkers and prediction of physicochemical properties of drugs, etc.\nIn general, information technology has played an important role in alleviating patients’ needs for medical treatment and improving anti-epidemic efficiency during COVID-19, demonstrating a broad prospect of a healthcare industry empowered by informatization.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has brought huge challenges to people’s health, life, and property, as well as the economic and social development. The amount of services provided by medical institutions in the healthcare industry has declined dramatically. According to the Statistical Information Center of the National Health Commission, in the first half of 2020, the total number of visits made to medical institutions recorded 3.27 billion, decreasing by 21.6% year-on-year. In the post-COVID-19 era, to speed up the resumption of efficient operation of the healthcare system, we should not only continue to optimize the demanded operations in \"peacetime\" , but also meet the requirements of \"wartime\" in the new era. Through the innovative application of information technology, we can provide medical services with \"no contact and few gathering\" . At present, although the informatization of healthcare system is booming in all parts of China, it also faces some bottlenecks in development.\nThe sharing of health information is the foundation of online medical care and smart medical care. Especially when pandemic occurs, public health researchers, epidemiologists, and government officials need to be connected via integrated systems with connected data to understand the evolving pandemic better and make collective decisions on addressing it 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Although at present, the national-level platforms have realized data sharing and exchange with the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State Administration for Market Regulation, the State Taxation Administration and other ministries in China, on the micro level, there is no information interconnection among medical institutions. It is known that in 2018, the average function level of electronic medical record application in tertiary public hospitals was 2.72, which was still at the level of inter-departmental data exchange 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The assessment of connectivity maturity was generally around level 4, while the assessment of smart services was at level 3.\nThe internal data in medical institutions are mainly derived from hospital information system (HIS), picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), laboratory information management system (LIS), electronic medical record (EMR) and other application systems. For other resources of potential data, such as access control management, logistics robots, sensors and so on, they are either not developed or not utilized due to compatibility problems. Different medical institutions use different information systems, with low level of standardization, unclear ownership, right of use and management, and are difficult to connect with each other. These problems make it hard to integrate them, thus seriously hinder the informatization and intelligent development of medical services in various provinces and cities.\nMedical institutions and enterprises have built online platforms for diagnosis and treatment after this public health emergency; however, the emerging information technology market needs further development. In terms of artificial intelligence, three elements for its development are data, computing power and algorithms. However, due to the lack of data quality, computing power and algorithm innovation, the popularization of artificial intelligence is affected. In terms of the Internet, the current service is limited to online follow-up, including 10 types of services such as remote monitoring, remote consultation, remote diagnosis and so on. According to the Survey Report on Hospital Information during the COVID-19 epidemic, online consultation was the most frequently used in internet hospitals during the epidemic. In addition, current supportive policies are incomplete. For example, the pricing of online services varies greatly among provinces, the examination fee is 4.5 yuan at Internet hospitals in Hubei province, and it varies from 3.6 to 15 yuan in Tianjin. In terms of the smart hospitals, though it was proposed in 2019 that the services include \"smart medical care\" , \"smart service\" and \"smart management\" , hospitals mainly provide \"smart service\" for patients, and need further improve other core medical services, such as closed-loop smart management of specific diseases in perioperative period.\nInformation in the health industry includes the citizens’ personal information and the country’s sensitive information, which is essential for stability of the society. Opening up medical information to the outside world increases the risks of network security regarding the rapid development of Internet Plus healthcare this year. Although online medical supervision platforms have been established at the provincial level in 30 provinces to supervise online behaviors including doctors’ qualifications and their prescriptions so as to ensure the safety of medical services, medical institutions still need to strengthen data security. According to China’s Medical Informatization Industry Report 2018-2019 released by the Information Management Committee of Chinese Hospital Association, 839 hospitals were surveyed with only 43.95% having passed the classified protection of cybersecurity, while 75% of primary and secondary hospitals surveyed have not implemented the classified protection of cybersecurity. In 2018, a healthcare provider in Singapore was attacked by hackers, resulting in the release of medical records of about 1.5 million patients.\nThe Law of the People’s Republic of China on Basic Healthcare and Health Promotion states clearly the legal consequences of revealing the personal health information by medical institutions and healthcare personnel. But when it comes to internet-based medical services, there is no designated law or regulation on collection, use and storage, sharing, and disclosure notification of personal health information on the online health platforms. In terms of the management regulations, security management regulations for internet hospitals should be made including their access and supervision, and further guidelines for implementation should be added to the National Standard of Information Security Technology—Personal Information Security Specification to protect personal information.\nAt present, China is in its golden age of accelerating the construction of new infrastructures, while the healthcare industry push to promote Internet Plus in medical care so that the data runs the errands instead of people. \"Promoting telemedicine\" is clearly proposed in the 14th Five-Year Plan (FYP) 通用删除7(英):<u>(2021-2025)</u> for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035. In the phase of regular epidemic prevention and control, the informatization construction of healthcare system will focus on the overall lifelong health of patients, and move towards a highly shared, convenient and safe direction.\nIn the past 10 years, the National Health Commission has successively issued a number of policy documents, management regulations, and standards related to regional health informatization construction. From the perspective of governance of a city, smart medical services should be integrated into the construction of smart city by means of top-level design and overall planning, and connected with emergency command system, smart transportation and smart government. Once a major public health emergency occurs, the smart medical system will start the early warning system according to the intelligent algorithm, and the emergency command center will respond with an emergency plan according to the level of emergency predicted by the early warning system, and establish a scientific decision-making model to control the spread of epidemic . From the perspective of healthcare industry, normative data standards should be defined, compatible information system management software should be installed, and a network system supporting health informatization within a region, based on the interconnection of national, provincial, municipal and district/county platforms, should be established as soon as possible to ensure the compatibility and sharing of data within the region. Meanwhile, coordinated development of medical institutions within a region should be oriented according to the guideline of national policies, and sharing of medical information within a region should be realized based on the construction of medical consortium so as to expand quality resources.\nAt the national level, it is suggested to increase supportive policies around the integration of \"medical-patient-drug-insurance\" information. For example, we should further improve the scope and tiered pricing of online services in various provinces, and explore the establishment of a national or provincial platform sharing and circulating electronic prescriptions by internet hospitals and a uniform platform for medical insurance settlement. As for medical institutions, it is suggested to promote smart hospital construction by providing medical services centered on overall lifelong health of patients and integrating online and offline services before, during and after diagnosis. Smart services should extend from medical consultation to a whole process of services for common diseases and chronic diseases. Smart management should rebuild an online process of diagnosis and treatment like a physical hospital and even provide further medical services . A medical ecosystem integrating producing, teaching, and researching by hospitals, suppliers, logistics, third-party medical service organizations, research and development (R&D) institutes will be gradually formed.\nAt the national level, it is suggested to improve policies and regulations, establish industry standards, and enrich the content of provincial information supervision platforms. At the hospital level, it is suggested to strengthen information security management and optimize technical means, improve management regulations for information system security and doctor-patient information security. Moreover, it is suggested to build information security system and a closed-loop safety workflow of threat prediction, threat protection, continuous monitoring, response and disposal, including 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> risk pre-control: software should be selected in accordance with ISO27034 standard and safety principles, hardware should be strengthened through update and maintenance; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> risk monitoring and control: safety of hardware/software devices and network environment should be comprehensively monitored, monitoring and early warning system for online information security should be established and improved; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> defense construction: protection of internet-based medical information security should be strengthened by applying antivirus software, intrusion detection system, vulnerability scanning system, data encryption technology, data desensitization technology and other technical means 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> emergency support: emergency plans and measures should be formulated and specified regarding hardware system, software system, machine room environment, information security management, etc. and emergency drill should be regularly carried out. At the individual level, it is suggested to establish the privacy protection awareness of medical staff and patients through various forms such as training, popularization and education.\nIn general, digital technologies such as Internet and big data have been proven to be indispensable in response to COVID-19 and become the core force for the comprehensive breakthrough and development of the healthcare industry in the post-COVID-19 era. The next step is to further carry out technology research and development and continuous improvement around key areas such as smart medical treatment, big data mining, information sharing, family health and medical information security. Meanwhile, increased financial investment and training of \"5G medical\" inter-disciplinary talents are proposed to ensure stability and sustainability and to contribute to the construction of a healthy China.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

In conjunction with the advent of sedentary lifestyles in both industrialized and developing countries, this trend of changing dietary patterns is highly associated with the increasing epidemic of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> The rapid increase in pediatric obesity and NAFLD has become one of the major public health concerns globally. Sugars in the form of sucrose (half fructose) or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS, about 45-55% fructose) are major sweeteners added in food and beverages, which comprise a large proportion of the modern diet, in particular in children, adolescents, and young adults. In Western diets, added sugars account for about 14% to 17% of the total caloric intake, which is above the recommended level of 10% of the total caloric intake according to the World Health Organization’s guidelines.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> In China, the past decades have seen a great increase in the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), according to the China National Nutrition Surveys (CNNS).通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> It is well recognized that excessive consumption of added sugars is a risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases, and has been a big public health problem.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> Therefore, recommendations for the restriction of sugar consumption attract significant attention. As the major component of added sugar, fructose is a monosaccharide with a similar formulary to glucose. However, its metabolism pathway is quite different from glucose in vivo.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,9]</u> There is substantial evidence that excessive fructose intake has detrimental effects on multiple metabolic diseases. It causes visceral fat accumulation and leads to obesity, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperuricemia, which are associated with development of diabetes, fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and gout.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6,10]</u> Even for those in the \"normal\" range of fructose consumption, fructose can still rapidly impair intermediate physiological endpoints like circulating lipids and insulin sensitivity in humans.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Therefore, further understanding fructose metabolism and its role in the development of metabolic diseases will provide fundamental insights into pathogenic mechanisms, which assists to develop new diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies for metabolic disease. In this review, we aim to illuminate the physiological and biochemical characteristics of fructose metabolism as well as its association with metabolic diseases.\nDietary fructose is predominantly absorbed from the intestinal lumen and transported across apical membrane, which is mediated by the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) family members.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,12]</u> Both GLUT5 and GLUT2 are able to facilitate fructose transportation, but GLUT5 shows higher affinity for fructose. Fructose absorption occurs mainly in the brush border of the lower part of the duodenum and jejunum via GLUT5 and translocated into the circulation through GLUT2.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> In intestinal epithelial cells, fructose induces GLUT5 expression and activation to facilitate its translocation in an energy-independent manner. This sensibility of GLUT5 for fructose thereby triggers intracellular signaling in response to nutrient concentrations.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> As a consequence, GLUT5 deficiency leads to intestinal fructose malabsorption as well as intestinal dysfunction.\nThe vast majority of fructose in vivo is derived from the dietary source of sugar, while it can also be synthesized endogenously through sorbitol (polyol) pathway. This metabolic route exists in a wide range of tissues and is regulated by two enzymes: aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase. Glucose is first converted to sorbitol by aldose reductase, and then oxidized to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Physiologically, endogenous fructose is produced as a source of energy mainly for sperm and fertility as well as for fetus development. In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of sorbitol dehydrogenase, aldose reductase expression is largely limited to the hypertonic areas of the inner medulla and papilla in the kidney; therefore, the sorbitol pathway was once considered to be inactive in the majority of tissues other than those in kidney. As a result, the locally produced and accumulated sorbitol helps maintain osmotic pressure for a proper urinary concentrating mechanism.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Therefore, circulating fructose levels are much lower than that of glucose.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> The estimated blood concentration of fructose in human and laboratory rodents ranges from 6 μmol/L to 1500 μmol/L, as determined by mass spectrometry detection (only ~1/1000 of glucose level in circulation).通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u> Recent studies suggest that the sorbitol pathway can also be active in brain.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19,20]</u> In this regard, researchers have reported the fructokinase expression and fructose metabolism in the brain, as well as the endogenous fructose generation in the hypothalamus, for the production and release of vasopressin.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> In addition, the endogenous fructose and activated sorbitol pathways are also considered to be a contributor to diabetic microvascular complication. There is some evidence supporting the view that endogenous fructose production and ketohexokinase (KHK) activation within the kidney contribute to the development of diabetic nephropathy.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Meanwhile, glucose activates the sorbitol pathway both in humans and mice, which could be a mechanism for the exacerbated cardiometabolic risks by severe hyperglycemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> The question of whether endogenous fructose is involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases needs to be addressed by further investigation.\nCellular glucose is catalyzed by glucokinase to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and eventually enters the glycolysis pathway after a series of catalytic reactions. Remarkably, fructose metabolism occurs via a divergent pathway with distinctive metabolic consequences.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> The canonical pathway of fructose metabolism is fructolysis, that is initiated by KHK to produce fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P). F-1-P is then cleaved by aldolase B into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde is phosphorylated by triokinase to generate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP). GAP and other triose phosphates are resynthesized into glucose via gluconeogenesis or converged with glycolytic pathway to enter the lipogenesis or oxidation pathways.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Incontrast to glucose, intracellular fructose is rapidly phosphorylated by KHK due to the lack of negative feedback of substrate, which depletes the cells of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphoric acids stores after intake of excessive fructose. The excessive cellular consumption of ATP stimulates adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase activation to catalyze AMP to hypoxanthine and eventually increases uric acid levels via purine pathway. Uric acid can be degraded by uricase in rodents. However, humans lack uricase, and that leads to the elevation of circulating uric acid after excessive fructose consumption, which might contribute as an evolutionary benefit通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nFructose concentrations are at a low level of 0.04 mmol/L in peripheral blood. After dietary fructose intake, it rapidly increases about 10 fold then returns to fasting levels within 2 h.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Dietary fructose metabolism is initiated in small intestine, which is a primary organ for fructose clearance.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Low doses of fructose are about 90% cleared by the intestine, with only trace fructose but extensive fructose-derived glucose, lactate, and glycerate entering the portal blood. Therefore, the small intestine not only provides a place for the absorption and metabolism of fructose, but also acts as a barrier to prevent a large amount of fructose from pouring into the liver, with potential toxic effects. The capacity to absorb fructose in healthy adults ranges from <5 g to >50 g.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> When fructose ingestion exceeds intestinal clearance capacity, the extra fructose is released into portal circulation at the disposal of the liver.\nThe liver is a central metabolic processor. It can sense and integrate peripheral nutrient status, thereby coordinating energy storage and consumption. It is also considered to be the major organ to dispose fructose in circulation.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,24]</u> Hepatic fructose uptake from portal circulation is mediated by GLUT2, which then undergoes further metabolism to produce substrates for multiple metabolic pathways, affecting both glucose and lipid homeostasis, and consequently contributing to the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> Kidney is also an important organ for fructose metabolism. Physiologically, fructose can be converted into glucose by renal gluconeogenesis. Although renal gluconeogenesis may result from classic substrates such as lactate, glutamine, alanine, and pyruvate, fructose appears to be the preferred substrate, based on the speed and efficiency of the reaction.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> The proximal straight tubule, where the GLUT5 is expressed on the apical side of the cell membrane, is a primary site for urinary fructose uptake and subsequent metabolism by fructokinase. In addition, the proximal convoluted tubule is also found to express fructokinase and aldolase B, which can be rapidly induced by fructose. Aldolase B deficiency in the patients with hereditary fructose intolerance causes F-1-P accumulation in the proximal convoluted tubule. On the other hand, activation of fructose by fructokinase requires a phosphate, which decreases intracellular phosphate levels and depletes ATP. This process activates AMP deaminase and stimulates uric acid via purine pathway.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Therefore, an excessive amount of fructose, either from diet or as a result of endogenous production, leads to intracellular uric acid accumulation, which increases the risk of developing gout.\nThe development of fructose intolerance is closely related to abnormal expression and function of the enzymes critically involved in fructose absorption and metabolism.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Hereditary fructose intolerance, caused by catalytic deficiency of aldolase B, results in a serious defect of fructose metabolism along with an severe accumulation of F-1-P, which leads to hypoglycemic and severe abdominal symptoms as well as liver and kidney injury after fructose consumption.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> Another hereditary fructose intolerance is related to fructose bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), which has long been recognized as a key component to control the rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis in response to energy status. Individuals with FBP1 deficiency present with hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis after fructose consumption, due to impaired gluconeogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> The hereditary fructose intolerance is often fatal and increases mortality; however, the precise mechanism is not entirely clear so far.\nFructose intolerance is also caused by impaired fructose absorption. The ability of a healthy adult to absorb fructose daily is in the range of 5 to 50 g.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Unabsorbed fructose in the intestine can be excreted through feces or utilized by intestinal flora; the latter could lead to impaired intestinal flora homeostasis and intestinal barrier function, thereby causing gastrointestinal symptoms. Deletion of GLUT5 in mice reduces fructose absorption by 75% and causes fructose malabsorption with symptoms such as cecum and colon dilatation, and gas accumulation.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Intestinal GLUT5 expression levels are low prenatally and rapidly increase after weaning, which then can be further induced by diets containing fructose.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> In humans, fructose malabsorption is prevalent in infants, toddlers, and young children compared with that in adults; this is due to their low expression pattern of intestinal GLUT5.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> Therefore, GLUT5 has been considered as a potential pharmacologic candidate for the prevention of fructose-induced diseases.\nFructose metabolism is self-regulated in a flux-dependent manner. Under physiological condition, fructose clearance is accomplished through fructolysis and gluconeogenesis, which are initiated from intestinal absorption and metabolism, with the circulating fructose cleared in the liver and kidney. Each component of fructose metabolism pathway, which includes transporters and metabolic enzymes, controls the metabolic flux as well as the amount of intermediate metabolites to maintain metabolic homeostasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Therefore, the activity and expression of these components are likely to have robust and sustained effects on fructose metabolism. At the transcriptional level, the expression of genes critically involved in fructose metabolism is coordinately regulated by carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP).\nCarbohydrate-responsive element binding protein, a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor, was initially found to recognize and bind to the carbohydrate response element within the promoter of the gene encoding liver-type pyruvate kinase (LPK).通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35]</u> It has two isoforms, ChREBP-α and ChREBP-β, due to alternative usage of the promoters and the first exons. Each isoform is complexed with Mlx forms heterodimer to transcriptionally regulate expression of the target genes. The β isoform is expressed at extremely low levels; however, its transcriptional activity is much more potent than that of the α isoform.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> ChREBP is abundantly expressed in both liver and intestine,通用删除6(英):<u>[37,38]</u> and regulates transcription of many genes involved in monocarbohydrate transport, glycolysis, fructolysis, and de novo lipogenesis (DNL),通用删除6(英):<u>[37,39,40,41]</u> thereby contributing to glucose and lipid homeostasis. The target genes regulated by ChREBP are very extensive with different physiological significance. Among them, some are related to glucose metabolism such as LPK, G6P, GLUT4, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), and glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP), whereas some are related to lipid metabolism including fatty acid synthesis, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, very-long-chain fatty acid elongase 6 (Elovl6), stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase 1, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. It is particularly noteworthy to observe that the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), an important factor regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, is also a target of ChREBP.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>\nTo a lesser extent, ChREBP is also expressed in adipose tissue. We recently found that ChREBP-β overexpression in brown adipocytes downregulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and respiration, as well as thermogenesis (eg, Dio2, UCP1), which suggests that ChREBP acts as a negative regulator of thermogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> Thus, ChREBP plays an important role in sensing nutrient metabolism and maintaining energy homeostasis upon environmental changes.\nAlthough ChREBP was initially identified as a glucoseresponsive factor, phenotypical characterization of its global knockout mice first demonstrates that ChREBP is required for fructose tolerance.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> Upon fructose or sucrose ingestion, ChREBP-deficient mice exhibit high mortality, which was once linked to the diminished expression of enzymes required for fructolysis, such as aldolase B and KHK in the liver.通用删除6(英):<u>[38,44]</u> Given the consistent phenotype as manifested by a severely distended cecum along with proximal colon full of both gas and fluid contents, and severe diarrhea upon fructose ingestion, the relevance of intestinal ChREBP in fructose tolerance has been established in recent years. In the small intestine, ChREBP expression is robustly induced by high-fructose diet (HFrD), which is required for the subsequent activation of GLUT5 and the genes involved in fructolysis and gluconeogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> In the absence of ChREBP, insufficient induction of intestinal GLUT5 could be the main reason for fructose intolerance. Therefore, as an important site for fructose absorption and metabolism, small intestine is highly regulated by ChREBP in response to dietary fructose stimulation.\nThe liver is the major organ for the disposal of circulating fructose; however, the role of ChREBP in liver fructose metabolism is controversial. Fructose can produce multiple intracellular carbohydrate metabolites that activate hepatic ChREBP independently of hepatic insulin signaling.通用删除6(英):<u>[38,46,47]</u> In both rats and mice, high fructose feeding increases hepatic carbohydrate metabolites as well as the activity of ChREBP and its target genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[38,48]</u> Another recent study also indicates that fructose-activated ChREBP stimulates hepatic FGF21 expression and secretion, which participates in an adaptive response to fructose consumption.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> Although it has been observed that HFrD activates hepatic lipogenesis in a ChREBP-dependent manner, ChREBP-null mice chronically fed with a high fructose diet exhibit severe steatohepatitis and early signs of fibrosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u> This unexpected finding complexes the role of fructose-activated ChREBP in hepatic lipid metabolism. Jois et al通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> generated a liver-specific ChREBP-α knockout mice with the deletion of exon 1a, while the alternative promoter and expression cassette of ChREBP-β was intact. They demonstrated that deletion of hepatic ChREBP caused insulin resistance, but did not change liver glycogen contents or the expression of ChREBP target genes in liver glycolysis and lipogenesis. Using another liver-specific knockout mice model, Linden et al通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u> show an approximately two-fold increase in liver glycogen contents and a mild increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase levels in HFrD-fed mutant mice, without significant morphological abnormality in the liver. In contrast, our recent study demonstrates that liver-specific ablation of ChREBP causes severe transaminitis and hepatomegaly with massive glycogen-overload in mice fed with an HFrD without significant inflammation, cell death, or fibrosis in the liver, suggesting that liver ChREBP protects mice against fructose-induced hepatotoxicity by regulating liver glycogen metabolism and ATP homeostasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> These substantial evidences demonstrate a protective role of liver ChREBP in fructose-induced hepatic toxicity. The marked difference in fructose-induced liver response in the abovementioned knockout mouse model is most likely caused by the difference of gene targeting and mouse genetic background. Nevertheless, the mechanism and biological significance of differential responsiveness of the ChREBP target genes to fructose requires further investigation 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nThe expression and activity of ChREBP are tightly regulated by carbohydrate in the liver.通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> At the post-translational level, its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity depend on glucose-modulated phosphorylation and acetylation.通用删除6(英):<u>[54,55]</u> At the transcriptional level, ChREBP-α is activated by glucose,通用删除6(英):<u>[56,57]</u> possibly through its metabolites, the identity of which remains subject to much uncertainty.通用删除6(英):<u>[47,58]</u> It is worth noting that ChREBP-α has been identified as one of the direct target genes of liver X receptor and thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ) in the liver.通用删除6(英):<u>[59,60,61]</u> Although these nuclear receptors are involved in transcriptional regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism,通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63,64]</u> neither of them is necessary for the induction of ChREBP expression by glucose or refeeding.通用删除6(英):<u>[56,61]</u> So far, the molecular mechanism for the regulation of ChREBP expression is still unknown. Our previous study identified a new member of C2H2 subfamily of zinc finger proteins, named as zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 20 (ZBTB20),通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> which is responsive to carbohydrate stimulation and capable of binding to and activating ChREBP-α gene, thus regulating the expression of ChREBP-driven metabolic genes in the liver.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> ZBTB20 is abundantly expressed in adult hepatocytes. Tissue-specific deletion of ZBTB20 results in a marked decrease in ChREBP-α expression and a dramatic decline of ChREBP-β expression levels upon fructose stimulation, protecting the mice against fructose-induced steatosis. Our finding points to ZBTB20 as a toplevel critical regulator in the hierarchy of ChREBP-regulated fructose metabolism pathway in the liver, providing a novel insight into the transcriptional regulation of ChREBP. However, ZBTB20 is hardly expressed in the intestinal epithelial cells. Therefore, the regulation of ChREBP pathway in different tissues needs further investigation.\nIn humans, dietary fructose functions as an energy source that can be deposited as fat and glycogen. Hepatocytes are able to convert fructose-derived carbon into glucose, glycogen, lactate, lipid, carbon dioxide, and/or other metabolites.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u> Isotope-labeled metabolic tracer techniques provide a novel way to quantitatively evaluate the conversion and oxidation of ingested fructose, even in human bodies. In healthy subjects, after acute fructose ingestion, about 29% to 54% fructose is converted to glucose and then further incorporated into glycogen, 28% fructose is converted to lactate, and a small trace enters DNL pathway.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Fructose-derived metabolites enter the triose-phosphate pool, bypassing the phosphofructokinase (PFK)-restricted glycolytic flux, which results in unrestricted hepatic fructolysis. Thus, fructose-overloads lead to large, rapid expansions in the hexose-and triosephosphate pools, providing increasing substrate for multiple metabolic pathway, including glycogen and lipogenesis for energy storage.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Very recently, Zhao et al通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> report that dietary fructose feeds hepatic lipogenesis via microbiota-derived acetate, indicating a potential role of microbiota in the pathogenesis of fructose-induced metabolic disease.\nFructose has been regarded as a potent adipogenic nutrient. Chronic fructose intake increases the adipogenic potential on adipocyte precursor cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> Although glucose and fructose consumption exhibit similar effects on weight gain, fructose-sweetened, but not glucose-sweetened, beverages increase visceral adiposity, induce dyslipidemia, and impair insulin sensitivity in overweight/obese humans.通用删除6(英):<u>[70]</u> The precise molecular mechanism of fructose-induced insulin resistance is related to proinflammatory changes and endoplasmic reticulum stress in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), as well as adiponectin resistance.通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u> According to the study by Marek et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u> excessive fructose causes not only visceral fat accumulation but also macrophage infiltration and production of proinflammatory cytokines in the VAT, including TNF-α and MCP-1. This low-grade inflammation status in the adipose tissue in obesity is widely recognized as a major cause of insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. In addition, they also found the impairment of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function caused by fructose load, as evidenced by XBP1 activation and decreased Ero-1α expression. Their evidence may provide an important mechanism for pathogenesis of insulin resistance and progression of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease that are associated with increasing consumption of fructose-sweetened foods in modern societies.\nThe sweetness of added sugar increases the palatability of food and beverages, thereby stimulating appetite and encouraging overeating. In rats, both glucose and fructose increase caloric intake, resulting in increased serum leptin, decreased serum peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY). However, fructose vs. glucose increases circulating levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin as well as hypothalamic levels of endocannabinoids and cannabinoid receptor CB1 mRNA.通用删除6(英):<u>[72,73]</u> In humans, fructose relative to glucose results in a smaller increase in systemic glucose, insulin, and glucagon-like polypeptide 1 (GLP-1) levels, with an insufficient induction of satiety. Functional magnetic resonance imaging based studies show that consumption of fructose relative to glucose resulted in greater hypothalamic blood flow and activation of brain regions that are involved in attention and reward processing, which may promote feeding behavior.通用删除6(英):<u>[74,75]</u>\nAlthough the question remains controversial as to whether fructose consumption is a major contributor to the epidemics of metabolic syndrome,通用删除6(英):<u>[76,77,78]</u> SSB have been considered as an independent risk factor for metabolic diseases.通用删除6(英):<u>[79]</u> Studies in both young people and adults have suggested that excessive fructose consumption may lead to adverse metabolic effects, such as dyslipidemia, increased visceral adiposity, and fatty liver disease,通用删除6(英):<u>[80,81]</u> which in turn increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, short-term fructose restriction decreases liver fat, VAT, and DNL, and improves insulin kinetics in children with obesity.通用删除6(英):<u>[82]</u>\nThere are plenty of studies which support the contention that fructose consumption is closely associated with weight gain or obesity due to increased caloric intake.通用删除6(英):<u>[83,84,85]</u> On the other hand, fructose induces adipogenesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and glucocorticoid activation to promote adiposity.通用删除6(英):<u>[86,87]</u> For example, fructose stimulates 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) - expression and activity, thereby promoting the adipogenic effects of glucocorticoids.通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u> In addition, fructose-induced leptin resistance may be a contributing factor to dysregulated energy metabolism and weight gain,通用删除6(英):<u>[88]</u> given the key role of leptin in satiety response and energy expenditure.通用删除6(英):<u>[89]</u>\nIt is worthy to note that there are divergent effects of fructose and glucose on metabolic disorders due to their distinct metabolic pathways. Kuzma et al通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u> reported that short-term overconsumption of high glucose-sweetened beverages significantly increases fasting plasma insulin levels in healthy humans. Rather than fructose, glucose promotes blood glucose levels as well as insulin secretion, more directly. Glucose-stimulated glycemic load may be a determinant of fasting insulin concentrations. Previous reports suggest that consumption of foods with a high glycemic index is a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance,通用删除6(英):<u>[91]</u> and pure glucose, by definition, has the highest glycemic index. Therefore, in a short time, glucose beverage was sufficient to induce chronic hyperglycemia and concomitant hyperinsulinemia. Although fructose intake seems not to stimulate insulin secretion, chronic fructose stimulation renders pancreatic β-cells hyper-responsive to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through extracellular ATP signaling.通用删除6(英):<u>[92]</u> Moreover, it readily induces hyperinsulinemia in both rodent models and human subjects,通用删除6(英):<u>[10,93]</u> most likely as a result of insulin resistance.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> There is some evidence to support the role of fructose-induced hepatic lipogenesis in insulin resistance, which may be associated with diacylglycerol accumulation, protein kinase C ε activation, and impaired insulinmediated Akt2 activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[94,95]</u> However, the precise role and mechanism of fructose in insulin resistance need to be intensively explored.\nExcessive fructose consumption may have significant effects on lipid metabolism, contributing to steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Even in the setting of insulin resistance, it stimulates hepatic lipid accumulation through increasing hepatic DNL because fructose metabolism does not require insulin. Fructose consumption activates lipogenic program immediately and then contributes to increased triglyceriderich very-low-density lipoprotein secretion,通用删除6(英):<u>[96,97]</u> whereas it acutely suppresses hepatic fatty acid oxidation.通用删除6(英):<u>[98]</u> Thus, fructose stimulates hepatic triglyceride production both by providing substrate for fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis and by activating signaling systems to enhance lipid production.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Meanwhile, fructose can increase transcriptional regulation of DNL by activating key transcription factors, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and ChREBP.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,99]</u> This fructose-induced DNL has been strongly correlates with NAFLD and hypertriglyceridemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[100,101,102]</u>\nIt is well established that fructose enhances hepatic lipogenesis; however, so far the association between fructose and cholesterol metabolism has been poorly appreciated. Based on a cross-sectional study among 6113 US adults in 1999-2006, there was a statistically significant correlation between dietary added sugars and unfavorable blood lipid levels, namely lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and higher triglycerides levels in fructose consumers, and higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels in women.通用删除6(英):<u>[103]</u> A short-term (3.5 inpatient days) intervention study showed that HFCS intake with 10% to 25% of energy requirement increased postprandial triglyceride, and 17.5% to 25.0% of energy requirement increased fasting and/or postprandial LDL cholesterol.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Recent animal studies show that high fructose diet induces elevation of hepatic cholesterol, which can be abolished by deletion of hepatic ChREBP in mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> It is further confirmed by us that hepatic-specific ChREBP knockout mice show decreasing level of total and free cholesterol in the liver.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> These data indicate a potential role of ChREBP in fructose-regulated cholesterol metabolism. Since multiple organs are involved in cholesterol absorption, synthesis, transport, clearance, and biotransformation, it is worthwhile to clarify the precise molecular mechanism of excess fructose-mediated cholesterol metabolism disorder.\nA large body of evidence revealed the association of excessive consumption of fructose with hyperuricemia in both animals and humans, and for this reason, fructose has been recognized to be a potential risk for developing hyperuricemia and gout.通用删除6(英):<u>[104,105,106]</u> Despite the conflicting studies on the relationship between fructose consumption and hyperuricemia, it is undeniable that excessive fructose intake is potentially related to the risk of hyperuricemia. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004 data-bases and a logistic regression model reveal no significant correlation between fructose intake and hyperuricemia risk.通用删除6(英):<u>[107]</u> There is a meta-analysis showing an undesirable association between SSB and fruit juice intake with the risk of gout, but no association with fruit intake.通用删除6(英):<u>[108]</u> In fact, the majority of studies support that high fructose intake can lead to hyperuricemia. In a meta-analysis involving 125,299 participants, it is shown that high fructose consumption corresponds with an increased risk of gout.通用删除6(英):<u>[105]</u> Also, a substantial correlation between SSB consumption and the elevated risk of gout and hyperuricemia in adults is indicated in a systematic review and meta-analysis.通用删除6(英):<u>[109]</u> In addition, a cross-sectional survey based on the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) baseline data 通用删除7(英):<u>(2008-2010)</u> reports a substantially positive correlation of a high fructose intake with hyperuricemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[104]</u> A recent meta-analysis including 244 rats with diverse fructose feeding indicates a significant link of hyperuricemia to high fructose consumption.通用删除6(英):<u>[106]</u> Fructose rapidly generates F-1-P to push the fluxes of trioses for lipogenesis that causes depletion of ATP store and degradation of AMP. This process contributes to production of uric acid by purine pathway.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> As a result, uric acid activates the renin-angiotensin system and inhibits endothelial NO, thereby increasing blood pressure.通用删除6(英):<u>[110,111]</u> A systematic review of 18 prospective cohort studies demonstrate that incidence of hypertension increases by 13% per 1 mg/dL increment in serum uric acid level.通用删除6(英):<u>[112]</u> In addition to uric acid, fructose ingestion induces several other physiologic responses that contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension, which include gastrointestinal sodium absorption, renal sodium reabsorption, RAS system, and renal sympathetic nervous system.通用删除6(英):<u>[113]</u> Therefore, restriction of sugar consumption may be a practical means to prevent cardiovascular disease.\nExcessive fructose is an independent risk factor for metabolic diseases; therefore, restriction of dietary fructose intake is an important approach to preventing cardiometabolic diseases, and intervention of endogenous fructose production also receives increasing attention. While intestine, liver, and kidney are the major organs involved in fructose metabolism, the physiology and significance of brain in fructose metabolism need intensive investigation to better understand the effect of fructose on sweet taste preference and eating behavior. While there is some evidence to indicate that excessive fructose consumption affects cholesterol homeostasis, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism needs to be clarified. ChREBP is the master regulator of fructose metabolism; the means by which ChREBP senses fructose stimulation is still an enigma. Obtaining a better understanding of the biochemical regulatory mechanism of ChREBP pathway will definitely provide new insights to the regulation of fructose metabolism and its metabolic effects. Future advances in this field will benefit our efforts to achieve better cardiometabolic health.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Prior studies examining contamination in CRS patients found that within 2 weeks of use, 25% of irrigation bottles demonstrated bacterial growth, often with virulent bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, however, absence of clinical infections in patients with culture positive bottles led them to conclude that contamination did not affect clinical outcomes.3 In contrast, Keen et al4 argued that contaminated bottles may be a source of bacteria in CRS patient sinus infections. They found that 97% of bottles used by CRS patients demonstrated bacterial growth and 51% of patients had concurrent sinonasal and bottle infection with S. aureus. In addition, it is well known that 75% of CRS patients are generally non-compliant with sterilization techniques and unique bottle designs to prevent reflux of irrigant back into the bottle do not decrease contamination.5 Thus the clinical relevance and the source of these bacteria is unclear. Given that many CRS patients have bacterial infections prior to beginning irrigations, we elected to examine patients without CRS, to determine if such contamination still occurred. The objective of the present study is to determine if contamination of irrigation devices occurs in patients with AR, and if the contamination is clinically relevant.\nThis was a prospective pilot study of 10 patients. The study was approved by the Office of Research Integrity at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). MUSC IRB policies regarding informed consent and HIPAA were followed (HR #19154). Ten patients with AR as confirmed by the skin prick test (SPT) and on nasal steroids for at least one month were recruited for the study. Patients were asked to continue pharmacotherapy with nasal steroid along with low-pressure nasal irrigation with isotonic saline as an adjunctive therapy.\nAt the initial appointment, each patient was provided with two new sinus rinse bottles (NeilMed Pharmaceuticals, Santa Rosa, CA), labeled bottle A for morning use and bottle B for evening use. The patient was asked to return to the outpatient department at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks and thus were seen a total of three times during the study period. The patient was given supplies and instructions on the use of low-pressure pump with isotonic saline to be performed twice-a-day for eight weeks. Each Patient was instructed to rinse the bottle with commercially bottled water followed by adding dishwashing liquid to the interior. Attach the cap and tube to the bottle; hold finger over the opening in the cap and shake the bottle vigorously. Squeeze the bottle hard to allow the soapy solution to clean the interior of the tube and cap. Empty out the bottle completely. Rinse the soap from the bottle, cap and tube thoroughly and place the items on a clean paper towel to dry. At the end of week 4, bottle A was collected and was exchanged for a new bottle. Culture testing (aerobes, anaerobes, and fungal) was done by swabbing the bottle and nose piece. At the end of week 8, bottle B was collected and similar culture testing was done.\nAll graphs and data analyses were performed with Sigma- Plot 12.5 and SigmaStat 3.5 (Systat Software, Inc. San Jose, CA). Subject information and demographic variables, such as age, ethnic group and gender, were described with summary statistics. Simple descriptive statistics such as frequency, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum were calculated for all outcome variables.\nThere were 10 patients in this study (6 females, 4 males) with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, 22-51). Of the 10 patients, there were 6 Caucasians, 2 African Americans, and 2 Asians. All 10 patients completed the study with no missing appointment. Out of the 20 irrigation devices used (10 analyzed at week 4 and 10 analyzed at week 8), organisms were grown from 17 (85%). A total of 24 bacterial isolates with 14 different species were obtained from the nose pieces and bottles of the irrigation devices . Yeast was obtained from one isolate. Of the 10 devices assessed at week 4, bacterial isolates were obtained from 9 (90%). This included 70% of nose pieces and 50% of bottles, specific organisms are detailed in Table 1. For devices analyzed at week 8, 80% were contaminated, including 60% of nose pieces and 60% of bottles .\nSpecies of organism found in cultures of nasal irrigation devices after 4 and 8 weeks of use.\n删除重复语句：<u>Species of organism found in cultures of nasal irrigation devices after 4 and 8 weeks of use.</u>\nThere was no significant correlation between the length of bottle use and the degree of contamination (r = 0.13, p = 0.76). None of the patients developed acute sinus infections during the study period.\nOur study demonstrates contamination of nasal irrigation devices used by patients with AR and no signs of acute or chronic rhinosinusitis. Of all irrigation devices used, 85% were found to be contaminated, including the majority of both nose pieces and bottles. Though a variety of organisms were cultured, the most common were bacilli and staphylococcus.\nOur proportion of contamination agrees with CRS studies showing that the majority of devices used for nasal irrigation become contaminated with organisms. Keen et al4 assessed 11 patients with persistent CRS despite maximal medical treatment and sinus surgery who were already using nasal irrigation bottles. At every two weeks for six weeks, patients were given new bottles and their previous bottles were swabbed to test for contamination which yielded a sample of 43 bottles. They found that 42/43 (97%) of bottles demonstrated bacterial growth. Foreman et al5 tested 20 bottles that were used for 1 week without cleaning in patients with stable CRS who had not undergone surgery within 6 months prior to the study. Out of the 20 bottles, bacterial growth was obtained from 19 (95%). In contrast, studies by Williams et al6 (29%), Welch et al3 (29%), and Lee et al7 (25%) all showed drastically lower rates of contamination. The low number of studies and differences in experiment methodology may account for the large range in contamination rate. The study conducted by Welch et al3 in particular may have had a low contamination rate due to the administration of antibiotics to all patients during the first 2 weeks of the study.\nIn previous studies of patients with CRS, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common bacteria isolated from the irrigation devices. The growth of these bacteria is not surprising with both commonly reported in the literature to be responsible for the majority of postoperative sinus infections.8 Keen et al4 demonstrated a contamination rate of 67% by S. aureus and 34% by p. aeruginoas. In contrast, there were very few cultures of S. aureus (1 of 20 bottles (5%)) from the bottles used by our patients with AR. Furthermore, p. aeruginosum was not cultured at all. Coagulase Negative Staph (CNS) was the most commonly cultured organism in this study (9 of 20 devices (45%)). It is unclear if this difference in species predominance is due to variations in potential colonizing bacteria in AR versus pathogenic bacteria in CRS.\nSeveral studies suggest that duration of use is associated with an increase in contamination rate. Welch et al3 noted an increase from 25% contamination to 45% contamination from week 2 to week 4. However, as noted previously, patients were initially given antibiotics during the study period and there was a 45% patient dropout rate between weeks 2 and 4, which may have influenced their results. In the study by Williams et al,6 6 bulb syringes were examined at weekly intervals for a total of 4 weeks. Although no bacterial contamination was noted after 7 d, bacteria were cultured at all other time points. Despite these supporting studies, Keen et al4 and Lewenza et al9 found that there was no significant correlation between contamination and duration of use. Our data did not reveal any increase in contamination rate from 4 weeks to 8 weeks.\nThe clinical implications of device contamination remain unclear. The study by Welch et al3 did not show a correlation between the bacteria isolated from sinus and irrigation bottles. The absence of clinical infections in patients with culture-positive bottles led them to conclude that irrigation bottle contamination did not affect clinical outcomes. The studies by Keen et al4 and Foreman et al5 did not support this since S. aureus was cultured concurrently in the sinonasal cavities and irrigation bottles of more than 80% of their patients. Furthermore, in the study by Keen et al,4 even after bottles were exchanged, growth of similar bacteria was seen in subsequent bottles, suggesting a dynamic transfer of bacteria between nose and bottle.These findings raise the possibility that contaminated irrigation bottles may prove to be a source of bacteria in postoperative sinus infections. Though all these studies were conducted with patients with CRS, it is possible that this transfer of bacteria occurs with devices used by AR patients as well. Given that none of our patients developed acute sinus infections, irrigation device contamination does not appear to have a significant effect on the outcomes of patients with AR and does not appear to be clinically relevant.\nReview of the literature shows a clear need for future well-designed research to more closely examine aspects of bottle contamination in the use of treatment of patients with AR specifically. Future studies should include patient cultures in order to determine the source and direction of contamination. If the bacterial strains of a specific species are identified to be the same from both the patient and the bottle, then the evidence for bacterial recycling becomes definitive. If not, then it is entirely possible that environmental contamination may be occurring.\nLimitations of this pilot study include the relatively small sample size, lack of patient cultures and varying severity of AR. The strengths of this study include a unique AR popu- lation without CRS, its prospective nature, no missing data, no drop-outs, and a diverse demographic of age and race. In addition, patients’ adherence to standardized bottle sterilization techniques were not formally surveyed. On follow up patients were questioned if they felt comfortable cleaning their device.\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that contamination of nasal irrigation devices occurs in patients with AR. The organisms identified as contaminants are different from those more commonly seen in CRS and the irrigation devices of patients with CRS. No correlation between length of device use and degree of contamination was found. No adverse clinical effect due to the contamination was noted.\nWe declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that can inappropriately influence our work, there is no professional or other personal interest of any nature or kind in any product, service and/or company that could be construed as influencing the content of this paper.\nThis study was funded by NeilMed® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Although a relatively low incidence of IPA is reported in patients with liver failure, this condition should be reconsidered as a devastating infectious disease in this population.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Early recognition of IPA and prompt antifungal treatment in patient with liver failure may improve the outcome. As noted previously, treatment with glucocorticoid (GC) is established to be a risk factor for IPA,通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> by inhibiting the antifungal immune responses of the host. Currently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommended voriconazole as the primary agent for treatment of IPA. However, voriconazole is hepatotoxic that is metabolized in the liver by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes, including CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u>, The CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism is related to plasma voriconazole concentration, which influence efficacy and safety of anti-fungal drugs.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> In addition, due to decreased hepatic metabolism of voriconazole in patients with liver dysfunction, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may increase the probability of a successful outcome, and potentially prevent unnecessary drug-related toxicity.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>\nHere, we report a case of IPA in a patient with liver failure who was successfully treated with voriconazole dependent on integrated application of CYP2C19 genotyping and TDM.\nThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical University, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients.\nA 63-year-old female was admitted to our hospital due to fever, cough, and viscous sputum. Thirty-four days previously, the patient developed acute liver failure with total bilirubin (TBIL) 337mmol/L and international normalized ratio (INR) 2.04 after using Chinese herbal medicine for osphyalgia. In an outside hospital, she received a 20-day course of methylprednisolone by intravenous-to-oral switch route at a gradually reduced daily dose. Liver function and coagulation profiles improved notably. However, the patient presented a new onset of fever with a maximum body temperature up to 38.8°C complicated with respiratory symptoms, such as cough and expectoration of brown-grey colored sputum. She was clinically diagnosed of IPA based upon on chest computed tomography (CT) films, as well as positive isolation of Aspergillus species in the sputum. Further, caspofungin (50 mg daily) and levofloxacin prophylaxis were prescribed for 7 days, but her symptoms did not alleviate. Therefore, she was transferred to the ward of Infectious Disease, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical University.\nOn admission, physical examination revealed evidence of generalized icterus. Moist crackles were detected on pulmonary auscultation. The laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell 3.36 × 109/L, neutrophils 2.39 × 109/L, lymphocytes 0.5 × 109/L, CD4+ T cells percentage 19.4%, platelets 44 × 109/L, alanine aminotransferase 92U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 55 U/L, TBIL 84.7 μmol/L, direct bilirubin 72.2 μmol/L, alkaline phosphatase 147U/L, glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 98U/L, and INR 1.7. Blood inflammatory markers were increased slightly: C-reactive protein 32.3 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 22 mm/h, and procalcitonin 0.39ng/mL. Serum 1,3-beta-D-glucan (BDG) test was positive (233.5pg/mL), but galactomannan (GM) test was negative. Thoracic CT scan revealed multifocal bilateral nodular infiltrates and ground glass opacities, in which cavities were also observed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>. The sputum specimens were sent for microbiologic tests. The Aspergillus fumigatus was detected by next-generation sequencing technology (8087 sequence reads) and fungal culture. Other pathogenic microorganisms were excluded.\nThe genotyping test for CYP2C19 alleles *2, *3, and *17 was performed. The patient carrying CYP2C19*1/*2 genotype was identified as intermediate metabolizer. Therefore, intravenous voriconazole was administrated as a loading dose of 200 mg every 12 hours on the first day, followed by maintenance dose of 100 mg every 12 hours 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>. However, she started to develop worsening skin rash 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>, vomiting, and altered state of consciousness following nearly 2days after initiation of voriconazole therapy. On the day 8, the TBIL and GGT levels increased to 179 μmol/L and 167U/L, respectively, while coagulation function was deteriorated again. None of the concomitant administered drugs, except voriconazole, appeared to be potentially hepatotoxic. TDM of the plasma voriconazole trough concentration (Cmin) was performed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography. The plasma Cmin was 16.76 mg/L, which is extremely higher than the recommended therapeutic range (0.5-5 mg/L) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Therefore, voriconazole was immediately discontinued, until its plasma Cmin reduced to 0.98 mg/L on the day 28 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>. After 16days of voriconazole discontinuation, symptoms of side effects gradually disappeared and the skin rash began to desquamate 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>, while the TBIL values declined to 64.2 μmol/L. Synchronously, the patient’s body temperature fell to the normal range during this period. On the day 27, a repeat chest CT scan showed that the pulmonary cavity in size was enlarged 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>. Under close monitoring, a single dose of voriconazole 100 mg was intravenously applied on the day 29. Plasma Cmin of voriconazole increased to 6.41 mg/L on the day 33, and then decreased to 1.22 mg/L on the day 40 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>. Considering high voriconazole concentration after intravenous infusion, the patient started to be treated with oral voriconazole tablet 200 mg every other day 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>. The body temperature and liver function parameters remained normal.\nOn the day 44, the latest results of chest CT scan showed obvious absorption with cavities and inflammation 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>. The patient discharged from the hospital with oral voriconazole tablet 200 mg daily, which was further used on an outpatient basis for 2 months until her recovery from infection. Plasma Cmin of voriconazole fluctuated between 1.5 and 3.2 mg/L 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>. The dynamic changes of laboratory parameters together with concentrations of voriconazole during treatment were depicted in Figure 2.\nIPA is traditionally regarded as a fatal opportunistic fungal infection that often occurs in immunocompromised patients, such as those with prolonged neutropenia, hematologic malignancies, or solid organ transplantation. It is remarkable that critically ill patients who have advanced liver diseases (cirrhosis or liver failure) are also reported to have increased risk for IPA, carrying a high mortality rate exceeding 70%. In a previous study, the mortality rate was 83% for patients with liver failure who developed IPA.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Thus, early diagnosis and therapy of IPA has been proposed to be a main determinant of outcome.\nGC is conditionally used for the early stage of liver failure by inhibiting excessive inflammation and immune responses. However, it is reported that prior GC therapy makes approximately 49.1% patients with liver failure more vulnerable to developing IPA.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Prolonged GC use (>7days) predisposes patients with liver failure to 18-fold higher risk for IPA.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> GC impairs the function of neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, even directly enhancing Aspergillus spp. growth, thereby favoring invasive infection. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that severe lymphopenia following methylprednisolone treatment may be a prominent host factor for IPA in this patient.\nTheoretically, both BDG test and GM test were positive in patients with IPA; however, inconsistent results were observed in this case. According to previous studies, the efficacy of the GM test in diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis indicates relatively lower sensitivity (71%) than its specificity (89%).通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Serum GM test of non-neutropenic patients has limited importance due to its lower sensitivity. If blood malignant patients were excluded from the cohort for analysis, the sensitivity of serum GM test may drop to 22%.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Although GM detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is superior to serum specimen for non-neutropenic population, increased risk of pulmonary hemorrhage may limit its use in patients with liver failure.\nTreatment of IPA is challenging in patients with severe liver diseases. Although voriconazole is recommended by IDSA as a first-line agent for IPA therapy, this drug displays potential hepatotoxicity that is related to its plasma concentration. Voriconazole is metabolized mainly in the liver by the polymorphic CYP2C19 enzymes.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Three different allelic variants including CYP2C19*2, *3, and *17 could explain most of the phenotypes associated with voriconazole metabolism.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u> A study demonstrated that more frequent CYP2C19*2 and *3 mutations were related to decreased enzyme activity and higher voriconazole concentration in the Chinese population.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Thus, patients with liver failure are particularly prone to hepatotoxicity due to abnormal hepatic metabolism of this drug. Since CYP2C19*1/*2 genotype associated with intermediate metabolism was observed in this patient, the dosage of voriconazole was reduced by one-half when initiating antifungal therapy.\nThere is a large body of evidence demonstrating that the plasma Cmin of voriconazole is closely associated with its efficacy and side effects. As a result, the TDM of voriconazole is recommended for patients with liver dysfunction, CYP2C19 mutations, concomitant drug interaction, poor clinical response, voriconazole adverse events, or life-threatening infection.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The Chinese Pharmacological Society recommends a rational therapeutic plasma Cmin of voriconazole between 0.5 and 5.0 μg/mL.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> A meta-analysis also showed that a voriconazole Cmin of 0.5 mg/L should be considered the lower threshold associated with efficacy.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> The Cmin > 3.0 mg/L is associated with increased hepatotoxicity, particularly for the Asian population, and > 4.0 mg/L is associated with increased neurotoxicity.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> In this case, a series of side effects, as a result of extremely high plasma Cmin (16.76 mg/L), occurred following 8- day treatment of voricona-zole. Although discontinuation of voriconazole for 14days, plasma concentration was still above the recommended upper threshold. Of note, a study demonstrated that both conventional dose and halved maintenance dose may be inappropriate in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh class B or C) due to high plasma concentration.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Thus, plasma concentration of voriconazole should be monitored earlier to avoid adverse effects.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Since both liver failure and cirrhosis display distinct pathophysiological characteristics, caution is advised for extrapolating these findings from patients with cirrhosis to those with liver failure. For example, restoration of liver function may alter pharmacokinet-ics of voriconazole. Therefore, dynamic TDM should be considered essential to guide dosage adjustment.\nIn conclusion, CYP2C19 genotyping combined with TDM will support individualization of voriconazole dosing for patients with severe liver disease, and potentially will minimize toxicity and maximize therapeutic efficacy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Bilateral vestibular schwannoma is the hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The NF2 gene has been cloned with comprehensive analysis of its mutations in schwannoma. However, most studies focused on vestibular schwannoma. There are differences in proliferation of tumor cell and ultrastructure between vestibular and spinal schwannomas. It is unknown whether genetic alterations in vestibular schwannoma are different from those in non-vestibular schwannoma. We analyzed the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 22 in patients with sporadic schwannoma including vestibular and spinal schwannomas and correlated this genetic alteration with tumor proliferation. Methods In 54 unrelated patients without clinical NF1 or NF2, 36 patients had sporadic vestibular schwannoma, and 18 dorsal spinal root schwannoma. Four highly polymorphic linkage to NF2 gene microsatellite DNA markers (D22S264, D22S268, D22S280, CRYB2) were used to analyze LOH. The proliferative index was evaluated by Ki-67 and proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining. Student's t test was used to analyze the difference of the proliferative index between schwannoma with LOH and that without LOH. The difference of the frequency of LOH in vestibular and spinal schwannomas was investigated by the chi-square test. Results Twenty-three schwannomas (42.6%, 23/54) showed allele loss. The frequency of LOH in vestibular schwannoma was significantly higher than that in spinal schwannoma (χ2=5.14, P&lt;0.05). The proliferative index of schwannoma with LOH was significantly higher than that without LOH (tki-67=2.97, P=0.0045; tPCNA=2.93, P=0.0051). Conclusions LOH on chromosome 22 is a frequent event in the tumorigenesis of sporadic schwannoma. And, there is a correlation between LOH on chromosome 22 and proliferative activity in schwannoma. The frequency of LOH in vestibular schwannoma is significantly different from that in spinal schwannoma。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Similarly, significant difference of Mtb-parasitic co-infection was also not observed across different age groups (χ2 = 36.238, df = 40 and P = 0.640).\nThe overall mean BMI of TB cases was 18.2 kg/m2. Among the study participants (50.0%, 192/384) had chronic energy deficiency, 34.6% (133/384) were normal and data was missing for 15.4% (59/384).

This might be due to the high risk of contact. Higher rate of infection in farmers and those who cannot read and write might be due to lack of awareness about the disease prevention, immediate diagnosis and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[13, 14]</u>.\nPrevalence of Mtb parasitic co-infection in this study (10.8%) is less than the recent co-infection rate (22%) reported from Addis Ababa 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. This is also true with the higher Mtb intestinal parasitic co-infection prevalence rate reported from other parts of Ethiopia in Gondar (33.3%) and Arba Minch (26.3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[13, 14]</u>. Such greater co-infection rate in other study sites of Ethiopia as compared to the recent finding might be due to the difference in geographical settings and the study participants. The age group of the study participants also vary in that only those whose age were 18 years and older were considered in this study whereas in the case of the former studies those who were younger than 18 were included. Studies in the country revealed that lower age groups possess higher parasitic infection than the older age groups 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. As there is no gold standard test for parasitic stool examination, differences in the testing mechanisms (direct saline, SAF and Kato-Katz) might also be another factor for the variations of TB parasitic co-infection since the sensitivity of one diagnostic method is different from the other 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>.\nSimilar to this study, findings in Arba Minch showed that the prevalence of intestinal helminth infections was greater (24.4%) than that of intestinal protozoa (6.1%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Comparable studies toward Mtb parasitic co-infection in northwestern Ethiopia also found 44.5 and 7.6% as the proportion of helminthic and protozoa infection, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Although helminthic infection is high in both of the study cases, their percentage varies as compared to this study which might be due to the difference in study subjects as well as the study sites. Contrary to the overall high prevalence of A. lumbericoides infection in the country, our finding showed S. mansoni to be the most widespread helminthic infections followed by A. lumbericoides. This is considered as due to high prevalence and endemicity of schistosomiasis in Oromia Special Zone specifically in Bati and Kemise areas of the study site 通用删除6(英):<u>[35, 36]</u>.\nAlthough there was no significant difference in parasitic co-infections among male and female study participants, males were infected in a greater proportion than females similar to the former finding in northwest Ethiopia 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. By contrast, a report from China showed that females are 2.05 times more likely to acquire IPIs than males 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. Such differences between Ethiopia and China might be due larger number of males than females in the former and the reverse in the later country.\nSeveral conditions including undernutrition, smoking, Diabetes mellitus and co-infections are important risk factors that aggravate the progress of TB 通用删除6(英):<u>[15, 16]</u>. To these effects, our assessments of nutritional status among TB cases using BMI showed about half of the cases were under chronic energy deficiency. Similar studies in other two areas of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: 39.7% and Arba Minch: 33.3%) found lower percentages as compared to this finding which might be due to the difference in time of taking the measurements 通用删除6(英):<u>[15, 38]</u>. In this study, measurements were taken on the spot of TB screening period when the patients’ body mass is expected to be low. However, the measurements of body mass were taken during the follow up of drug therapy both in Addis Ababa and Arba Minch study cases when their body mass might be improved due to the follow up treatments. In fact, studies in Ghana (51%) and urban Tanzania (56.8%) reported closer prevalence of undernutrition to this finding in Mtb parasitic co-infected patients. In all indicated studies, mild malnutrition was at its highest peak than moderate and severe malnutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>[38,39,40]</u>.\nThe higher percentage (58.6%) of undernutrition in Mtb parasitic co-infected cases in this study than parasite free TB cases (41.4%) could imply that co-infection had an impact on the nutritional status of TB cases. Measurements using MUAC also confirmed the findings of BMI in similar way that greater percentage of the TB cases with parasitic co-infection were undernourished than those of non-coinfected cases. Such greater rate of undernourishment in co-infected cases might be due to the parasitic impact. Similar finding of nutritional assessment using both BMI and MUAC parameter suggests co-infection have an impact on the nutritional status of TB cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[32, 41]</u>. In addition, implication of nutritional status difference among TB cases and the control group using both BMI and MUAC may be attributable to tuberculosis. This weight loss agrees with the clinical symptoms criteria for screening tuberculosis cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>.\nThe extent of EPTB in Ethiopia is much higher (33%) than the global average (15%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. This finding (25.3%) also agrees with the report which might be due to diagnostic challenges including shortage of pathologists to identify and treat the cases on time in most health institutions. There was no any pathologist to diagnose EPTB in all governmental health institutes including the referral hospital where this study was done. Because of this, all the suspected cases were referred to a single private diagnostic laboratory (BHDL) and remained as the diagnostic challenge of the area.\nThe overall LJ culture positivity was confirmed in 29.2% (112/384) which is close to the study in Addis Ababa (32.2%, n = 124) 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. On the contrary, the culture positivity of this study is much less than many studies whose findings were 95.9% (118/123), 87.9% (297/338), 53.5% (46/86) and 69.2% (63/91), respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[43,44,45,46]</u>. The less proportion of this study might be due to the delay of culturing time, electric interruption when the specimens were preserved in the refrigerator at the study sites and long distance travel from temporarily stored collection site to ALIPB where the specimens were cultured. These factors increase the chance of bacterial death in the collected sputum samples. Perhaps, it could also be our expectation that bacterial culture positivity might decrease as the sample stayed in the refrigerator for a long duration than immediate culturing.\nRegarding both pulmonary and EPTB culturing results, of 286 pulmonary and 98 extra-pulmonary smear positive specimens, 94 (32.8%) and 18 (18.4%) were culture positive, respectively. This proportion is less than that of a study in India who found 329 (61.5%) and 19 (29.2%) as culture positive for Mtb in both pulmonary and EPTB cases in that order 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>. A study from different study areas in Ethiopia also reported greater culture positivity of both clinically manifested smear positive pulmonary (79%, 756/953) and extra-pulmonary (38%, 456/1198) TB 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Similar studies in northwestern Ethiopia and Addis Ababa showed culture positivity of EPTB as 29.8 and 32.5%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[48, 49]</u>. In all instances, there is less culture positivity of EPTB than pulmonary ones which might be due to cytological suspicion of the specimen by pathologist unlike the detection of disease causative organism itself as in the case of PTB. Moreover, the suspected Mycobacteria cellular infection could be paucibacillary which decrease the sensitivity of diagnostic test in EPTB.\nThe EPTB has different manifestations based on the organs to be attacked and its intent of dissemination in the body. Similar to other relevant studies in the country, this finding also revealed that lymph nodes as the leading organs affected. In fact, the percentage of their infection rate differs as cervical, auxiliary, inguinal, supra-clavicular, sub-mandibular and anterior neck lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>[24, 49]</u>. This higher infection of lymph node is similar to the study reported from Germany 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>. On the other hand, the most common sites involved were the bone/joints and lymph nodes in United States of America 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>, whereas the genitourinary system and skin were the common sites of infection reported from Hong Kong 通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>. These differences may be attributable to either host or pathogen related factors as well as access to patient sample collection in the clinical settings.\nCervical lymph nodes were found as the most frequently infected anatomical site similar to other report from Ethiopia 通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u>. Such higher infection rate might be due to the physical proximity of lymph node to the route of infection where the bacilli can easily be picked up by macrophages or dendertic cells that facilitate the transportation of the bacilli in the cervical lymph nodes causing pathology. It could also be expected that the bacteria could easily spread from intra-thoracic lymphatics to the cervical areas. Limitations of this study include examination of a single faecal specimen, that faecal examination was not done for 32.5% of TB patients, that no sputum and faecal examination was done for the control groups and that a small number of participants fulfilled our matched criteria. All these might have a potential bias for the study and should be taken into consideration for future studies.\nIn the present study, there is relatively higher helminthic-TB co-infection than those of protozoa parasites. Most of the TB cases in the study were found as undernourished. The prevalence of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis was found as in a greater proportion with cervical lymphadenitis as the principal infection site. Thus, parasitic co-infections and nutritional status of tuberculosis cases should be further studied by treating the parasites and improving nutritional status of the co-infected patients.\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-019-0600-2.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1.

However, islet transplantation is hampered by issues such as immune rejection and shortage of donor islets. Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into insulin-producing cells. However, the potential of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (huMSCs) to become insulin-producing cells remains undetermined.Methods We isolated and induced cultured huMSCs under islet cell culture conditions. The response of huMSCs were monitored under an inverted phase contrast microscope. Immunocytochemical and immunofluorescence staining methods were used to measure insulin and glucagon protein levels. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect gene expression of human insulin and PDX-1. Dithizone-staining was employed to determine the zinc contents in huMSCs. Insulin secretion was also evaluated through radioimmunoassay.Results HuMSCs induced by nicotinamide and β-mercaptoethanol or by neurogenic differentiation 1 gene (NeuroD1)transfection gradually changed morphology from typically elongated fibroblast-shaped cells to round cells. They had a tendency to form clusters. Immunocytochemical studies showed positive expression of human insulin and glucagon in these cells in response to induction. RT-PCR experiments found that huMSCs expressed insulin and PDX-1 genes following induction and dithizone stained the cytoplasm of huMSCs a brownish red color after induction. Insulin secretion in induced huMSCs was significantly elevated compared with the control group (t=6.183, P＜0.05).Conclusions HuMSCs are able to differentiate into insulin-producing cells in vitro. The potential use of huMSCs in βcell replacement therapy of diabetes needs to be studied further。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Many experts believe that it is reliable to restore it with the traditional bone graft 3 to 6 months after the wound is healed because the early repair is apt to cause infection and easy to fail at the injured site. However, the wounded need to endure long-term psychological pressure and malfunction, need to undergo an operation again. Therefore, to reconstruct the defect early is a challenging task for us. According to the principle of the early repair, we designed the experiment. The firearm mandibular defects sustained by seventeen dogs were reconstructed early with a vascularized iliac graft and a free iliac graft so as to explore the feasibility of the procedure. The results showed that the delayed one-stage reconstruction could be used to repair the mandibular defect caused by firearm, using the vascularized bone graft.

This is somewhat surprising considering significant changes in the pattern of tobacco use - a known risk factor the development of many parotid neoplasms2 - over the past several decades. With this in mind, the goal of the present study was to investigate the distribution of parotid gland neoplasms among the US veteran population over the last two decades.\nThis study was approved by the Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) Institutional Review Board (IRB).\nThe electronic medical record (EMR) at the Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) was queried for patients who had undergone a fine needle aspiration (FNA) for a parotid gland mass between 2000 and 2018. Veterans were included if they were older than 18 years of age with no prior history of FNA. Of those patients included, medical records were reviewed for gender, age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), history of tobacco use, cytology results from the FNA, and if present, surgical pathology. Both surgical and non-surgical patients were included, and when available, surgical pathology superseded FNA cytology for final diagnosis.\nFor review of cytology, direct smears were air dried and stained with Diff-Quik and needles were rinsed in CytoLyt® processed using the ThinPrep method and stained by Papanicolaou stain. Cell blocks were also made from the needle rinse with the plasma-thrombin method and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All cases were reviewed by two board-certified pathologists and the vast majority of diagnoses were definite. When not definite, the final diagnosis was categorized as \"indeterminate\" .\nPatients with parotid metastases from anatomically distinct primaries, such as cutaneous malignancies, were excluded from the analysis. Tobacco use was categorized as never, former, and current and only those patients who smoked cigarettes were considered tobacco users. Former smokers were those who had a previous history of tobacco use, however had not used tobacco products for at least one year prior to FNA. Multicentric tumors of the same pathology were only counted once. For instance, a patient with two Warthin tumors was only documented as having one tumor. Only primary diagnoses were included in the analysis, therefore patients with tumor recurrence were only included for the primary tumor pathology.\nData aggregation was completed using Microsoft Excel 360 (Microsoft Corporation, Richmond, WA). All data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Means with standard deviations were used for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages were used for categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared by two sample t-test and ANOVA tests as appropriate, while categorical variables were compared by Chi-square and Fisher exact tests. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors which were associated with tumor type controlling for the variables which were found significant in the bivariate analysis. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05 and analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC).\nOne hundred and ninety-seven patients who underwent parotid gland FNA and/or parotidectomy for a solitary parotid lesion were included in the analysis. Of these, 56 (28.4%) were excluded due to non-neoplastic pathology, including benign cysts (n = 26), sialadenitis (n = 6), non-diagnostic/normal parotid tissue (n = 21), or due to metastatic nature (n = 3). Of the remaining 141 patients with parotid neoplasms, 122 (86.5%) were benign, 14 (9.9%) were malignant, and 5 (3.5%) were indeterminate . Of benign neoplasms, WT accounted for the majority at 51.6% (63/122), followed by PA at 40.2% (49/122), lipoma at 5.7% (7/122), basal cell adenoma at 1.6% (2/122), and myoepithelioma at 0.8% (1/122).\nDistribution of parotid neoplasms 通用删除7(英):<u>(2000-2018)</u>.\n删除重复语句：<u>Distribution of parotid neoplasms 通用删除7(英):<u>(2000-2018)</u>.</u>\na Non-diagnostic and normal FNAs excluded.\nb Metastatic lesions excluded.\nOf the 141 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 98 (69.5%) underwent surgery and 43 (30.5%) had FNA only. The discordance rate between FNA and surgical pathology for all tumors was 24.6%. A rate of 18.7% and 10.7% was observed for WT and PA respectively.\nThe clinical-demographic data among patients with WT and PA is depicted in Table 3. In our bivariate model, gender, age, and tobacco use were found to be statistically significant. A greater proportion of WT patients were male, compared to PA patients (93.7% vs. 77.6%, P = 0.0228). In addition, WT patients were significantly older than those with PA (66.8 ± 9.4 vs. 60.0 ± 12.9, P = 0.0018). Of patients with WT, 82.5% were former or current smokers, compared to 65.3% among patients with PA (P = 0.0106). Of note, after controlling for co-variates, only current tobacco use and age were found to be statistically significant. The odds of WT for current smokers was 3.7 times higher compared to never smokers after controlling for age and gender (3.744, 95%CI = 1.27-11.02, P = 0.0162). The odds of WT increased by 6.2% for a unit increase in age after controlling for gender and smoking status (1.062, 95% CI = 1.01-1.11, P = 0.0078).\nCharacteristics of benign parotid neoplasms 通用删除7(英):<u>(2000-2018)</u>.\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of benign parotid neoplasms 通用删除7(英):<u>(2000-2018)</u>.</u>\nWhen stratified by decade (2000-2009 and 2010-2018), differences in gender, age at diagnosis, race and BMI among all comers undergoing FNA were not significant. Between the two decades, the proportion of WT increased from 31.6% to 53.6%, whereas the proportion of PA slightly decreased from 36.8% to 33.3%, respectively . The incidence of WT increased significantly over the last two decades (P = 0.0422), whereas the incidence of other neoplasms remained stable . Malignant neoplasms decreased in incidence over the same time period from 14.0% to 7.1% .\nThe proportion of former, current, and never smokers was also analyzed amongst all patients across four time periods . Of note, the former and current smoking rates did not significantly change over time (P = 0.3460). The overall rate of current smokers across all decades was 32.0%.\nA number of European studies have suggested a shifting paradigm in the once well-established epidemiology of benign parotid neoplasms, with an increasing incidence of WT compared to PA.2,6,8,9 Franzen et al8 showed a higher frequency of WT compared to PA, seen in the final decade of a 42-year long analysis in a rural German population from 1975 to 2017. Various other European studies have reported similar trends. Luers et al6 reported an increase in WT from 24% to 48% from 1990 to 2014, while Kadletz et al9 reported an increased rate of 10%-60% from 1960 to 2015. Of note, the latter study described a six-fold increase in WT incidence discordant with relatively stable smoking rates - a known risk factor for the development of WT.9,10 To our knowledge, the present investigation is the first North American study to describe the incidence of benign salivary neoplasms in several decades, as well as the first to report an overall higher incidence of WT compared to PA, which is classically considered the most common benign parotid neoplasm.\nOverall, several factors may explain this apparent increase in incidence of WT. Examining risk factors for the development of WT, such as tobacco exposure, may shed some light. Once a widespread habit in the United States in the 20th century, tobacco use reached its height in 1953, with a national smoking rate of 47%,11 and has since declined. Given that the median age of patients with WT in our cohort was 66.9, increased incidence may be an artifact of widespread smoking habits during the last several decades.\nAlthough the national smoking rate has recently declined, the U.S. veteran population has historically maintained a higher than average smoking rate.12 This observation is further corroborated by our results, which may partly account for a high incidence of WT in our cohort. However, the steady former and current smoking rate in our cohort does not explain the rising incidence of WT that we observed.\nObesity is another factor that has been implicated in the rising incidence of WT identified by European investigators.9 Among our cohort, however, there was no association between BMI and developing a WT. Furthermore, there was no difference in BMI among the two decades. It is possible that the effect of obesity on our cohort was not apparent due to the small sample size.\nThe rise in benign neoplasms which was observed in our cohort may be partly explained by the routine use of imaging modalities that identify small and asymptomatic parotid neoplasms. Recent studies have demonstrated a 60% overall increase in computed tomography (CT) scans utilized in the emergency room setting over the last decade, which may be responsible for incidentally noted parotid lesions, leading to further evaluation and subsequent FNA.13 However, this alone does not explain the rise in benign neoplasms and decline in malignant neoplasms in our veteran cohort.\nAside from its retrospective nature and limited sample size, a number of limitations must be considered. Of note, the percentage of patients undergoing FNA for parotid lesions is largely unknown. It is entirely possible, that the number of FNAs ordered or the compliance rate of patients completing FNAs has changed over the last two decades. An increase in the number of FNAs could explain a variance in frequencies of certain parotid pathologies. An investigation on the ordering practices of clinicians could be an avenue for future studies.\nIn addition, another limitation of our study is that limited data was available to compare the health of patient populations across decades. Although there was no difference among age, BMI, and smoking rates, overall cardiovascular and pulmonary status, as well as presence of diabetes may have influenced a patient’s ability to undergo parotidectomy, possibly alerting true incidence of certain parotid pathologies.\nFinally, as with many other studies which examine epidemiologic data on incidence and distribution of benign parotid neoplasms, the majority of information is derived from single institutions, with population-based studies less common.8 As a result, our findings may not be relatable to the general US population. Nonetheless, our results suggest a shift in the distribution of parotid gland neoplasms in the veteran population of North America.\nIn our veteran cohort who underwent FNA for parotid gland masses, Warthin tumor was the most common benign neoplasm encountered, surpassing pleomorphic adenomas in incidence. Furthermore, our results suggest that the incidence of Warthin tumor is increasing, despite relatively stable smoking rates. It remains unclear whether this is due to a higher prevalence of tobacco use or male gender among the veteran population. However, a thorough understanding of the distribution of parotid gland neoplasms in this specific population is critical to patient counseling and surgical planning. This study contributes to the demographic epidemiology of salivary gland tumors and demonstrates the shifting distribution of parotid gland neoplasms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

It was reported that ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure solved the problems of fetal airway or pulmonary lesion during delivery to avoid hypoxia after birth.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The goal of EXIT is to maintain placental circulation while steps are taken to optimize the transition of the baby from fetal to neonatal life. This study introduced the experience of EXIT procedure to solve the problems of fetal circulation induced by a fetal cardiac tumor.\nA 32-year-old healthy pregnant woman with more than 30 gestational weeks was admitted to the hospital due to the fetal cardiac mass. The fetal echocardiography showed a heterogeneous lesion of 2.85 cm × 2.25 cm on the right side of the heart, which compressed the tricuspid annulus by 50% with pericardial effusion 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u>. It was difficult to distinguish the source of fetal cardiac mass either within the heart or in the pericardial cavity by fetal echocardiography. The fetus was at risk when the fetal heart rate decreased to less than 80 bpm and pericardial effusion continued to increase during the hospitalization. The EXIT procedure was performed to resect fetal cardiac tumor if it was located in the pericardial cavity or to ameliorate cardiac compression and bradycardia by pericardial effusion drainage.\nThe cesarean section was performed, and the uterine relaxation was attained with the inhalation of a high dose of sevoflurane (5–10%). The fetus was released from the uterus, and the placental circulation was kept intact. The fetal heart was exposed through the median sternotomy. The mass was located within the right atrium and hence could not be quickly removed without cardiopulmonary bypass. Therefore, about 30 ml of pericardial effusion was drained, and the skin was just sutured without closing the sternum to release the space for the cardiac mass. The tricuspid annulus compression was ameliorated as demonstrated by fetal echocardiography 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b]</u>. The fetus delivered weighed 2.2 kg and had a sinus rhythm of 130–150 bpm. The cesarean section was completed with the administration of oxytocin and termination of sevoflurane inhalation after fetal delivery. The pregnant woman recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the 5th day postoperatively.\nThe neonate was intubated with mechanical respiratory support, and his heart function was still impaired by the cardiac mass compression. Dopamine was administered at a rate of 10 µg·kg−1·min−1 to maintain the mean blood pressure ranging from 40 to 50 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). Therefore, cardiac tumor resection was performed under the cardiopulmonary bypass on the 2nd day after birth 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1c]</u>. The pathological examination demonstrated the diagnosis of cardiac hemangioma. The neonate recovered well and was discharged after 1 month with 2.75 kg weight. No evidence of cardiac tumor recurrence was reported after a follow-up of 10 months.\nRhabdomyoma was the most common lesion in the fetal heart, and fetal cardiac hemangioma was extremely rare.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The therapeutic strategy and the interventional timing for fetal cardiac tumor depended on the influence of lesions on fetal cardiac function, complicated inherited metabolic disease, and gestational weeks. The nonimmune fetal edema and (or) reduced fetal heart rate were indications for fetal cardiac intervention.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> If the lesion was complicated only with a large amount of pericardial effusion, the fetal pericardio-amniotic shunting could be made to release the cardiac compression.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> However, 50% compression of the tricuspid annulus and pericardial effusion might restrict blood flow into the right ventricle and could not be solved by pericardio-amniotic shunting. Fetal bradycardia occurred due to the atrioventricular node compression. It was at high risk for the fetus in the womb and also dangerous for the transition from the fetal circulation to the postnatal circulation after delivery.\nThe EXIT procedure was performed to rescue the fetus at 32 gestational weeks. An effort was made to resect the cardiac tumor assuming it was in the pericardial cavity. However, the fetal cardiac tumor was located within the right atrium. It could not be resected because fetal cardiopulmonary bypass was not safe for both the mother and the fetus. Therefore, the cardiac compression was relieved by pericardial effusion drainage and delayed sternal closure. The fetus was delivered without marked circulatory instability, and the sinus rhythm was recovered after fetal cardiac decompression. The result demonstrated that fetal cardiac intervention was possible with the EXIT procedure to ameliorate the cardiac compression induced by the cardiac tumor. The therapeutic strategy for this fetal cardiac tumor expanded the indications of EXIT procedure.\nThe authors certify that they have obtained the appropriate patient's parents agreement.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this technique with cholangioduodenostomy in dog model.Methods A patent intraluminal degradable stent tube for sutureless choledochoduodenostomy in dog model was made with polylactic acid in diameter of 3 mm or 4 mm. Thirty-eight dogs were randomly divided into to a stent group (SG, n=20) and a control group (CG, n=18). Dogs in the SG underwent sutureless choledochoduodenostomy with intraluminal stent, while the CG underwent conventional choledochoduodenostomy (single layer discontinuous anastomosis with absorbable suture). Dogs of each group were divided into 4 subgroups according to time of death (1,3,6, and 12 months postoperatively) to evaluate the healing of anastomosis. Operation time, intraoperative tolerance pressure of anastomosis, rate of postoperative bile leakage, bursting pressure of anastomosis were compared between the two groups. Anastomosis tissue was observed afterwards by pathology evaluation, hydroxyproline content, serum bilirubin, liver enzyme level and magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) to assess the stricture.Results All procedures were completed successfully. The surgical time of the SG was significantly less than the CG (SG: (19.2±4.3) minutes, vs. CG: (29.2±7.1) minutes, P=0.000). One bile leakage was occurred in either group. No significant difference of intraoperative tolerance pressure of anastomosis, rate of bile leakage and postoperative bursting pressure of anastomosis, anastomotic stricture, hydroxyproline content, serum bilirubin and liver enzyme level was found between the two groups.

A model control group received water without DSS. As shown in Figure 1A, mice in the DSS group showed significant weight loss compared with the control mice, but the baicalein group showed a dose-dependent and significant reduction in body weight loss compared with the DSS group. The mean colon length of DSS-treated mice was significantly shorter than that of the control mice (P < 0.01, t = 8.35), and baicalein treatment (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) also reversed the colon shortening (P < 0.05, t= 2.51; P < 0.05, t= 2.62, and P < 0.01, t= 3.27, respectively) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B and Figure 1C]</u>. In addition, baicalein at 20 and 40 mg/kg reduced the splenomegaly caused by DSS treatment (P < 0.01, t= 3.40 and P < 0.01, t = 4.10, respectively) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1D]</u>. Pathological examination of colon sections indicated that DSS treatment induced severe mucosal necrosis accompanied by extensive inflammatory cell infiltration, congestion, and edema of the submucosa. This colonic damage was significantly reduced by baicalein treatment in a dose-dependent manner, with a concomitant reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1E]</u>. The overall disease activity of DSS-treated mice, as measured by the DAI, was also reduced by baicalein treatment, consistent with the amelioration of colonic damage 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1F]</u>.\nCompared with the water-treated mice, baicalein at 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg significantly reduced the DSS-induced increase in serum IL-6 and IL-1β levels (IL-6: P < 0.01, t= 17.90; P < 0.01, t= 5.78; and P < 0.01, t= 5.98, respectively; IL-1β: P < 0.01, t= 6.05; P < 0.01, t= 16.86; and P < 0.01, t= 17.13, respectively) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A]</u>. In addition, baicalein reduced the number of IL-6-positive, IL-1β-positive, and TNF-α-positive cells in the colonic mucosa of DSS-treated mice 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2B]</u>.\nTo further evaluate the protective effect of baicalein on DSS-induced colitis, we measured inflammatory cell infiltration by IHC staining of colon sections for CD11b+, which is expressed on many leukocytes, including monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, granulocytes, and macrophages. As shown in Figure 3, a large number of CD11b+ cells were observed in the lesional mucosa of colons from DSS/water-treated mice, but the cell abundance was dramatically reduced by baicalein treatment. Moreover, baicalein also attenuated the expression of the transcription factor RORγt, which is pivotal in the development of proinflammatory Th17 cells 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>.\nNucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor expressed in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells in the intestinal epithelium and plays a key role in stimulating the host immune response.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u> Western blot analysis of colon extracts showed that NOD2 expression was increased by DSS treatment, while baicalein significantly inhibited its expression compared with the DSS/water group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5A and Figure 5B]</u>.\nAs noted, enzymes that control S1P levels (including SHPK1 and SPHK2) are consistently dysregulated in animal models of IBD and in human colonic tissues.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> IHC analysis of colon sections from DSS-treated mice revealed large numbers of SPHK1- and p-STAT3-positive cells, but their abundance was significantly reduced by baicalein treatment at 40 mg/kg 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6A]</u>. In addition, western blot analysis confirmed that baicalein at 40 mg/kg significantly inhibited DSS-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and reversed the over-expression of SPHK1 and S1PR1 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6B and Figure 6C]</u>. However, the expression of total STAT3 was not changed by baicalein treatment 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6B]</u>. These results indicate that baicalein exerts its anti-colitic effects through the inhibition of SPHK1 expression and STAT3 activation.\nThe results of this study demonstrated that mice treated with DSS exhibited weight loss, colon shortening, and colon tissue damage accompanied by extensive inflammatory cell infiltration. However, these effects were significantly reduced by treatment with baicalein in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the DSS-induced increase in serum IL-6 and IL-1β and colonic IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were reduced by baicalein treatment, as was the expression of the Th17 cell transcription factor RORγt in the colon.\nStudies to date have shown that baicalein exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activity with little to no toxicity in animals and humans.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Kim et al通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> demonstrated that baicalein inhibits the production of various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors by the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line. In a mouse model, baicalein reduced acute pancreatitis-associated inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB, MAPK, and STAT3 signaling pathways.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Although baicalein has been reported to have anti-colitic activity,通用删除6(英):<u>[5,19]</u> the precise anti-inflammatory mechanisms were not clear. Here, we employed the well-characterized DSS model with 5ASA, which has established efficacy in preventing colitis in animal models,通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> as a positive control to compare with the effects of baicalein.\nNOD2 plays an important role in inflammation and associated carcinogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24,29]</u> After binding of muramyl dipeptide, a molecule produced by all bacteria, NOD2 promotes the production of proinflammatory factors, such as cytokines and chemokines, by increasing expression of MAPK and NF-κB.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> In the present study, we found that NOD2 was expressed at higher levels in the model control group (no DSS) than the DSS/water group, indicating that DSS suppresses NOD2 expression. However, baicalein further inhibited NOD2 expression, consistent with the inhibition of colitis symptoms.\nS1P is known to play an important role in inflammatory diseases, especially IBD.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> SPHK1 and SPHK2 are expressed at low levels in healthy colon tissues, but SPHK1 is up-regulated and activated during inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Expression of SPHK1 in the colonic epithelium is required for autocrine induction of cyclo-oxygenase 2 during DSS-induced colitis, and SPHK1 is also over-expressed in colitis-related cancers.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> STAT3 has important functions in the induction and progression of IBD. Lovato et al通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> found that STAT3 is constitutively activated in intestinal T cells isolated from patients with Crohn’s disease, but not from healthy volunteers. It has been demonstrated that p-STAT3 expression is restricted to areas of active inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35]</u> STAT3 mediates the transcription of numerous genes involved in colitis and inflammation-related cancers.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> S1P mediates the activation of STAT3, which is crucial to the development of IBD -associated colorectal cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> Conversely, STAT3 can regulate the concentration of S1P levels to some extent.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,36,37]</u> These observations point to a reciprocal stimulatory relationship between S1P and STAT3 in promoting carcinogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> In the present study, we showed that baicalein significantly inhibited the DSS-induced increase in SPHK1 and p-STAT3 expression in the colon, providing a potential mechanism for the protective effect of baicalein in DSS-induced colitis. Although we found that baicalein also reduced RORγt expression in the colon, we did not investigate the presence of Th17 cells. Such analyses are planned for future studies. We also plan to further explore the anti-inflammatory mechanism of baicalein using RNA interference-mediated inhibition of S1PR1 and STAT3 expression.\nIBD pathogenesis is caused by an imbalance between microflora and intestinal mucosal integrity and barrier function. Patients with this disease not only suffer seriously reduced quality of life but also have a greatly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[31,38]</u> Standard IBD treatments, including steroids, other immunosuppressants, aminosalicylate, and antibiotics, are not always effective, and many refractory cases require surgery, albeit often with unsatisfactory efficacy and safety outcomes. In this study, we found that baicalein improved DSS-induced weight loss, colonic congestion and edema, splenomegaly, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and the accompanying colonic and systemic inflammation, suggesting that this flavonoid might be beneficial for the treatment of colitis in humans. However, further studies will be necessary to evaluate the safety of baicalein in clinical applications and to optimize its beneficial effects in patients.\nThis work was supported by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81603143, 21807041), Shandong Medical and Health Science and Technology Development Project (Nos. 2017WS646, 2017WS653), Teachers’ Research Support Fund of Jining Medical University 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. JYFC2018KJ037)</u>, and National Natural Science Foundation Breeding Programs of Jining Medical University 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. JYP201708)</u>.\nNone.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

MCE was performed after a bolus injection of FCT-188 (0.025 ml/kg, Ⅳ) into a superficial vein of the forelimb at baseline, 20 minutes after occlusion, and 4 h after reperfusion to non-invasively assess the left ventricular myocardium area (LVMA), myocardial ischemic risk area (RA), and infarct area (IA) in a short-axis view of left ventricle. The accuracy of detecting myocardial perfusion with intravenous MCE was further assessed by in vitro myocardial staining of the matched cross-sections. Both RA and IA were expressed as percent of LVMA.RESULTSLVMA, RA, IA, and IA/RA ratio were accurately assessed by MCE (LVMA: 6.60 cm2±0.76 cm2; RA: 35.7%±6.68%; IA: 21.0%±13.2%; IA/RA: 60.3%±31.4%; n=7) as compared with those of the matched cross-section (LVMA: 6.81 cm2±0.73 cm2, P=0.062; RA: 35.3%±9.9%, P=0.84; IA: 25.10%±14.5%, P=0.07; IA/RA: 68.0%±22.2%, P=0.28, respectively).

Despite extensive studies and improvements in critical care, the occurrence rate of POP in aSAH continue to be high, and may affect up to 13% to 37% of patients after surgical treatment, and is still difficult to predict.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4,5]</u>\nThe aSAH patients with POP had worse outcomes than those without, both during hospitalization and after discharge.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Many risk factors for POP have been studied (eg, age, the severity of aSAH, ventilator use, congestive heart failure, etc),通用删除6(英):<u>[4,7,8,9]</u> but the clinical predictive model has still not been well established. The severity of aSAH is well known to be associated with POP. However, early prediction of the risk of POP may facilitate optimized care; therefore, finding a readily measurable marker for POP in patients with aSAH would be helpful for early prognostication and risk stratification, and may provide clues for further studies about preventive antibiotic therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nThe neutrophil to leukocyte ratio (NLR), is a well-known marker for inflammation condition of patients, has been shown to be a predictor of clinical prognosis in patients with ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, and a predictor for poor prognosis of aSAH, stroke-associated pneumonia in acute ischemic stroke patients and community-acquired pneumonia.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13,14]</u> However, the connection between NLR and POP following aSAH is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using NLR to predict pneumonia after clipping or coiling of the aneurysm in patients with aSAH.\nThis study was designed in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Informed consent for each patient was obtained from the patients or their authorized legal representative if patients cannot sign the form by themselves.\nPatients with aSAH administrated between January 2013 and June 2018 to the Department of Neurosurgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University were prospectively enrolled into a prospective, observational cohort, aSAH outcomes project study. In the current study, data of patients in this prospective cohort were retrospectively analyzed.\nThe inclusion criteria were: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the SAH caused by intracranial aneurysm was confirmed via computed tomography angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA); 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> had admission blood cell counts data; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> admitted to our hospital within seven days of symptom onset; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> clipping or coiling of the aneurysm was performed.

The location and size of the aneurysm was determined via CTA or DSA. The modified Fisher scale was used to classify the amount of subarachnoid blood presented on the admission computed tomography (CT) scan.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> The severity of aSAH was assessed based on the initial World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade. Medical data of each patient were assessed by two doctors to obtain the initial WFNS grade. If a large deviation in the modified Fisher scale or WFNS grade was seen, the final score would be given by a third doctor. The above assessment is completed within 24 h of admission.\nAs part of the routine patient care procedure, white blood cell (WBC) differential count at admission was obtained for each patient. The NLR was calculated as neutrophil count divided by lymphocyte count. Researchers who collected blood cell counts data were blinded to patient details. The laboratory examination of admission is completed within 48 h after admission.\nThe diagnosis of POP was re-conducted by two researchers (a neurosurgeon and a neuro critical care physician, both with extensive clinical experience) who were blinded to other clinical and laboratory findings. Patients were diagnosed with POP if they developed lower respiratory tract infections within 30 days after surgical treatment according to the modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> The modified CDC criteria: possible POP meet the CDC diagnosis criteria, but could not be diagnosed based on the admission or follow-up chest X-ray, without other possible diagnosis or explanation; for confirmed POP is: meet all CDC diagnosis criteria and had a confirmed diagnostic change on at least one of the chest X-ray images. In the current study, both possible and confirmed pneumonia as determined by the modified CDC criteria were considered as pneumonia.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,20]</u> Any patients who were overtly diagnosed with pneumonia before admission were excluded.\nIn this study, good-grade was defined as admission WFNS Grade <3, whereas poor-grade was defined as WFNS Grade ≥3.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>\nPatients began recording their lungs immediately after surgery. During the patient’s post-operative hospitalization, the patient’s lung condition was recorded during daily room visits by asking for a medical history and physical examination assessment. If symptoms of suspected lung infection are present, further refine the appropriate laboratory tests for the lung CT scan. For patients who have been discharged within 30 days, they are asked to return to the hospital again for a review at 30 days post-operatively, asking about their lung condition from the time of discharge to the time of the review, and about their lung condition at the time of the review. The endpoint of follow-up was the presence of POP or 30 days post-operatively.\nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and R statistical software 通用删除1(英):<u>(R, version 3.6.3, R Project, www.r-project.org)</u>. Continuous variables were shown as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed by 2-sample t test. Categorical variables were expressed as counts (percentage) and analyzed with the Pearson χ2 test or Fisher exact test. The candidate pool of multivariate predictors included all available demographics and baseline variables that had univariate association P < 0.10 with the occurrence of POP. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of risk factors. Use multivariate survival analysis to generate multivariate models. Candidate predictors include all the single factor variables selected above. The backward stepwise regression method was used to generate the final model, thereby removing the least important variables from Model 1 at a time until P < 0.05 for all remaining variables. The percentage of patients surviving POP for 30 days after surgical treatment was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method, the survival curves were drawn and compared using the log-rank test. P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Interaction tests were conducted between all important variables retained in the multivariable model.\nA total of 711 patients were included in this study and categorized into POP group (n = 219) and non-POP group (n = 492), the average age of patients was 55.13 ± 11.30 years, with 61.32% (436/711) being female. Patient demographics and baseline medical characteristics were compared between the two groups and the results are shown in Table 1.

In univariate analysis, the use of the ventilator is converted into orderly multi-classification data according to the mechanical ventilation time (0-24, 24-48, 48-72, more than 72 h) for analysis. In a sub-group analysis at the NLR level, whether the mechanical ventilation time is greater than 24 h will convert the ventilator usage into a binary variable.\nMoreover, patients in the high NLR group had higher WFNS grade, modified Fisher scale, rate of ventilator use, WBC count, neutrophil count, and lower lymphocyte count than those in the low NLR group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.\nAneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients' demographics and baseline characteristics by the NLR value.\n删除重复语句：<u>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients' demographics and baseline characteristics by the NLR value.</u>\nValues are expressed as n, n (%), mean ± standard deviation, or median (interquartile range). *F value for normally distributed numeral variables. †χ2 value for categorical variables.

The majority had bacterial infection (n = 94), with Streptococcus pneumoniae (27.7%, 26/94) being the most common cause, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (18.8%, 18/94), Staphylococcus aureus (18.1%, 17/94), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.8%, 13/86); of the 13 fungal infection cases, the most commonly seen fungi was Candida albicans (46.2%, 6/13).\n219 patients (30.80%) experienced POP within one month after clipping or endovascular treatment of aneurysm. Eleven variables, including the age, WFNS grade, modified Fisher scale, hypertension, endovascular treatment, mechanical ventilator use >24 h, WBC count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, NLR, and WFNS grade × NLR had univariate associations P < 0.10 with the occurrence of POP 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u> and were put into multivariate model analyses.\nMultivariate survival analysis models showed that the risk of POP was significantly associated with age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.042, 95% CI: 1.029-1.056, P < 0.001), WFNS grade (HR: 2.166, 95% CI: 1.496-3.137, P < 0.001), modified Fisher scale (HR: 1.320, 95% CI: 1.133-1.539, P < 0.001), endovascular treatment (HR: 0.500, 95% CI: 0.338-0.739, P = 0.001), NLR (HR: 1.045, 95% CI: 1.026-1.064, P < 0.001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>.\nMultivariate model analysis of possible predictors of POP.\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate model analysis of possible predictors of POP.</u>\nMultivariate analysis: all variables in Table 1 having P < 0.05 were included in multivariate analysis. †Backward stepwise regression methods were used to produce the final model, in which process the least nonsignificant variable was removed from the model 1 at a time until all remaining variables had P < 0.05. POP: Post-operative pneumonia; NLR: Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio; WFNS: World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies.\nIn addition, although the mechanical ventilation index was eliminated from the multivariate survival analysis model, in view of its clinical significance, we still conducted a subgroup analysis. When the patients were groups into mechanical ventilator used >24 and 0 to 24 h groups, sub-group analysis reveal that NLR was still related to POP. In the mechanical ventilator used >24 h group (n = 130), POP occurred in 110 patients (84.62%), and the average NLR of these patients was significantly higher than that of the 20 patients without POP (14.20 ± 7.42 vs. 10.05 ± 6.68, P = 0.021); For non-mechanical ventilation or mechanical ventilator used 0 to 24 h patients (n = 581), POP occurred in 109 patients (18.76%), and the average NLR of these patients was also significantly higher than those without POP (12.48 ± 7.36 vs. 8.44 ± 5.51, P < 0.001).\nThrough the analysis of receiver operating curve 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>, the comparison between NLR and classic forecast indicators can be found that the NLR’s POP prediction effect is better than WBC (Z = 2.636, P = 0.008), which is equivalent to WFNS (Z = 1.052, P = 0.293). Additionally, we found a significant interaction between the WFNS level and NLR. The area under curve (AUC) of NLR was significantly increased after the WFNS grade was combined with the NLR (Z = 2.552, P = 0.011).\nBased on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the best threshold for NLR in predicting POP was 10.04. Patients with admission NLR >10 (n = 285) had significantly higher incidence of POP than patients with admission NLR ≤10 (n = 426) (40.00% [114/285] vs. 24.65% [105/426], P < 0.001).\nKaplan-Meier analysis showed that among good-grade patients (WFNS Grade <3, n = 564), 176 patients (31.21%) had admission NLR >10. Post-hoc log-rank testing revealed good-grade patients with admission NLR >10 had significantly worse POP survival rate than good-grade patients with NLR ≤10 (85.05% [330/388] vs. 69.32% [122/176], P < 0.001). Among poor-grade patients (WFNS Grade ≥3, n = 147), 108 of them (73.47%) had admission NLR >10. Post-hoc log-rank testing revealed that poor-grade patients having admission NLR >10 had significantly worse POP survival rate than poor-grade patients having NLR ≤10 (43.59% [17/39] vs. 21.30% [23/108], P = 0.014). Moreover, the POP survival rate of good-grade patients with admission NLR >10 was still better than that of poor-grade patients with NLR ≤10 (P = 0.002) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nIn this study, we found that higher NLR was associated with POP in aSAH patients. After adjusting for confounders, multivariate analysis revealed that NLR remained a significant factor associated with the POP. NLR, which could be easily obtained from blood cell counts, might be a strong complete blood count panel predictor of POP and outperform many classic predictors of POP, including WBC, hypertension, and smoking.\nPOP is a common and severe complication usually occurs within 30 days after surgical treatment of aSAH patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,22]</u> Based on the study investigating the relationship between severity of SAH and POP, assessing the WFNS grade could be helpful in the prediction of POP.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> However, finding a readily measurable marker for predicting POP would still be helpful for early prognosis and risk stratification.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Current data demonstrated that the predictive performances of NLR and WFNS grade were comparable (Z = 1.194, P = 0.233). The WBC differential count is routinely collected for aSAH patients. Therefore NLR, derived from the WBC differential count is easy to obtain and calculate, without adding extra cost, and is potentially a simple way for clinicians to determine the POP risk for patients. Moreover, we also found an additive interaction between WFNS grade and NLR. Multivariate analysis revealed that NLR and WFNS grade × NLR remained the significant factors associated with POP following aSAH after adjusting for possible confounding factors, including the age, WFNS grade, endovascular treatment, and ventilator use. The AUC of NLR was significantly increased after the WFNS grade was combined with the NLR (P < 0.05).\nIn this study of 711 aSAH patients, approximately 40% of all patients, 30% of good-grade patients, and 70% of poor-grade patients had admission NLR >10. Patients having admission NLR >10 had significantly worse POP survival rate than patients having NLR ≤10. However, this effect was limited to patients with the same admission clinical grade. POP survival rate of good-grade patients having admission NLR >10 was still significantly worse than that of poor-grade patients having NLR ≤10.\nThe aSAH patients with POP might have a prolonged clinical course, early prognosis of this cohort will enable physicians to discuss expected clinical course of disease with the family members and make informed decisions on treatment options. In the current study, ROC curve analysis revealed that the best threshold of NLR for predicting POP of aSAH patients was 10.04, and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity was 63.5% and 70.7%, respectively. For the patients with elevated NLR, pre-operative education and strengthen respiratory tract management is suggested. For example: pre-operative education (smoking cessation, deep breathing exercise to improve respiratory function, clean the mouth), adjustment of the diet structure to strengthen nutrition, atomization to alleviate bronchospasm. However, this approach needs to be confirmed with further research.\nThere may be several possible explanations for the potential connection between the NLR and POP. One may be the immunologic changes after aSAH. It has been reported that between 63% to 88% of aSAH patients could develop early systemic inflammatory response,通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24,25]</u> which is altered through the sympathetic pathway and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u> As a result, neutrophils are demarginated and stimulated by growth factors通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13,28]</u>; however, lymphocytes undergo apoptosis, which may increase the susceptibility to infection. Second, the severity of aSAH could also be related to NLR and POP. In our cohort, the higher NLR group had a higher initial WFNS grade. Previous studies have also shown that POP has a close relationship with severe aSAH.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u> Thus, the NLR might act as a marker for severe aSAH patients who are vulnerable to POP. Third, the NLR may be a simple marker of sub-clinical infection. Although we excluded pneumonia events detected before admission, an elevated NLR may indicate an underlying inflammatory process associated with POP.\nWe transformed NLR variables into bicategorical information and divided them into a high NLR level group and a low NLR level group and performed a confounding factor analysis, which showed that patients in the high NLR group may have worse baseline information than those in the low NLR group (this may be due to the fact that elevated NLR corresponds to an active phase of inflammatory response in this group), but there was no significant difference in clinical management between the two groups. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the information of the two groups of patients remains comparable. In addition, NLR levels were higher in the POP group than those in the non-POP group, regardless of whether ventilators were used or not, and it is important for the discussion of this result that we have completed the description and added the following to the discussion section of the article: at the same time, we found an interesting phenomenon that NLR levels were higher in the POP group than those in the non-POP group, regardless of whether ventilators were used or not, and this may be because, although mechanical ventilation increases the risk of lung infection, the internal inflammatory state remains an important cause of pneumonia in patients, and NLR is an important predictor of POP.\nThere were several limitations of this study including its observational design. Although we assessed a relatively large sample size, there was still a possibility of selection bias and generalization of the findings to clinics should be progressed with caution. Indeed, POP occurrence rate of patients in the current study was relatively high (30.80%), although POP could occur in up to 13% to 37% of aSAH patients based on the previous studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4,29,30]</u> We included both possible and confirmed POP as a single variable. Because there was no radiological evidence for possible POP (accounted for only 17% of cases in this cohort), many other conditions (eg, viral infection, inflammation) can be mistakenly included as possible POP in this study. The possibility of overestimating the POP rate should be considered. However, our main results remained consistent when we included only confirmed POP cases. Another limitation of this study is that what we did was rooted in single-center data, and for the analysis of group prognosis, there is still gap to the prognosis of individual prognosis. Further research is also needed to determine whether changes in NLR over time are related to the onset of POP.\nIn conclusion, NLR may be helpful for predicting POP in patients with aSAH. The NLR, which is easy to obtain by calculating from the WBC differential count, may help to identify high-risk patients to begin intervention in time. In addition, there may be an additive interaction between WFNS grade and NLR. However, further large-scale studies are still needed to confirm this finding, to evaluate whether the prediction model we established can be used to screen high-risk patients with POP before surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Previous studies have suggested that the pathologic process of IDD is associated with loss of aggrecan and Type II collagen. Aggrecan is highly hydrophilic and maintains water retention, generating a swelling pressure sufficient enough to keep the body stable.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Such unique characteristics of this tissue provide a base for effective diagnosis of early IDD.\nAlthough conventional MRI is frequently used to evaluate patients for IDD, imaging is often insufficient from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Functional MRI (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful imaging modality in the recent years, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can be applied to analyze the different characteristics of tissues. DWI can noninvasively and accurately reveal detailed pathological, physiological, and even biochemical changes at the molecular level in a wide variety of regions.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> The application of fMRI in the diagnosis of brain diseases provides a solid foundation for efficient and accurate future evaluation of IDD. This study explored the application of 7.0T MRI-DWI in the evaluation of IDD.\nIn reference to comparisons between rat and human life spans, a total of 24 healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly selected. These rats were subsequently randomly divided into four groups (A, B, C, and D), each consisting of 3 male and 3 female rats (28, 42, 56, and 70 days old, respectively). Intervertebral disc samples (L1–L6) were dissected from each rat, yielding a total of 144 discs. The Animal Care and Use Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (Shandong, China) approved all animal experimental protocols, according to the National Institute of Health Guide.\nFour groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 1.5‰ isoflurane for 5 min and both conventional MRI and DWI were used to continuously monitor their L1–L6 intervertebral discs. A 7.0T MRI Bruker PharmaScan® instrument (Bruker® Corporation, Germany) was used, and sequences for single-short spin echo planar images were applied for imaging transverse sections of lumbar intervertebral discs. Thirty directions of diffusion-sensitive gradients were applied. The imaging parameters were repetition time (TR) = 5000 ms, echo time (TE) = 104 ms, slice thickness = 5 mm, and diffusion-weighted coefficients (b value) were 0 and 670 s/mm2. The area of observation was utilized to calculate apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) or detection indices of DWI. With the aid of the DTI Studio system, the equatorial portion of intervertebral discs was selected for diffusion imaging. This allowed for comprehensive data collection, while IDD imaging values allowed for accurate mathematical analysis of varying degrees of natural disc degeneration by DWI. Nucleus pulposus ADC values were recorded from the 12 points of the center area, and the mean was calculated. Annulus fibrosis ADC values were recorded from the 16 points of the outer area, and the mean was calculated. Intervertebral disc ADC values from the 28 points were calculated, and the mean was calculated 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nAfter imaging, rats were sacrificed and intervertebral discs (L1–L6) were isolated. A total of 144 intervertebral disc samples (complete intervertebral discs from levels L1–L6) were obtained from four groups (28, 42, 56, and 70 days old). Protein was extracted for the purpose of Western blotting, and aggrecan and Type II collagen content of each intervertebral disc was determined. β-actin was applied as the internal control. Ratio of aggrecan divided by β-actin was recorded, and the ratio of Type II collagen divided by β-actin was recorded. These two ratios were calculated as the values of the corresponding intervertebral disc.\nData were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Results were analyzed using SPSS software  with the homogeneity test of variance and normality test was applied for data analysis. Qualified means of multiple samples were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), while the least significant difference (LSD) pairwise comparison methods were used to compare results. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nAs shown in Table 1, we found that intervertebral disc ADC values among different age groups (Groups A, B, C, and D) decreased with age. TotalADC values of L1 intervertebral discs in Groups A (0.00154 ± 0.00008), B (0.00130 ± 0.00005), C (0.00122 ± 0.00007), and D (0.00107 ± 0.00007) significantly decreased with age (P < 0.01); nucleus pulposus ADC values of L1 intervertebral discs in Groups A (0.00164 ± 0.00005), B (0.00156 ± 0.00007), C (0.00147 ± 0.00008), and D (0.00140 ± 0.00007) significantly decreased with age (P < 0.01); annulus fibrosis ADC values of L1 intervertebral discs in Groups A (0.00129 ± 0.00014), B (0.00110 ± 0.00011), C (0.00095 ± 0.00009), and D (0.00082 ± 0.00012) significantly decreased with age (P < 0.01). Moreover, a comparison of nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosis ADC values of different spinal levels in Group A was performed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>. Nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosis (L1–L6) in Group A were measured, and the statistical analysis of obtained ADC values suggested that nucleus pulposus ADC values in Group A from level L1/L2 (0.00163 ± 0.00006), L2/L3 (0.00154 ± 0.00006), L3/L4 (0.00155 ± 0.00005), L4/L5 (0.00152 ± 0.00004), L5/L6 (0.0015 ± 0.00004), and L6/S1 (0.00139 ± 0.00004) significantly decreased (P < 0.01).

Protein expression of L1 intervertebral discs among different age groups showed that aggrecan content of intervertebral discs in Groups A (1.88 ± 0.16), B (1.59 ± 0.26), C (0.33 ± 0.02), and D (0.17 ± 0.04) significantly decreased with age (P < 0.01); collagen II content of intervertebral discs in Groups A (2.22 ± 0.04), B (1.02 ± 0.03), C (0.29 ± 0.02), and D (0.20 ± 0.01) significantly decreased with age (P < 0.01).

However, no significant differences in aggrecan and collagen II content of L1–L6 intervertebral discs in Group A were noted (P > 0.05).\nProtein content of L1 intervertebral discs among different age groups\n删除重复语句：<u>Protein content of L1 intervertebral discs among different age groups</u>\nData were shown as mean ± SD.

Results revealed a significantly positive correlation (aggrecan: r = 0.631, P < 0.01; Type II collagen: r = 0.680, P < 0.01).\nMultiple factors including cellular processes, extracellular matrix physiology, cytokines, biomechanics, and genetics influence IDD.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8,9]</u> Decreased matrix content as a major etiology, however, has been the focus of the majority of recent studies.\nIn vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that aggrecan and Type II collagen serve important roles in the pathogenesis of IDD.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u> Proteoglycan aggregates in adult human nucleus pulposus are mainly distributed within the extracellular matrix, while those of the annulus fibrosis are mainly distributed between collagen fibers. Aggrecan content increases progressively from the outer annulus fibrosis toward the center of the nucleus pulposus.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Since aggrecan maintains adequate hydration, the nucleus pulposus has a significantly higher water content than the annulus fibrosis does. In addition, the nucleus pulposus is also more elastic.\nWu et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> found proteoglycan aggregates concentration to decrease as age increased. As a result, the intervertebral disc becomes more brittle and loses stability. Type II collagen is the most widely distributed collagen in normal human intervertebral discs, which shows a progressive increase from the periphery toward the center of the nucleus pulposus.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Aggrecan, on the other hand, is integrated into a network frame with collagen. These characteristics not only can be applied to imaging analysis on the basis of molecular motion, but also provide a foundation for studying biochemical components of intervertebral discs in great detail. The influences of proteoglycans on IDD pathogenesis have not been well quantified to date, and our study provides a potentially useful method for evaluating pathophysiological interactions within the rat intervertebral discs via 7.0T MRI.\nThe Pfirrmann grading system, closely related to signal strengths of nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosis, is widely used in the clinical evaluation of IDD.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> However, it is neither accurate nor particularly applicable for diagnosing early disc degeneration, in large part due to subjectivity of the examiner, weak classification effects on aged intervertebral discs, and insufficient capability for accurately assessing the degree of degeneration. A new IDD score system is required for this purpose, along with the ability to accurately detail the degree of disc degeneration.\nIt is therefore of vital importance to explore higher level imaging techniques to study more subtle changes in IDD. Among the various types of MRIs, DWI is mainly used for detecting differences in water content of tissues. In intervertebral discs, water molecules are mainly distributed within the extracellular matrix and DWI can detect diffusion movement and distribution of water molecules. When there is degeneration of intervertebral discs, the movement of free water molecules in tissues becomes limited and their distribution gets altered. DWI can display changes in molecular diffusion of water in tissues and their microstructures.\nPrevious studies have reported DWI to be highly sensitive in displaying early functional changes in tissues. When biochemical compositions of tissues are altered, the diffusion of water molecules is affected and disc degeneration can be detected rapidly by analyzing changes in ADC values.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u> However, as 1.5T and 3.0T MRI are most widely used, these magnetic strengths are not precise or detailed enough for efficient tissue imaging.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u> High-intensity MRI, on the other hand, can be useful.\nDWI imaging is based on molecular flow effects where its signals are derived from free water. DWI, analyzing the diffusion coefficient of fluid in vivo, is the noninvasive way to detect both intra- and extracellular molecular diffusion of water in living organisms.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u> DWI is used to detect molecular changes of water surface tension under gradient changes of field intensity. Compared with spectrum technology, this method does not depend on the concentration of compounds of interest and as such is more sensitive in the diagnosis of early IDD.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> As the intervertebral disc is among the largest avascular tissues in the body, quantitative diffusion techniques can achieve effective real-time monitoring of intervertebral disc composition. A previous study reported water content to decrease with the degenerative process of the intervertebral disc.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>\nTo our knowledge, few studies have reported investigating the use of 7.0T MRI as a diagnostic approach or in evaluating the course of IDD in vivo. We established a degeneration model using intervertebral discs of SD rats and studied their natural degeneration with the aid of 7.0T MRI. Our results indicate that the ADC values of nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosis decrease with age, these findings are in agreement with those of Kealey et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> who reported a decrease of 9% in ADC values as age increased. Lower ADC values were found in the caudal vertebra. Antoniou et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> and Maasumi et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> reported that ADC values also decreased as the severity of IDD progressed. Our experiments utilized SD rats and we found gradually decreasing ADC values of nucleus pulposus with increasing degeneration of spinal segments. The volume of annulus fibrosis was not obviously changed. Similarly, biochemical test results revealed no significant differences between segments in intervertebral disc protein expression, which possibly was associated with the volume of intervertebral disc in the animals.\nIn addition, fMRI revealed ADC values of corresponding areas in nuclei pulposi and annuli fibrosi of the same segment of intervertebral discs in four groups of SD rats to also decrease as the rats aged. This suggests major changes in water content within intervertebral discs, consistent with models of their natural degeneration. In addition, biochemical tests indicated that aggrecan and Type II collagen content in discs decline as rats aged. A gradual decline in water content was also apparent.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Degeneration of the nuclei pulposi and annuli fibrosi was therefore quantitatively assessed by changes in ADC values. Our study further confirmed the feasibility of DWI in assessing relevant changes in the water content of intervertebral discs for the purposes of IDD assessment. Our experiment also found that ADC values correlated well with changes in aggrecan and Type II collagen in the extracellular matrix. Data obtained from DWI assessments could thus indirectly reflect the water content of discs and assess the degree of IDD via changes in ADC values.\n7.0T FMR-DWI is a sensitive, safe, and noninvasive imaging modality not involving radiation. It can not only accurately detect early IDD, but also displays biological changes of molecules in all intervertebral discs imaged; in addition, it can accurately detect the range and degree of degeneration within the same individual as reference. These characteristics make FMR-DWI rather suitable for studying intervertebral discs. Our study applied MRI at 3.0T to quantitatively assess the degeneration of human lumbar intervertebral discs.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> MRI, however, is rarely reported to be used in the quantitative evaluation of early IDD. Utilizing SD rats as models, this study has explored MRI to be certainly feasible in diagnosing human IDD.\nThis study also aimed to evaluate the associations of water content, aggrecan, Type II collagen, and IDD within the lumbar spines of rats. We also aimed to improve the detection rate for diagnosing IDD. However, there is no imaging technology that can obtain a unified understanding of degeneration of the entire spinal column, or any method of data analysis that can satisfactorily analyze and explain all the obtained information simultaneously. High-resolution nuclear MRI may accurately describe the physical morphology of nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosis and allow signal intensity data of images to be applied toward characterization of the intervertebral disc.\nFurthermore, changes of water molecule diffusion in intervertebral discs are regarded as a sign of obvious early IDD, effectively detected by MRI-DWI shortly after early degeneration of the intervertebral disc begins. This study reported ADC values of DWI to be the important indicator in assessing the strength and capacity of water molecule diffusion in degenerating intervertebral discs. Signs of IDD could be detected early by studying the quantitative relations between obtained data; therefore, interventional therapy could be given to decrease degeneration in a timely manner.\nThis study provides a foundation for the establishment of animal models for noninvasive, quantitative IDD analysis. Clinically, application of DWI not only makes up for the shortcomings of conventional MRI in effectively imaging IDD, but also provides a novel way of approaching lower back pathology with fMRI techniques.\nHowever, there are still some limitations in the clinical application of fMRI. First, high magnetic field cannot eliminate the interference signals in other tissues completely. The signal obtained in examination of the intervertebral disc is often mixed with many interference signals of visceral and abdominal wall tissue in front of intervertebral disc that requires manual analysis and reduces the reliability of numerical value. Second, clinical application of high-field magnetic resonance has not been clearly confirmed. There is a lack of human clinical studies on side effects of high-intensity magnetic field, and even few reports on the development of matching bioengineering equipment. Although the application of intervertebral disc in clinic is limited by many factors, the prospect of fMRI is still promising.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by a grant of the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81371998)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

However most of the scholars believe that surgery is the best choice.4,5,6 The treatment goal is to restore the walking ability and eliminate standing pain or even to enable the patient to wear a pair of normal shoes.\nAs for surgeries, a number of authors prefer open reduction and fixation in terms of shaping the anatomical structure of the whole bone and its surrounding joint surfaces, as well as calcaneal and subtalar joint. But the reported rate of wound edge necrosis varies from 2% to 11% due to the thin and vulnerable skin over the lateral calcaneal wall, and the infection rate of calcaneal nearby soft tissue varies from 1.3% to 7% after open reduction fixation via an extended lateral approach.7 However some clinical doctors suggest that considering the occurrence of complications, percutaneous poking reduction and fixation is a better way for intraarticular calcaneal fractures.8,9 In their reports, it is showed that there is a higher functional score and a lower incidence of posttraumatic subtalar arthritis after using the method of closed percutaneous poking reduction. So abundant case-controlled trials (CCTs) have been conducted to compare the outcomes and complications of two methods for the surgical treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures, but the clinical advantages and disadvantages of the two methods still remain debatable. There is a need to systematically review the available evidence for the two methods in treating displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures so as to make an optimal treatment choice.\nThe aim of the present study was to perform a meta-analysis including all the CCTs on Chinese people in the last ten years to determine whether there were any significant differences in the incidence of postoperative complications, the recovery degrees of calcaneal Bohler angle and Gissane angle, and the rate of good foot function after surgery.\nWe searched CCTs including randomized controlled study (RCT) and retrospective case study that compared closed percutaneous poking reduction with open reduction fixation in the treatment of calcaneal fractures for Chinese patients from the Cochrane Library, PubMed, CNKI, Chinese Biomedical Database, Wanfang Data (from January of 2005 to August of 2015).

Dichotomous outcomes were expressed in terms of relative risk (RR) and the weighted mean difference (WMD) was used for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Heterogeneity was tested using both chi-square test and I2 test. A fixed-effects model was chosen when there was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity and random-effects model was adopted if significant heterogeneity was found. If the heterogeneity was found, we checked the study population, treatment, outcome and methodologies to determine the source of heterogeneity. If it could not be quantitatively synthesized or the event rate was too low to be measured, we used qualitative evaluation.

All of them were CCTs and the possibility of a bias was low. But the funnel figure showed that there was a small bias, which may be associated with the incomplete collection of relevant literature, insufficient sample size and the different level of clinical physicians. Sensitivity analysis showed a good overall result .\nThe calcaneal fractures result in heal in improper anatomical position which will lead to static and dynamic malfunctions of the whole foot with consequent limited load bearing capacity and walking ability. Surgery is the favored technique for closed intraarticular calcaneal fracture displacement.26,27 At present, there are lots of operative methods for the treatment of calcaneal fractures. Among that, the open procedures using internal fixation have been favored for surgical therapy of the calcaneal fractures. This kind of method has many advantages, at the same time also has many disadvantages, such as skin necrosis and wound infection may be difficult to avoid.\nSome scholars presented a minimally invasive technique for the treatment of intraarticular, dislocated calcaneus fractures and were able to produce results comparable to open techniques with a lower rate of serious complications. Although better outcomes were obtained by surgical treatment in anatomical restoration and functional recovery, patients treated with open procedure had a significantly higher risk of complications than the percutaneous ones. In order to reduce the high complication rate caused by open repair surgery, recently, percutaneous repair surgery has been applied in clinical treatment and shows promising results. Schepers28 indicated percutaneous distractional reduction and fixation to be a safe technique with overall good results and an acceptable complication rate. Dewall29 in a retrospective cohort study found that the percutaneous method of reducing and fixing calcaneus fractures minimised complications. Results from Woon30 showed that the percutaneous approach could avoid soft tissue complications associated with open reduction.\nThe purpose of this review was to provide additional insight into the options for treating displaced calcaneal fractures, focusing on the efficacy and safety of percutaneous poking reduction compared with open reduction. The short-term complications evaluated included skin necrosis and wound infection; while the long-term complications evaluated incorporated secondary surgery and progression of arthritis. From this meta-analysis, the incidence of complications after operation showed statistical difference between percutaneous poking reduction and open reduction for displaced calcaneal fractures. In other words, the incidence of complications after operation occurred significantly higher in open reduction and fixation group. Then we further compared the degrees of recovery for calcaneal Bohler angle and Gissane angle between the two therapies, and found no statistical difference. A good ankle joint function after surgery has a great impact on the quality of patient's life. In present meta-analysis, there was no difference in the rate of good post-operative foot function between two treatments.\nThe treatment of displaced calcaneal fractures is a clinical problem that has bothered orthopaedic surgeons for a long time. We believe that this study can provide some evidence to guide clinical practice. But our meta-analysis has some limitation. First only 15 CCTs were included in this study. Second, the follow-up periods of most studies were not long enough to confirm the results. Third, most of the retrieved documents were Chinese articles and there may be language bias.\nIn conclusion, this study shows that the foot function can be restored by both percutaneous poking reduction and open reduction despite the latter has a higher rate of complication after operation. In future studies, more multicentre, large-scale and high quality CCTs should be analyzed to further prove the conclusion.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2016.10.001</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}
{"seq_id": "b4b8d024-58e4-47f5-b804-f458e9113e79", "title": "", "text": "【0】Over the past 20 years, as the spectrum of disease changes, the incidence of chronic wounds gradually increases.1 The status quo of clinical medical staff, especially those in the primary or community hospitals, tend to deal with wounds, especially for chronic wounds, according to their own experience. The wound is only treated as a simple wound, and the etiology of chronic refractory wound and the discipline of chronic wound repair are ignored, and the effect of etiological treatment is not achieved. In addition, the properties of the wound are characterized by morphology, and the description of the wound plays a vital role in the correctly medical history collection and diagnosis.\nTherefore, the description and record of the wound should be based on morphological description. However, it is difficult to add morphological imaging data to the traditional paper medical records. Electronic health records (EHRs), on the other hand, are lack of tailored contents dedicated to wound description.\nIn order to further standardize the diagnosis and treatment practice of chronic refractory wounds, and to develop more accurate format of clinical history record which can correctly reflect the patient's course and treatment progress, and to standardize the medical history record of chronic refractory wounds that can be deployed at the national or regional level, entrusted by the Expert Panel of Chinese Medical Doctor Association (CMDA), we designed the WoundCareLog APP as a recording tool for wound healing specialist at all levels of medical institutions in China.\nThe WoundCareLog APP, which was approved by the Expert Panel of CMDA, was designed with the core philosophy of \"Thoughts and principles of diagnosis and treatment of chronic refractory wound in China\",2 that are: 1. Etiological diagnosis and treatment for chronic refractory wounds; 2. Phase and selectivity-dependent treatment; 3. Linkage of specialist and wound therapist, that is, a combination of surgical treatment and conservative treatment of chronic refractory wounds.\nThe WoundCareLog APP is fully compatible in form to meet the criteria and requirements of traditional medical records. In addition, the demands for morphological description of wounds in wound healing diagnosis and treatment have been fulfilled by the embedding of digital imaging technology to overcome the inadequacies of traditional medical history records.\nThe entry of WoundCareLog APP information, according to the logical sequence of the medical history record, is divided into 9 modules as follows:\nUsers need to fill in the patient demographics, including: National ID number, name, date of birth, gender, phone number, home address, first admission time, etc. Age is one of the important factors interfering with wound healing.2 Elderly patients may experience delayed wound healing compared to younger people, and the elderly are often accompanied by a variety of age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension or arrhythmia, etc. At different stages of child development, skin regeneration and repair also have characteristics different from those of adults. There are many wounds that adults do not have or rarely occurring, such as neonatal toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and the treatment strategy should not be copied from adults’ patient treatment. Therefore, information such as patient age is to understand the prevalence of different age levels and to understand the pathological features of the wound at different ages. The entry of the ID number and the mailing address allows the medical staff to carry out post-discharge follow-up work for the patient.\nEtiological diagnosis and treatment is one of the core ideas of chronic refractory wounds treatment. CC is usually the main reason for the patient's visit and the main contradiction of the disease. The HPC is the records of entire process of diagnosis and treatment. The PMH refers to the total sum of a patient's health status prior to the presenting problem especially the diseases closely related to the current disease. Accurate record of the information can help users determine the priority of the wounds and the etiology analysis related to the formation of the wounds.\nAt present, it's not surprising that the knowledgement of properly recording patient medical history is not satisfactory of the wound healing specialist among the medical institutions at all levels in China. In order to enhance the ability to write medical history, WoundCareLog APP users are required to fill the CC and HPC information in the text box under each category and to choose the corresponding PMH values from pre-set options.\nBy doing so, it can help us establish a standard and specific medical history record format for wound healing specialist.\nAccurate wound assessment is a critical component of effective wound management. Wound assessment includes: wounds location, the date of wound occur, physical examination (PE) of arterial and venous conditions at relevant sites, wound factors (such as dimensions, tissue types, exudate), periwound skin factors (such as dry/scaling, erythema, fragile, pain, skin pigmentation, cellulitis, etc), wound photographs.\nThe above-mentioned wound information covers almost all the content that needs to be collected for wound diagnosis and treatment. Detailed wound information supplemented by high-definition images before and after cleaning and before and after debridement can more accurately reflect the true condition of the wound before and after treatment, which is more intuitive and effective than the written record. It can help wound healing specialists to further accurately record wound and to help to establish a specialist medical history specification for the wound healing department.\nLaboratory tests include: common clinical laboratory examinations and special examinations related to refractory wounds. \"Diagnosis and treatment of chronic refractory wounds based on its etiology\" is one of the core ideas in the article \"Thoughts and principles of diagnosis and treatment of chronic refractory wound in China\" . It is especially important to give targeted examination, diagnosis and differential diagnosis to patients with chronic refractory wounds for different pathogenic factors.\nFor example, most chronic refractory wounds contain bacterial infections.3 When bacteria form biofilms, they can reduce the phagocytic ability of phagocytic cells to bacteria, enhance microbial ability to resist human immunity, and make chronic refractory wounds stay in the inflammatory phase for a long time and the massive proliferation of bacteria with the secretion of toxic factors block the wound healing process. Therefore, it is important to have bacteriology and drug sensitivity of isolated bacteria obtained from wound site.\nLower extremity vascular ulcer is divided into arterial ischemic ulcer, venous congestion ulcer and mixed ulcer. Lower extremity vascular disease can be diagnosed by means of lower extremity vascular color Doppler ultra-sonography and arterial digital subtraction angiography.\nFor neuropathy and lower extremity ulcers caused by diatete, diagnosis can be made by means of sensory quantitative measurement, electromyography or tuning fork vibration sensory examination.\nThe relevant laboratory test reports can be uploaded by users of WoundCareLog App in the form of images.\nThe user makes diagnosis of the disease and its pathological reasons based on the above-mentioned chief CC, HPC, PMH and related laboratory tests. At present, the main common wound etiological factors include: infections, pressure, trauma, diabetes, burns, intravenous, arterial, iatrogenic, malignant tumor and radiation injury, etc.1,4 Users can select the above ten etiological factors results, or choose other self-filling according to the specific situation.\nThe user of WoundCareLog APP can reasonably choose the methods of wound treatment, surgical or conservative according to the diagnosis. Medical care linkage, that is, the combination of surgical treatment and conservative treatment is one of the core ideas of Dong et al.2 Treatment of chronic refractory wounds is often comprehensive, including conservative dressing changes for wounds, adjustment of systemic nutritional status and treatment of underlying diseases, physiotherapy and hyperbaric oxygen, and surgical treatment. The corresponding treatment methods have detailed instructions, and strive to enable wound healing professionals to quickly and accurately obtain product information, so as to be able to meet the core ideas of \"Thoughts and principles of diagnosis and treatment of chronic refractory wound in China\" , indicated as phase and selectivity-dependent treatment.\nThe bookmark function, for transferring the patient to a different department, is for the unit that is currently engaged in the treatment of wound repair specialists, which medical care linkage is limited by the medical institution's limitation and the medical care linkage cannot be effectively carried out. In the case, the referral module is set in WoundCareLog APP, making it possible to carry out medical care linkage within the region (within Shanghai city center area).\nRehabilitation and related health education is particularly important for chronic refractory wounds,5 especially chronic refractory wounds represented by pressure ulcers6 and diabetic foot ulcers .7 The user of WoundCareLog APP is required to fill in the relevant content. Take pressure ulcers patients as an example, users should teach the individual and family about risk for pressure injury and engage individual and family in risk reduction interventions. As for diabetic foot ulcers patients, users should provide information on basic foot care advice including advice on appropriate foot wear and wound care.\nThe clinical outcomes of wounds, as shown in studies,8,9 include: 1- healed; 2– more than 85% healed; 3– patients lost to follow-up; 4– palliative (wound has no change for more than 8 weeks); 5– patients transferred department or hospital; and 6– malignant degeneration of chronic wounds into cancer. The user of WoundCareLog APP can make the selection accordingly.\nMany chronic wound patients still need to follow up after treatment and heal, so the importance of clinical follow-up is selfevident.\nThe clinical follow-up time point of patients with chronic refractory wounds is different based on the etiology. For example, if the patient's nutritional status is not improved or the partial pressure is not removed, the pressure ulcer is easily recurred; if the blood sugar condition is not well controlled or the high pressure under the foot is not adequately reduced, ulcers may occur. Therefore, the users of WoundCareLog APP are required to make a clinical follow-up record in the text box under this category at the time of three months or six months after the patient is healed and discharged.\nSince the launch of the WoundCareLog APP in January 2018, there are currently more than 1000 medical institutions, and nearly 3000 wound healing medical professionals are in use. The number of cases in the database exceeds 10,000. The WoundCareLog APP is designed to require users to enter the key information before submitting the current case information. To our best knowledge, WoundCareLog APP is the first tool in the world which emphasis on the standardization of medical history record of chronic refractory wounds that can be deployed at the national or regional level. Relevant data analysis work is in progress, and more related articles are being drafted.\n1.

Options available to control haemorrhage in pelvic fractures include external fixation, angiography and embolization etc. But when all these measures fail or are unavailable, there is no option but to frustratingly watch the precious life slipping away.\nBut now an option is available i.e. rFVIIa. It is recombinant activated coagulation factor VII. It stops bleeding fast by a site specific mechanism of action by acting on factor X. In large pharmacologic doses, rFVIIa can bypass several steps in the clotting cascade, interacting directly with the activated platelet to produce a thrombin burst and ultimately fibrin. By using it locally, haemostasis is achieved quickly, without any side effect which in turn decreases the need for transfusion and its complications.\nRecently, there has been an increasing interest in the use of rFVIIa to treat bleeds in non-haemophiliac patients. Several case reports have suggested that this agent may be effective in treating non-haemophiliac patients with traumatic and other types of bleeds. Although its use is relatively new to trauma care, several authors have reported on the use of rFVIIa.删除4：<u>2,3,4,5,6</u>\nA 23-year-old male patient with the history of road traffic accident presented to our emergency ward in a state of shock. On examination patient was conscious with pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/40 mmHg. Degloving injury on right side thigh and pelvis was noted on further examination. No pelvic compression test was done. Crepitus was noted on shifting of patient to operation theater (OT) for external fixator application. Abdomen was soft, non-tender with mild distension. Patient was resuscitated with central venous line, intravenous crystalloid and colloids. Radiographs were taken in the OT.\nPatient was diagnosed as a case of open type C1 pelvic injury with extra peritoneal rupture of bladder and urethra on the OT table.\nAnterior pelvic fixator was applied followed by suprapubic cystostomy, drain in retropubic space, debridement, and packing of cavity in OT under anaesthesia . These events took one hour and forty minutes from the time patient was received in emergency.\nPatient was shifted to intensive care unit but continued to bleed in drains with no improvement in vitals even after twelve units of whole blood with four units of fresh frozen plasma and four units of platelets transfusion (another ten hours passed). After twelve hours of resuscitation with all the possible methods available with us at that time bleeding was not controlled. Then it was decided to try rFVIIa based on some background knowledge of the treating orthopaedic surgeon for its use in wars to control massive haemorrhages.\nInjection rFVIIa was administered at the dose of 100 mcg/kg i.e. 4.8 mg. Within one hour of administration blood pressure stabilised to 100/70 mmHg and bleeding reduced dramatically.\nPatient had received a total of twelve units of blood before using rFVIIa within twelve hours and four units after the injection in three days.\nTraditionally recombinant factor VIIa has been used for haemophilia. Its use for treatment of trauma induced coagulopathy is relatively new with the first case reported in 1999 followed by anecdotal use reported by several authors.\nAlthough the mechanism of action for levels of rFVIIa used in trauma is not fully elucidated at pharmacological level, it jumpstarts the defective coagulation process by bypassing several steps in clotting cascade, interacting directly with activated platelets to produce a thrombin burst and ultimately fibrin.\nBut there is a caveat to its use as it is a potent agent and theoretically predisposes a susceptible patient to thromboembolic complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction and deep vein thrombosis. That is the reason it is approved by Food and Drug Administration only for the treatment of haemophilia with all trauma uses being off label. Nevertheless there are several studies pertaining to use of rFVIIa for trauma although anecdotal and retrospective.\nMartinowitz et al7 noted that its use caused cessation of bleeding and decreased need for transfusions. They reported on the use of rFVIIa in 19 trauma patients, including patients from previous reports. Using one to three doses of rFVIIa, cessation of hemorrhage was documented in 79% of patients, transfusion requirements decreased and 13/19 (68%) patients survived. Review of animal studies confirmed the safety of drug in animal trials and suggested that rFVIIa is not associated with increased thromboembolic complications.\nIn 2004 Dutton et al.6 reported reversal of coagulopathy. Coagulopathy was reversed in 61 out of 81 cases (75%), with 42% of patients surviving. In their series the indications for use of rFVIIa included acute post-traumatic haemorrhage, severe traumatic brain injury, septic coagulopathy, and factor deficiencies. In 2005 Boffard et al.8 published the result of a two armed randomized placebo control, double blinded study to examine the effect of rFVIIA in trauma patients. The trial demonstrated that there was a statistically significant reduction in the need for transfusional requirement in blunt trauma group, whereas the penetrating trauma group showed no benefit. In addition the trial demonstrated the safety of rFVIIa.\nIn 2010 Hauser et al.9 published the results of a large phase III randomised clinical trial called control trial evaluating safety and efficacy of rFVIIa. They concluded that rFVIIa reduced the use of blood products but did not affect mortality. Further they opined that the use of drug was safe to use.\nIn conclusion, adjunctive procoagulant agent such as rFVIIa should be used in any salvageable patient with massive uncontrolled bleeding who has not responded to conventional surgical measures and appropriate blood components in a case of severe pelvic trauma.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2015.08.007</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The objective of this study was to compare the effects and toxicities in NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed monotherapy versus pemetrexed plus a platinum combination agent, so as to provide a basis for standard second-line chemotherapy.Methods The clinical data of 52 patients with NSCLC who were admitted to Shanghai Chest Hospital from August 2006 to October 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. Ten of the 52 patients received pemetrexed monotherapy, and the other 42 patients received the pemetrexed plus platinum regimen. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). The progression-free survival time (PFS) was analyzed and the effects and toxicities were assessed. Survival analysis was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method. Single factor analysis and the COX regression model were done to analyze the relationship between the influential factors and the prognosis of disease. The elderly patients (&gt;60 years old) were analyzed separately as a subgroup.Results No statistically significant increase in OS (X2=0.09, P=0.76), PFS(X2=0.15, P=0.70), disease control rate (DCR) (X2=0.06, P=-0.81 ) or 1-year survival rate (X2=0.33, P=-0.57) was found between the two regimens. Single factor analysis showed that the factors including surgery history, PS score before treatment, clinical stage, and response to second-line treatment influenced the prognosis of NSCLC (all P &lt;0.05). COX regression analysis demonstrated that surgery history (P=0.041) and performance status (PS) score before treatment (P=0.043) may be associated with survival. The toxicity of the two regimens was similar.

Patients with cirrhosis and CSPH undergoing hepatectomy for HCC, especially those undergoing major hepatectomy, have higher mortality and risks of PLD than patients undergoing resection with cirrhosis and no CSPH.2,4 Patients with cirrhosis and CSPH usually have concomitant secondary hypersplenism, and splenectomy (Spx) is commonly used to treat these patients in the Asia-Pacific region.5 However, the impact of simultaneous Spx and hepatectomy in patients with HCC and CSPH remains unclear.\nSimultaneous Spx is reported to prevent small-for-size graft syndrome (SFSS) after adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).6 This concept of SFSS in LDLT has been applied to small remnant liver volumes after major hepatectomy, as they share similar mechanisms of liver mass reduction with excessively high portal flow through the liver.7,8 This strongly suggests that simultaneous Spx could improve PLD in patients with CSPH undergoing liver resection for HCC.\nSeveral studies have reported that simultaneous Spx improves short-term postoperative outcomes (PLD, morbidity, and mortality). However, these studies either had high heterogeneities in underlying liver diseases and other covariates among their enrolled patients or used no measures to effectively balance confounders, especially when PLD analysis was performed.9,10 Furthermore, there was no consensus among these studies on whether simultaneous Spx had long-term benefits.11,12 To the best of our knowledge, no randomized controlled clinical trials have been performed to clarify the impact of simultaneous Spx and liver resection on PLD, postoperative complications, and long-term survival in patients with HCC and CSPH. The 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines on HCC did not formally preclude minor hepatectomy in CSPH patients with good liver function and a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of <10, although the guidelines still state that CSPH patients undergoing major hepatectomy have the highest risk of PLD-related mortality (25%).2 Therefore, it is important to elucidate the effect of simultaneous Spx on posthepatectomy outcomes in patients with HCC and CSPH undergoing liver resection, especially in those treated with major hepatectomy.\nThis study aimed to elucidate the role of simultaneous Spx and liver resection with curative intent on posthepatectomy outcomes in patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH, especially in patients who were treated with major hepatectomy.\nThis retrospective study included consecutive patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC, liver cirrhosis, and CSPH, who underwent partial hepatectomy at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (EHBH) between January 2011 and December 2016. Preoperative CSPH was clearly defined as the presence of endoscopically-confirmed gastroesophageal varices with or without splenomegaly (maximal length, >12 cm on ultrasound) and a platelet count of <109/L.1,13 The inclusion criteria were patients 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> who underwent curative liver resection for histopathologically-diagnosed HBV-related HCC; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> with preoperative diagnoses of CSPH; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> with Child-Pugh A or B liver function; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> with a good performance status of <2 points on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> who initially underwent curative surgical resection with or without Spx.

In addition, postoperative tumor pathological features were recorded for survival analysis.\nPLD was defined according to the International Study Group for Liver Surgery (ISGLS) as an increase in international normalized ratio (INR) and hyperbilirubinemia (based on the normal cut-off value of the local laboratory) on or after postoperative day 5 (POD5).16 In the present study, grade B or C PLD patients were defined as those with severe postoperative liver dysfunction (SPLD), as grade A PLD patients have been reported to have very low PLD-related mortality. Grade A PLD patients received regular clinical management; grade B PLD patients deviated from it but had no requirement for invasive therapy, and grade C PLD patients required invasive therapy. Major hepatectomy was defined as the resection of ≥3 Couinaud liver segments.\nExcessive alcohol consumption was defined as an ethanol intake of ≥40 g/day for males and ≥20 g/day for females, or a recent drinking history with an ethanol intake of ≥80 g/day within 2 weeks of the surgery. Patients with hypertension were defined as exhibiting either systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg, or the use of antihypertensive medications. A fasting blood glucose level ≥7.0 mmol/L and/or use of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin were the criteria used to define diabetes mellitus. The Edmondson-Steiner classification was used to assess the degree of tumor differentiation.17 Microvascular invasion (MVI) was only detected under microscopy by visualizing cancer cell nest infiltration in a vascular lumen lined by endothelium, such as a portal vein radicle.删除4：<u>18</u>\nThe Child-Pugh score was used to classify patients into grades A (≤6 points), B (7-9 points), and C (≥10 points). The following equation was used to calculate the MELD score: {(0.957 × Ln creatinine [mg/dl] + 0.378 × Ln TBIL [mg/dl] + 1.120 × Ln [INR] + 0.643) × 10}, in which Ln stands for naturalized logarithm. Patients were assigned to a high-risk group if their MELD score was ≥10.19 The Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score was calculated using the formula: 0.66 × log10 bilirubin [mmol/L] - 0.085 × albumin [g/L].20 The formula for the AST to platelets (PLT) ratio index (APRI) used was {(aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/upper limit of normal [ULN])/platelet [109/L]} × 100.21 Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) was calculated using the following formula: (age [years] × AST [U/L])/(platelets [109/L] × alanine aminotransferase [ALT] [U/L]1/2).22 The ratio of AST to ALT was changed into a binary variable by dichotomizing its distribution at the cut-off value of the 75th percentile (three-quarters [Q3]).删除4：<u>23,24</u>\nHepatectomy was performed as per the hospital HCC guidelines, but also on the recommendation of a multidisciplinary HCC management board meeting, when the consensus reached was that hepatectomy or simultaneous Spx were the most beneficial of the available treatment options.\nCurative liver resection was defined as complete resection of all visible tumors with no residual tumor cells left on the resection margins, as verified by histopathological examination of the resected specimens. Spx was performed only in patients with hypersplenism and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, <60 × 109/L) or when a sharp rise in intraoperative portal pressure was found after unclamping. Dissection of the splenic artery and vein was carefully performed, and ligation of these two vessels was performed as close as possible to the splenic hilum. Blood loss was assessed as the volume of liquid in the suction apparatus minus the saline volume used for irrigation, together with the increase in sponge weight at the end of hepatectomy. Liver, kidney, and coagulation function tests were routinely sampled on PODs 1, 3, 5, and 7, or more frequently, as considered appropriate.\nThe primary endpoint was the occurrence of SPLD according to the ISGLS definition stated above. The secondary study endpoints were postoperative 90-day severe morbidity and 90-day mortality rates. Postoperative complications were graded based on the Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification, and 90-day severe morbidity was defined as the highest CD grade, IIIB or higher in patients within 90 days after hepatectomy.25 A root-cause analysis to detect any preventable causes of postoperative death was performed for all deaths within POD 90. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were also the secondary study endpoints. OS was determined based on the time elapsed between the date of surgery and death or last follow-up. RFS was defined as the time elapsed between the date of surgery and the date of the first diagnosis of recurrence, or death following liver resection. Patients were followed up once every 2 months in the first 2 postoperative years and then once every 3-6 months. The study was conducted in June 2020.\nCategorical variables are displayed as frequencies (percentage, %) and evaluated using the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test. Depending on whether the continuous variables were normally distributed and had homogeneity of variance, they were displayed as mean values (standard deviation [SD]) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) and compared using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test, as appropriate. The primary endpoint of SPLD (ISGLS B and C) and secondary endpoints (postoperative 90-day severe morbidity and SPLD-related mortality) were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, respectively. Survival curves for OS and RFS were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and assessed using the log-rank test. Survival assessments were performed using the Cox univariate/multivariate regression analysis. Variables with p-values <0.05 on univariate regression analysis were included in further multivariate regression analysis.\nTo adjust for potential confounders and selection biases in the study covariates while preserving an adequate sample size, we performed propensity score matching (PSM) and stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) methods based on the propensity scores derived from the logistic regression analysis.26,27 Standardized mean difference (SMD), as calculated to evaluate the balance of variables, was ≤0.1 between the weighted populations to indicate a negligible difference. In addition, propensity scores were calculated using pre- and intraoperative variables. After propensity score estimation, the matched cohorts were based on a 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching algorithm. To explore the impact of the extent of hepatectomy on PLD, subgroup analyses were performed within the PSM-matched groups using tests of interaction to determine the heterogeneity of treatment effects. Using two-tailed tests, p-values of <0.05 were defined as statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using R  and SPSS .\nOf 2390 HBV-related patients who underwent liver resection for HCC in our center during the study period, 691 had cirrhosis and CSPH. A total of 565 patients underwent partial hepatectomy alone (non-Spx group), and 126 patients underwent hepatectomy and simultaneous Spx (Spx group). Chronic HBV infection was the primary underlying liver disease and 86 patients (12.4%) had a history of chronic alcohol abuse .\nBaseline features of HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy with or without simultaneous splenectomy in unmatched cohort\n删除重复语句：<u>Baseline features of HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy with or without simultaneous splenectomy in unmatched cohort</u>\nNote: Data were presented as n (%) or median (IQR).

The Child-Pugh classification demonstrated that most patients had compensated liver function, and only 20 (2.9%) patients had Child-Pugh class B liver function in the unmatched cohorts . Most pre- and intraoperative features were balanced between the two groups, with the exception of gastroesophageal varices, prothrombin time, ALBI, the ratio of AST to ALT, and alpha fetoprotein. In addition, a larger proportion of patients in the Spx group underwent major hepatectomies .\nPSM and IPTW were performed to adjust for any potential confounders of pre- and intraoperative covariates.26,27 After PSM, 93 pairs of patients were matched in the two PSM cohorts . A comparison of the variables after PSM and the distributions of the propensity scores before and after PSM are shown in Supporting Information: Table 1 and Figure 1, respectively. No significant differences were found between the matched groups. The SMD, which reflects any differences between the two weighted groups, was <0.10 after stabilized IPTW .6,27 Therefore, three cohorts (i.e. the unmatched, PSM matched, and IPTW weighted cohorts) were obtained in this study.\nIn the unmatched cohort, the incidence of SPLD (17, 13.5%) was significantly lower in the Spx group than in the non-Spx group (n = 139, 24.6%; p = 0.010). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that Spx was an independent protective factor for SPLD in the unmatched cohort (odds ratio [OR] = 0.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11-0.43, p < 0.001), which was further confirmed in the PSM (OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.07-0.61, p = 0.477) and stabilized IPTW cohorts (OR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.07-0.35, p < 0.001).\nMultivariate analyses of HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy with or without simultaneous splenectomy in three different cohorts\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate analyses of HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy with or without simultaneous splenectomy in three different cohorts</u>\nNote: p Values <0.05 were defined as statistically significant and shown in bold.\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; HR, hazard ratio; IPTW, inverse probability of treatment weighting; NA, not adopted; OR, odds ratio; OS, overall survival; PSM, propensity score matching; RFS, recurrence-free survival; SPLD, severe posthepatectomy liver dysfunction.\naOR used in Logistic regression model, and HR used in Cox regression model.\nPatients in the non-Spx group had higher 90-day SPLD-related mortality (n = 61, 10.8%) than those in the Spx group (n = 4, 3.2%). Simultaneous Spx was found to significantly decrease 90-day SPLD-related mortality (OR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.06-0.55, p = 0.004) based on multivariate logistic regression results .\nFurthermore, in the PSM and IPTW cohorts, multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that Spx was a protective factor for 90-day SPLD-related mortality (OR= 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05-0.56, p= 0.005 and OR= 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02-0.38, p = 0.002, respectively). In addition, in the matched cohort, four patients had portal vein thrombosis (PVT)-related deaths, accounting for 11.8% of the total deaths in the Spx group based on root-cause analysis.\nFor postoperative 90-day severe morbidity, there were no significant differences between the non-Spx (n = 112, 19.8% and n = 72, 12.7%) and Spx groups (n = 23, 18.3% and n = 12, 9.5%) in the unmatched cohort . Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that Spx was not an independent beneficial factor for 90-day severe morbidity in the unmatched cohort . In the PSM matched and IPTW weighted cohorts, logistic regression analyses further confirmed these results .\nIn the unmatched cohort, the Spx group (n = 126) had better OS and RFS than the non-Spx group (n = 565), as shown by the KM curves (p= 0.023, p= 0.029) in Figure 2B and Supporting Information: Figure 2A. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed Spx to be an independent protective factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63, 95% CI= 0.47-0.85, p= 0.002) and RFS (HR= 0.71, 95% CI= 0.55-0.92, p= 0.011) in the unmatched cohort .\nThe significantly better OS was further confirmed by analyses of the PSM and IPTW cohorts (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.36-0.80, p = 0.002; HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.38-0.83, p= 0.004). However, there were no significant differences in RFS 通用删除1(英):<u>(Supporting Information: Figure 2B,C)</u>, and Cox regression analyses revealed that Spx was not an independent beneficial factor for RFS in PSM-matched and IPTW-weighted cohorts 通用删除1(英):<u>(Supporting Information: Tables 15 and 16)</u>. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year OS and RFS rates for the unmatched, PSM, and IPTW cohorts are shown in Supporting Information: Tables 17 and 18, respectively. These results showed that Spx significantly improved the OS of patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH after liver resection, but not the RFS.\nThe 2018 EASL guidelines on HCC open a door to minor hepatectomy for patients with cirrhosis and CSPH with a MELD score of <10 but not for patients who undergo major hepatectomy because of the high risks of liver decompensation (>30%) and liver decompensation-related mortality (>25%).1,2 Subgroup analyses on the matched cohorts were performed in the subgroup of patients who underwent minor or major hepatectomy on the impact of simultaneous Spx on posthepatectomy short-term (SPLD, 90-day severe morbidity, and SPLD-related mortality) and long-term outcomes (OS and RFS). There was no significant heterogeneity in the HRs, as shown in Table 3. The results of the survival analysis are shown in Supporting Information: Figure 3. Simultaneous Spx significantly reduced the risks of SPLD and 90-day mortality in patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH, irrespective of minor or major liver resection. Thus, simultaneous Spx also benefited patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH who were treated with major hepatectomy.\nSubgroup analyses of splenectomy versus nonsplenectomy patients based on hepatectomy extent\n删除重复语句：<u>Subgroup analyses of splenectomy versus nonsplenectomy patients based on hepatectomy extent</u>\nNote: p Values <0.05 were defined as statistically significant and shown in bold.\nAbbreviations: HR, Hazard ratio; OR, Odds ratio; OS, Overall survival; SPLD, Severe posthepatectomy liver dysfunction.\nLiver resection is the most commonly used first-line treatment for patients with resectable HCC with preserved liver function.2 However, in patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH, partial hepatectomy, especially major hepatectomy, can result in unacceptably high PLD and PLD-related mortality rates. Thus, many guidelines do not recommend liver resection for these patients.28,29,30,31 Measures to reduce these risks are important challenges for liver surgeons. In this study, patients with HBV-related HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH were enrolled to determine whether simultaneous Spx could reduce these risks in patients undergoing hepatectomy, especially major hepatectomy.\nSpx has been performed to treat primary hypersplenism since the 1950s and has also been used to treat patients with hypersplenism secondary to cirrhosis.5,32 As Spx can significantly lower portal pressure, increase the number of postoperative platelet counts, and reduce risks of bleeding varices, partial hepatectomy combined with Spx has been used to treat patients with HCC, cirrhosis, CSPH, and hypersplenism.5,33 However, the indications for Spx remain controversial, as it can be associated with severe septic complications and PVT in patients with hypersplenism treated with Spx.5,34 PVT is a potentially lethal but not an uncommon complication after Spx.5 In the present study, four PVT-related deaths were observed after Spx in the matched cohorts based on root-cause analysis, accounting for 11.8% of the total deaths. In addition, the simultaneous Spx group did not have any severe infection-related mortality or Spx-related morbidity. In contrast, simultaneous Spx was found to significantly decrease SPLD occurrence and SPLD-related 90-day mortality, and significantly prolong OS, although there was no improvement in RFS. As solid evidence from retrospective studies is difficult to obtain and there are no randomized controlled trials on the effect of simultaneous Spx on postoperative outcomes in patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH, PSM and stabilized IPTW were used to obtain a higher level of evidence in this study to overcome the influence of confounding factors and selection biases. The results of this study showed that simultaneous Spx for patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH is feasible and therapeutically beneficial.\nAs shown in this study, the benefits of simultaneous Spx were consistent across both minor and major liver resection subgroups, and the results were superior to those of partial hepatectomy alone, even for patients treated with major hepatectomy. Elevated portal pressure after major hepatectomy could result in the occurrence of postoperative liver failure,8 as reflected in a thought-provoking case report by Takamatsu et al.35 which provided a low level of evidence. In this case report, the patient developed PLD and presented with hepatic encephalopathy after major hepatectomy. Severe postoperative liver failure was reversed after delayed Spx to achieve a complete recovery from SPLD.35 Thus, simultaneous Spx should be seriously considered in patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH who are planning to undergo liver resection, especially major liver resection.\nThis study also identified other important risk factors for SPLD, including gastroesophageal varices and porta hepatis occlusion time. Gastroesophageal varices are a clinical hallmark of CSPH, and variceal bleeding can result in death due to blood loss or acute-on-chronic liver failure. Therefore, partial hepatectomy in the context of gastroesophageal varices could worsen portal hypertension and functional liver reserve.31,36 Longer porta hepatis occlusion times are associated with more severe parenchymal damage induced by ischemic reperfusion injury.37 Intermittent portal clamping is preferred to continuous clamping to minimize total clamp time and avoid total vascular exclusion of the liver, and should therefore be used in liver resection for patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH.\nThe hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is an accurate measure to determine portal venous pressure and is regarded as the standard method for evaluating portal hypertension.38 An increase in HVPG has been shown not only to be associated with PLD and mortality in patients with HCC and cirrhosis but also to impair the long-term survival of these patients after resection.38,39,40 HVPG of >10 mmHg is the gold standard for defining CSPH.38 However, HVPG measurement is not routinely performed in clinical practice because of its invasiveness, high cost, and requirement for operator expertise.41 In our study, all patients with HCC also had cirrhosis and CSPH, and Spx improved their OS. Moreover, the absence of tumor encapsulation, the presence of MVI, and poor tumor differentiation were found to be independently related to poor long-term survival in these patients.\nThis study had some limitations. First, this was a retrospective study. Although PSM and stabilized IPTW analyses were used to minimize the impact of possible confounders, there are inherent flaws in this type of study. Second, the indocyanine green 15 min clearance test, a commonly used test to assess preoperative hepatic functional reserve in many countries, was not used. Third, there was no actual measurement of the portal venous pressure during the perioperative period. Fourth, the patients in this study underwent simultaneous Spx. When compared to Spx, splenic artery ligation or embolization has been found to be a less invasive treatment for patients with hypersplenism and thrombocytopenia.42,43 Splenic artery ligation has also been shown to improve remnant liver function by modulating portal blood flow in animal models.44,45 Thus, combining splenic artery ligation or embolization with hepatectomy could be a method to treat patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH. However, no clinical data on this approach were available in this study. Therefore, the findings obtained from this study need further confirmation by better-designed studies, preferably in the form of prospective multi-institutional randomized studies.\nIn conclusion, simultaneous Spx improved outcomes of patients with HCC, cirrhosis, and CSPH treated with partial hepatectomy, irrespective of minor or major liver resection . Prevention of SPLD should be achieved through strict pre- and intraoperative management. Although our results are limited by the nature of the retrospective study, we believe that in the absence of randomized controlled trials, our findings should be considered seriously when recommending simultaneous Spx for patients with HCC, CSPH, particularly for patients with thrombocytopenia who are planned to undergo major hepatectomy.\nSupplementary information", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

To achieve an improved 5-year survival rate among all patients with PDAC, it is crucial to improve the long-term survival of patients with UR-PDAC. Although recent progress in chemotherapeutic approaches has provided an improved short-term prognosis in these patients, the longer term prognosis continues to disappoint, with a median survival of 8 to 12 months.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5,6,7,8]</u> Long-term survival is rarely achieved in patients with UR-PDAC.

Tumor shrinkage or downstaging to (borderline) resectable (BR) disease can lead to an increased number of candidates for pancreatectomy with margin-negative resection as the only chance for long-term survival. One could argue that conversion to resectability represents the ultimate goal of treatment in UR-PDAC.\nIn this review, additional surgical resection during multimodal treatment, such as chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy, is defined as \"conversion surgery (CS),\" which is clearly different from planned surgical resection following neoadjuvant therapy for resectable (R) or BR PDAC.

UR-PDAC is subclassified according to the status of distant metastasis—locally advanced disease (UR-LA) and metastatic disease (UR-M), such as distant organ metastasis and non-regional lymph node metastasis.

The resectability classification, consisting solely of anatomical findings based on CT imaging, includes the categories of UR-M, as distant metastasis including non-regional lymph node metastasis, and UR-LA, as 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> tumor contact or invasion of the portal vein (PV)/superior mesenteric vein (SMV) of 180 or more degrees or occlusion of the PV/SMV exceeding the inferior border of the duodenum; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> tumor contact or invasion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and/or celiac artery (CA) of 180 or more degrees, tumor contact or invasion of the common hepatic artery (CHA) showing tumor contact or invasion of the proper hepatic artery (PHA) and/or CA; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> tumor contact or invasion of the aorta. Moreover, the international consensus statement of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) proposed a new definition of PDAC resectability, concerning not only the anatomic relationship between the tumor and the vessels, but also the biological and conditional dimensions.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> In this statement, UR-PDAC was defined as 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> bilateral narrowing/occlusion of the SMV/PV, exceeding the inferior border of the duodenum; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> tumor contact/invasion of 180 or more degrees to the SMA/CA; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> tumor contact/invasion of the CHA showing tumor contact/invasion of the PHA and/or CA in UR-LA, and distant metastasis including macroscopic para-aortic and extraabdominal lymph node metastasis in UR-M.\nGenerally, a surgery-first approach has not been justified in patients with UR-PDAC due to the high frequency of mortality and morbidity and poor prognosis. The indication for CS definitely varies among centers and most articles do not clarify it. In my institution, it is as follows: (A) downstaging to the BR or R status (sometimes UR on imaging study), (B) decreased tumor marker level, (C) maintained performance status, and (D) a time interval of 8 months or longer between initial treatments and CS.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> For the most part, it is easy to define the indication for CS in patients with tumor remission to R disease, a dramatic decrease in tumor markers, and maintained performance status, as suggested by anatomical, biological, and conditional indications in the IAP consensus meeting.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> The extension of the tumor toward the vascular structures is of utmost importance for the definition of local resectability and the decision for surgery. Even after a favorable response to multimodal treatment, a low-density area may still remain around major arteries, such as the SMA and CA on contrast-enhanced CT imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging may be useful for selecting patients who qualify for complete surgical resection and have a promising prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> In this situation, the indication for CS can change due to the attitude toward surgical resection. Conventional imaging fails to predict tumor response, and even if imaging remains unchanged, in many patients, a resection may be possible. Hackert通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> suggested that from the surgical point of view, exploration after completion of neoadjuvant treatment should be performed in all patients with stable disease or obvious tumor response in restaging, and only patients with clear progression should be excluded from undergoing surgery. In a national audit conducted by the Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, among 58 patients who underwent CS, it was found that a time interval of 8 months or longer between initial treatment and surgical resection was closely associated with the improved survival.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> A longer duration of anti-cancer treatment, although not based on high-level evidence, may be associated with better patient selection, greater doses of chemotherapy, a higher rate of partial response/complete response, and lower levels of tumor markers, thus resulting in a superior outcome in patients with initially UR-PDAC, since a certain period of observation allows for the identification of progressive disease or poor surgical candidates. In this analysis, the chemotherapy regimens contained gemcitabine or S-1 but not FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine+ nab-paclitaxel, which had better response rate. Recent chemotherapy regimens, not only for UR-M but also for UR-LA, provided better response rates and overall survival. However, FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine+ nab-paclitaxel are associated with a high frequency of severe adverse events, which may prohibit long term, continuous administration of chemotherapy. Thus, we must reappraise the optimal timing of CS after the use of modern chemotherapy regimens. Asano et al通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> proposed indications for CS for patients with initially UR-PDAC as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> treatment effect, such as stable disease, partial response, or complete response by a time interval of 6 months or more; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> possible R0 resection; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> possible complete resection of distant M lesions showing no progression. The indication for CS remains vague and controversial. Taking anatomical, biological, and conditional dimensions and optimal timing into consideration, a definitive indication should be explored in the near future. The indication for CS should be carefully decided in a multidisciplinary meeting, and its content should be communicated to the patient and family members.\nClinical features of patients who underwent CS are summarized in Table 1. Resectability ranged from 20% to 57% in patients with initially UR-LA,通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]</u> and from 2% to 24% in patients with initially UR-M.通用删除6(英):<u>[27,28,29]</u> Hackert et al通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> conducted currently the largest retrospective study on CS after various regimens of chemo(radiation) therapy, which contained 575 initially UR-PDAC patients on radiological imaging, including 135 occult distant organ metastases (23.5%). The most effective treatment option was FOLFIRINOX, with a secondary resection rate of 61%, compared with 47% after gemcitabine and radiation and 52% after other treatment schemes. Recent meta-analyses通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u> indicated that a FOLFIRINOX-based regimen for UR-PDAC showed a large heterogeneity of resectability rates, ranging from 0% to 43%, and of R0 resection rates, varying from 55% to 100%. The differences in resectability rates among the published articles may be explained by the fact that the number of patients with initially UR-LA might not reflect the actual population, because all of the patients with initially UR-LA did not come directly to the academic or university hospital, and patient selection could have been done in community hospitals.\nClinical outcomes in patients with initially unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent conversion surgery.\n删除重复语句：<u>Clinical outcomes in patients with initially unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent conversion surgery.</u>\nA = arterial resection, FOLFIRINOX = fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, FP = 5FU+ CDDP, GEM = gemcitabine, LA = locally advanced, M = metastasis, MST = median survival time, NA = not available, PM = peritoneal metastasis, PTX = paclitaxel, PV = portal vein resection, RT = radiotherapy, UR = unresectable.* 1% (30-day mortality) and 4% (90-day mortality). † MST from surgical resection.\nOnce CS was performed, the proportion of vascular resection varied from 8.3% to 69%.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]</u> The proportion of patients with UR-LA who underwent vascular resection was higher than those with UR-M, because the UR-M group included a high proportion of patients with R-PDAC. Moreover, the indication for vascular resection varies among centers. Pathological findings after CS revealed a high proportion of margin-negative resection (27%–91%), and negative lymph nodes (29%–83%),通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]</u> which were related to long-term survival, even in patients with initially UR-PDAC. These results encourage patients with a favorable response to anti-cancer treatments to undergo surgical resection, even if extended pancreatectomy is required.\nThese patients mostly experienced cancer-related symptoms and adverse events induced by chemo(radiation) therapy for a long time. Moreover, CS frequently requires extended pancreatectomy such as vein or arterial resection, which can be associated with increased mortality and morbidity.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Recent articles reported that mortality rates after CS range from 0% to 7%, and most articles reported no mortality, despite a high proportion of vascular resection or other organ resections.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]</u> Morbidity ranged from 30% to 62%, which was consistent with morbidity in patients with BR or R-PDAC who underwent planned pancreatectomy.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]</u> Actually, since these patients potentially have subclinical organ dysfunction induced by advanced cancer or long-term chemotherapy, CS for such patients should be done with a great caution by experienced surgeons in specialized centers.\nSurvival outcomes from several articles are summarized in Table 1. The median time from initial treatment to surgical resection ranged from 5 to 12 months. The median survival time (MST) from initial treatment or diagnosis ranged from 19.5 to 64 months in patients who underwent CS, which was significantly higher than those in patients who did not undergo CS, and seemed to be consistent with the MST in patients with R-PDAC.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]</u> The major proportion of patients with initially UR-PDAC who underwent CS were classified as UR-LA, not UR-M. The recent progress in chemotherapeutic approaches led to an increased number of patients who could undergo CS, even for patients with initially UR-M, after introduction of a new chemotherapeutic regimen, such as FOLFORINX or gemcitabine+ nab-paclitaxel.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,22,23,24,25,26,27,30,31]</u> The MST varied between 24.9 and 35.3 months for patients with UR-LA,通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21,22,23,24,25]</u> 19.5 and 64 months for patients with UR-LA/M,通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18,19,26]</u> and 26 and 56 months for patients with UR-M.通用删除6(英):<u>[27,28,29]</u> The Panc-01 study organized by the Japanese Society for Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Surgery revealed that the overall survival rates in patients who underwent CS at 1, 3, and 5 years were 95%, 53%, and 34%, respectively, and the MST was 39.7 months, which was significantly better than 88%, 18%, and 10%, respectively, and a MST of 20.8 months in patients who did not undergo CS.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Asano et al通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> also reported an excellent survival outcome in 34 patients with initially UR-PDAC who had a MST of 5.3 years and an actual 5-year overall survival rate of 47.4% after initial treatment. One of the most challenging indications of CS is for patients with UR-M, such as liver or peritoneal metastasis. Frigerio et al通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> also reported a MST after initial treatment of 56 months in 24 patients with initially UR-M with liver metastases who underwent CS. Recently, we conducted a phase II multicenter study to investigate the clinical effects of S-1 combined with intravenous and intraperitoneal paclitaxel in patients with PDAC with peritoneal metastasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Surprisingly, 8 of 33 patients underwent CS after confirmed disappearance of peritoneal dissemination and negative peritoneal washing cytology.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> This new regimen achieved a 24% rate of resectability and a MST of 26 months in patients with peritoneal metastasis who underwent CS.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Thus, after surgical resection was performed, survival results did not differ between patients with UR-LA and UR-M. Therefore, CS should not be avoided, even in patients with UR-M if they meet the criteria for surgery.\nAlthough many kinds of chemotherapy were used in the previous studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]</u> a few reported a clinical effect of type of chemotherapy on the surgical outcome in patients who underwent CS. Bednar et al通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> reported that use of FOLFIRNOX and/or gemcitabine+ nab-paclitaxel was associated with improved survival compared with older chemotherapy regimens, regardless of eventual resection. Hackert et al通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> compared OS in 575 patients with radiographically defined UR-LA according to type of chemotherapy, such as FOLFIRINOX (n= 125), gemcitabine + radiation (n = 322), and other regimens (n = 128). The most effective treatment option was FOLFIRINOX, with a secondary resection rate of 61%, compared with 47% after gemcitabine and radiation and 52% after other treatment schemes, respectively. Following resection, the MST was 16 months; combined with an average 5 to 6 months of treatment time, this adds up to 21 to 22 months. No significant difference in OS in patients who underwent CS was found according to type of chemotherapy, but it was significantly better than the MST of 6.5 months in patients who did not undergo surgical resection. These results showed that the type of chemotherapy did not have an influence on postoperative survival. After a patient is converted to a R stage and CS is performed, similar survival results were achieved postoperatively.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> It was concluded that FOLFIR-INOX is the most effective regimen to achieve secondary resectability, and consequently, to increase the pool of patients who can undergo pancreatectomy after a primary diagnosis of unresectability.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Full administration of this regimen seems to be limited to patients with sufficient performance status. An appropriate treatment regimen with high response rates and a low rate of adverse events should be explored.\nWhen investigating a clinical benefit of CS, the early recurrence rate should be taken into consideration. Wright et al通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> only reported that median OS from diagnosis reached 34.1 months in 23 patients with UR-M who underwent CS following a favorable response to systemic chemotherapy using FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based regimens. However, 7 of 23 patients (30.4%) experienced early disease recurrence <6 months from surgery. The site of recurrence was the same as the initial M disease in 13 of 17 (76.5 %) patients who had recurrent disease during the observation period. The early recurrence (<6 months) rate in patients with R/BR who underwent margin-negative resection was 20% to 30%, which was consistent with that after CS. However, the early recurrence rate should be decreased as much as possible in patients who undergo CS. CS is an additional surgery during multimodal treatment in patients with initially UR-PDAC. Mortality, severe morbidity, and early recurrence within 6 months may give the patient and family discomfort. Surrogate markers for predicting early recurrence should be explored.\nPatients with initially UR-PDAC who underwent CS experienced better MST and long-term survival relative to patients who did not or could not undergo CS. From the survival point of view, a MST of at least 24 months after surgical resection and less than a 20% incidence of early recurrence may be required for obtaining a clinical benefit of CS in the modern era. Otherwise, CS may be just a surgical injury for patients with initially UR-PDAC, because extended pancreatectomy has high risk of mortality and morbidity. Although CS could be performed safely without increased mortality and morbidity in the previous studies, it should be done with great caution by experienced surgeons in specialized centers. The previous studies specifically selected patients at the initial detection of progressive disease during multimodal treatment and at the detection of occult distant organ metastasis during surgical exploration. Moreover, patients with poor performance status were also excluded from the process of anti-cancer treatments. The patients who underwent CS may be regard as \"super-responders\" to anti-cancer treatments. This retrospective patient selection process is one of the major limitations in the previous studies. In other words, patient selection considering anatomical, biological, and conditional factors is definitely required for achieving improved survival. Thus far, no surrogate marker has been found for predicting prognosis, and further efforts will be needed to identify appropriate patients for CS.\nIn terms of multimodal treatment, the applied treatment protocols differ to a great extent among reports. From the previous publications, a definitive regimen was not clearly obtained. Although type of chemo(radiation) therapy did not affect postoperative survival, the FOLFIRINOX regimen can increase the proportion of candidates for CS. An appropriate regimen with a high response rate and a low rate of adverse events is definitely required for increasing the number of candidates for CS.\nIn addition, the optimal timing between initial treatment and surgical resection, an accurate method to evaluate tumor remission, and the type/duration of adjuvant treatment regimen are still under investigation.\nIn summary, the number of candidates for CS is now increasing with the introduction of modern chemotherapy regimens; however, the actual clinical benefits of resection have not yet been fully investigated. CS can be the important key to open the door for improving long-term survival in patients with UR-PDAC. There are still several issues to be resolved in this area. Therefore, prospective studies will be needed to explore the clinical benefit of CS. The study group for pre-operative therapy for pancreatic cancer (PREP) has conducted a prospective cohort study of resectability, safety, and efficacy for CS in patients with initially UR-PDAC responding to anti-cancer treatment (clinical trial registration number: UMIN000017793). A group at Johns Hopkins is now conducting a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II trial to investigate intensified neoadjuvant chemotherapy in LA pancreatic cancer . Scientific evidence will be provided from the results of these prospective studies in the near future.\nNone.\n删除重复语句：<u>None.</u>\nNone.\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The molecular imaging probe consists of three components: a signal agent that produces the imaging signal, a component with high affinity to the target, and a linker that connects the affinity component and signal agent.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> An ideal molecular imaging probe with clinical transformation potential should have high affinity, strong specificity, high sensitivity, high imaging contrast, low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and strong stability in vivo.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Hence, molecular imaging probes require a suitable affinity component. Although monoclonal antibodies are most widely used as affinity components in molecular imaging probes, their large molecular weights (150 kD) limit the penetration depth of the probe in tumors.

Non-systematic reviews include English experimental articles and review articles from January 1999 to July 2020. We use the following search strategy to search the PubMed database and other databases to obtain relevant literature. First, through searching for the 2 keywords of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and biomarkers in the reference list included in the study, the 8 markers overexpressed on the membrane of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were determined. After searching for the 2 keywords of nanobody and molecular imaging, the author determined some of the articles by screening the titles and abstracts of the articles, and then screened the keywords of eight markers, namely EGFR, HER2, HER3, c-Met, VEGFR2, CXCR-4, CXCR-7, and CEA. The data extraction process focuses on the application of nanobodies for PET imaging, following by the application of nanobodies for antitumor drugs.

An in vitro stability study revealed that both probes were stable in buffer at 4°C and in serum at 37°C.

Moreover, radiolabeling did not affect the binding properties of the sdAb to EGFR. 99mTc-D10 was injected into a subcutaneous human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) mouse model, whereby it accumulated in tumors . Imaging revealed small tumors with an average volume of 26.6 mm3 . Meanwhile, 99mTc-Cetuximab detected an average volume of 40 mm3 for small tumors. Collectively, these results indicated that probes with an sdAb can detect small tumors at the earliest time point, improving the overall prognosis of patients. Therefore, the 99mTc-D10 anti-EGFR probe can be used for clinical non-invasive diagnosis not only to detect small tumors, but also obtain information about EGFR expression levels during diagnosis and disease progression.\nHER2 is the most popular target for tumor therapy. It has been confirmed that HER2 is highly expressed in ESCC tumor cell membranes, and this high expression is related to the progression of ESCC.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Moreover, HER2 expression is higher in patients with local relapses or distant metastases early after surgery compared with other patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Therefore, HER2 can be used as a target for the diagnosis and treatment of ESCC.\nXavier et al通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> confirmed that anti-HER2 sdAb 2Rs15d features high tumor uptake and low background signal. The sdAb-based tracer 68Ga-NOTA-2Rs15d could bind to the HER2 target protein with low-nanomolar affinity and showed high metabolic stability in human plasma. Moreover, 68Ga-NOTA-2Rs15d was shown to specifically bind to HER2-positive SK-OV-3 cells. Biodistribution results showed relatively high radioactive absorption in HER2-positive tumors , and the tumor-to-muscle ratio of HER2-positive tumors was significantly higher than that of HER2-negative tumors.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> Finally, PET/CT imaging studies revealed strong tracer uptake in HER2-positive tumors, while mouse toxicity and dosimetry studies demonstrated the safety of this tracer.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> Therefore, similar sdAb-based tracers can be used for clinical diagnosis of ESCC.\nIn 2016, Vaidyanathan et al通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> reported that the anti-HER2 sdAb 18F-RL-I-5F7 can specifically target tumors positively expressing HER2, and features high tumor uptake and normal tissue clearance rates. Internalization of the sdAb-based tracer revealed that an sdAb labeled with RL-1 can effectively retain radioactivity. A biodistribution study of 18F-RL-I-5F7 showed that tumor uptake increased from 29.0 ± 3.9% ID/g at 1hour to 36.3 ± 14.1% ID/g at 2 hours.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> Micro-PET/CT imaging showed high tumor uptake at both time points, whereas significant uptake was not observed in other normal organs with the exception of kidney and bladder .通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> Tumor uptake of 18F-RL-I-5F7 could be reduced by over 90% through pre-injection of trastuzumab .通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> The results of this study indicate that 18F-RL-1-5F7 can be used to image tumors positively expressing HER2. However, the problem of excessive kidney uptake remains to be resolved\nHER3 plays important roles in tumor growth, differentiation, and metastasis. Unlike EGFR and HER2, HER3 does not directly promote the proliferation of tumor cells; instead, HER3 binding to heregulin led to the formation of HER2 heterodimers able to activate signaling pathways.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> In addition to HNSCC, HER3 is also highly expressed in ESCC.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Therefore, an anti-HER3 sdAb can be designed in combination with other antibodies for the diagnosis and treatment of ESCC.\nWarnders et al通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> developed and demonstrated the sustained anti-tumor activity of a biparatopic sdAb construct, MSB0010853, that could bind to two different HER3 epitopes. Biodistribution of MSB0010853 in the body could be non-invasively monitored through PET imaging.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> The construct was composed of albumin and two sdAbs that bound to different HER3 epitopes. Biodistribution results revealed that an injection dose of 25 mg yielded the best tumor uptake (5.7% ID/g), and tumor uptake of 89Zr-MSB0010853 peaked  within 24 hours and thereafter decreased. PET imaging showed that 89Zr-MSB0010853 in positive tumors remained clearly visible 96 hours after injection . Moreover, radioactive absorptions of HER3-positive tumors H441  were 2.4 greater than that of the HER3-negative tumor Calu-1 (2.3 ± 0.3% ID/g) and FaDu (5.1 ± 0.4% ID/g) were 2.2 times greater than that of Calu-1 . The half-life of albumin in humans is longer than in mice, thus 89Zr-MSB0010853 is expected to have a longer circulation time and show sustained anti-tumor activity in humans. This research provides new ideas for the development of drugs for the treatment of ESCC.\nThe hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (c-Met) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in a variety of tumor cells,通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> including ESCC.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> When combined with HGF, c-Met undergoes autophosphorylation and causes cell growth, invasion, and metastasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> Therefore, this receptor is a promising target for tumor treatment.\nBased on previously designed anti-EGFR nanobody-albumin nanoparticles (NANAPs),通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> Heukers et al通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> synthesized a type of albumin nanoparticles decorated with an sdAb targeting c-Met (G2-PEG-NP) in 2013. Their results showed that G2-PEG-NP could inhibit tumor growth, making it potentially suitable for intracellular drug delivery and targeted medicine. Moreover, G2-PEG-NP could specifically bind to cells expressing c-Met. Scratch wound experiments revealed that G2-PEG-NP did not cause cell migration. When HGF and G2-PEG-NP acted together on cells, cell migration induced by HGF was significantly inhibited, suggesting that G2-PEG-NP could potentially inhibit tumor growth. The results of co-staining revealed that internalized G2-PEG-NP was located first in early endosomes and finally in lysosomes. In addition, both nanoparticles and c-Met receptors were degraded during the late stage. Therefore, anti-c-Met NANAPs may be suitable for intracellular delivery and release of therapeutic compounds. Given its characteristics, this type of targeted nanoparticle may be a good candidate for the treatment of tumors overexpressing c-Met.\nVEGFR2, also known as FLK-1, is a subtype of VEGFR that exists in blood vessels and the lymphatic endothelium. Binding of VEGFR2 by VEGF promotes the formation of blood vessels and enhances the invasion and infiltration of tumors. This receptor is highly expressed in a variety of tumor cells, including ESCC, and has thus become a popular target for tumor therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>\nIn 2017, Tian et al通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> developed an sdAb-conjugate, V21-DOS47, capable of specifically binding VEGFR2 to deliver drugs to target sites to inhibit angiogenesis. V21-DOS47 kills cells expressing VEGFR2 by inducing cytotoxic activity in the target cell; this method differs from most anti-angiogenic agents. V21-DOS47 has high purity, and binding affinity experiments revealed that V21H4-DOS47 binds to VEGFR2 with approximately five-times higher affinity than V21H1-DOS47. Moreover, V21H4-DOS47 was found to exclusively bind to VEGFR2. Above all, this sdAb-conjugate appears to be a promising anti-cancer drug. With regard to ESCC, this conjugate may be constructed to direct drug delivery to the target site to reduce non-specific side effects.\nCXCR4, a chemokine receptor, is a transmembrane G proteincoupled receptor. Similar to CXCR7, CXCR4 is a receptor for the chemokine CXCL12, which can induce chemotaxis and enhance intracellular calcium, proliferation, and gene transcription.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> Studies have shown that CXCR4 may be highly expressed in ESCC, with a total expression rate of 61%.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Therefore, synthesis of an sdAb targeting CXCR4 may be useful to diagnose and treat ESCC.\nJähnichen et al通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> synthesized the anti-CXCR4 sdAbs 238D2 and 238D4 in 2010, and found that the biparatopic sdAb could both inhibit the response induced by CXCL12 and act as an inverse agonist, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Radioactive 125I-labeled 238D2 and 238D4 were discovered to selectively bind to CXCR4-positive cells. Functional characterization of 238D2 and 238D4 showed that the sdAb could completely inhibit the accumulation of inositol phosphate induced by CXCL12, and these antagonistic effects increased with increasing concentrations of anti-CXCR4 sdAb. Importantly, the anti-CXCR4 biparatopic sdAb exhibited high affinity and antagonistic properties at picomolar concentrations. Moreover, the anti-CXCR4 sdAb was found to act as fast and effectively as stem cell mobilizers.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> Therefore, anti-CXCR4 sdAbs may provide a new route for the development of therapeutic agents for CXCR4-related diseases.\nCXCR7 can bind to chemokines and is a newly identified receptor for CXCL12, which plays a key role in the occurrence and progression of liver, esophagus, head and neck, and other cancers.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> CXCR7 can act as a co-receptor of CXCR4 or interact with β-arrestin.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> Therefore, treatment of ESCC may be achieved by constructing an sdAb targeting CXCR7.\nMaussang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> demonstrated that CXCR7 is highly expressed in HNSCC, indicating that CXCR7 has potential tumorigenic effects in HNSCC. Thus, they developed an anti-CXCR7 sdAb and showed that an anti-CXCR7 multivalent sdAb could effectively inhibit angiogenic factor secretion and tumor growth. Moreover, they confirmed that the sdAbs NB2 and NB3 (with strong binding) could effectively inhibit the recruitment of β-arrestin2 induced by CXCL12, and exerted effective antagonistic effects, whereas sdAb NB1 (with weak binding) could not. Competitive binding assays revealed that the binding epitopes of NB2 and NB3 differed from that of NB1. Compared with a monovalent sdAb, the affinity of NB4 [NB1 and NB3 combined through serum albumin (Alb8)] and NB5 (NB2 conjugated to Alb8) for CXCR7 was significantly increased, and they could similarly inhibit the recruitment of β-arrestin2 induced by CXCL12. Interestingly, NB4 was approximately 10 times more potent than NB5. In vitro experiments confirmed that NB4 could inhibit secretion of the angiogenic factor CXCL1, but did not inhibit the cell cycle process.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> An investigation of therapeutic potential in vivo showed that the tumors of mice treated with NB4 grew more slowly and were significantly smaller in size than phosphate buffer saline-injected mice; moreover, NB4 was confirmed to be non-toxic.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> The anti-CXCR7 sdAb could inhibit CXCL12-induced β-arrestin2 recruitment, and the multivalent sdAb had higher affinity and greater inhibitory effects than the monovalent sdAb, thus establishing a new option for the development of anti-tumor drugs.\nCEA, a member of the immunoglobulin molecule family expressed on the cell surface,通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u> is a broad-spectrum tumor marker that is highly expressed in a variety of colon, gastric, pancreatic, and non-small-cell lung cancers,通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> as well as ESCC.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> CEA is expressed during the fetal period and then becomes quite limited in healthy adults, although it is re-expressed in cancer. Therefore, CEA has become a popular target for cancer therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>\nIn 2010, Vaneycken et al通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> constructed a humanized sdAb (NbCEA5) and found that this sdAb-based tracer features high specificity for tumor targeting, rapid renal clearance, and a low background signal. Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results revealed this humanized sdAb can specifically bind to CEA with a high binding capacity. 99mTc-humanized CEA5 grafts could effectively bind purified CEA protein and CEA-expressing CHO cells in vitro. Blood clearance rates and pinhole SPECT/Micro-CT of the 99mTc-sdAb showed high tumor uptake of 99mTc-NbCEA5 (7.09 ± 1.36% IA/cm3) and 99mTc-labeled humanized CEA5 grafts  at 1hour after injection. The tumor-to-muscle ratios of NbCEA5 (39.25 ± 27.64) and humanized sdAb (7.74 ± 3.05) were generally high. Collectively, these results indicated excellent clinical application potential of anti-CEA sdAbs for the detection of ESCC.\nAlthough sdAbs have been widely used in molecular imaging on account of their high conformational stability, high tolerance to the environment, and easy synthesis, some problems continue to hinder their clinical applications. The following sections briefly introduce these problems and describe possible solutions.\nThe kidney is the main metabolic organ for sdAb-based tracers and takes in high radiation doses, so it may cause nephrotoxicity and reduce the sensitivity of detecting specific molecular signals near the esophagus.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> Research conducted to address this issue found relatively low accumulation of kidney radioactivity in mice lacking megalin.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> Co-injection of lysine or gelatin serine with the tracer also appeared to reduce kidney uptake.通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u> After removal of the histidine tag from an sdAb-based tracer, the tracer retention rate in the kidney was greatly decreased because the pH in the kidney was lower than the pKa of imidazole. Differences in the total charge of an sdAb can be used to explain why histidine tag removal reduces kidney retention.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>\nsdAbs are widely used because of their small size. However, their characteristic rapid elimination is not conducive to treatment effectiveness. Thus, it is necessary to increase the half-life of sdAbs without affecting their characteristics to achieve effective treatments. Binding of an sdAb to albumin to form a multivalent sdAb may be used to extend its half-life.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> Multivalent sdAbs exhibit faster and deeper tumor penetration compared with monoclonal antibodies. Coupling with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker has also been attempted.通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> These methods can effectively extend the half-life of sdAbs to increase the residence time of the drug in the blood, thus permitting lower doses of the drug to be injected and extending the interval between infusions. This provides a new idea for sdAbs to become clinical anti-tumor drugs.通用删除6(英):<u>[56,57]</u>\nEndoscopy is very easy to access the esophagus, so early diagnosis of esophageal cancer is possible, and significant progress has been made.通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u> Therefore, fluorescent-labeled sdAbs can be used to detect ESCC. Some studies have used quantum dots to label sdAbs targeting tumor markers. The resulting materials can detect not only primary tumors, but also tumor cells and micrometastatic lesions in different organs with high brightness and sensitivity.通用删除6(英):<u>[59,60]</u> An sdAb labeled with the near-infrared fluorophore IRDye800CW could clearly identify tumors during operation. Compared with mice injected with a control probe, the TBR of this antibody was clearly higher.通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> Massa et al通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u> linked the fluorescent dye Cy5 to an sdAb and visualized HER2-expressing tumors in vivo with high contrast and specificity 1 hour after injection. Fluorescent-labeled sdAbs have been widely used to detect various tumors. Non-invasive or minimally invasive examinations can be performed using endoscopy to detect ESCC. Therefore, fluorescent-labeled sdAbs have great application prospects as ESCC markers and can be developed for clinical diagnosis.\nThis article focuses on the application of single-domain antibodies in radiological imaging, briefly mentioning the application in fluorescence imaging, and there is little discussion of single-domain antibodies that have been used in clinical practice. Recently review has compiled sdAb currently in clinical trials, among them, only anti-HER2 sdAb have reference significance for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>\nMolecular probes containing an sdAb can specifically bind to the target antigen; be radioactively labeled for PET, SPECT/CT, or PET/CT imaging; and be labeled for fluorescent imaging, yielding high diagnostic accuracy. Molecular imaging studies have shown that probes containing an sdAb have higher tumor-to-background ratios, and most sdAb tracers exhibit the best imaging results within 1 to 3 hours. The signal ratio of tumor-to-normal-tissue was 5-36. The sdAb exhibited rapid blood elimination efficiency and final metabolism by the kidney or liver, and the half-life of the probe was 30 to 143.5 minutes in vivo.通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u> The results of single-dose intravenous toxicity studies on sdAb-based tracers indicated good compatibility of this type of probe.\nAlthough sdAb-based probes are widely used, the following problems still need to be solved. First, sdAb-based tracers exhibit high renal uptake and fast clearance rates. At present, coinjection of lysine and gelatin serine with tracers, or removal of histidine tags, has been identified as methods to decrease renal uptake. In addition, short metabolism times in vivo can be prolonged by formation of a multivalent sdAb, or coupling with albumin or a PEG linker. Second, sdAb-based fluorescent probes can help clinicians clearly observe tumor edges during endoscopic diagnosis, but labeling with a fluorescent group may affect the structure of the sdAb.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Studies have shown that specific amino acid sequences of an sdAb can be recognized by enzymes, thus allowing the sdAb to be selectively enzyme-catalyzed and modified with a fluorescent group.通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> In addition, sdAbs can be singly and specifically labeled by orthogonal reactions.\nAs an important technical means for tumor diagnosis, molecular imaging technology has broad prospects and plays a pivotal role in accurate tumor diagnosis. The demand for new molecular imaging probes with clinical advantages is becoming increasingly apparent. sdAbs are used as molecular probes in tumor diagnosis and treatment with the advantages of good penetration, high affinity, and low immunogenicity. With the emergence of highly specific, targeted, sdAb probes, new molecular probes employing an sdAb core are expected to provide novel strategies for precise diagnosis and treatment of ESCC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The results were correlated with lymphatic vessel invasion, lymphatic node metastasis, the number of matastatic lymphatic nodes, and venous invasion. Propidium iodide (PI) was used as a fluorescent probe for total cellular DNA, and a monoclonal antibody against BrdUrd was used as a probe for BrdUrd incorporated into DNA. Fluorescent-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody was used as a second antibody. S-phase fractions were measured by in vitro BrdUrd labeling, and DNA ploidy and G2/MPF were also measured. Comparison of survival was performed with the log-rank test, the Chi-square test for qualitative data, and Student's t test for quantu data.\n\n【2】Results\nBrdUrd LI and G2/MPF values were significantly higher in tumors with lymphatic vessel invasion than in those without invasion respectively (P &lt;0. 01); the patients who had tumors with lymphatic vessel invasion showed a significantly poor prognosis (P &lt; 0. 01). Both BrdUrd LI and G2/MPF values were significantly higher in tumors with lymphatic node metastasis than in those without metastasis (P &lt;0. 01). A statistical significant difference was noted in the 5-year survival rates between the patients with lymph node metastasis and those without metastasis. Compared with diploid carcinoma, the incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in aneuploid carcinoma (P &lt; 0. 05), and the patients with aneuploid carcinoma showed a significantly poor prognosis (P &lt;0. 05).

However, the outcome of nephritis and uveitis can be different, making the diagnosis challenging. TINU syndrome usually shows bilateral anterior uveitis and may evolve into a chronic disease, or it recurs years after the first episode.4 Renal disease shows an acute onset and resolves spontaneously with full recovery or evolves into chronic renal insufficiency.\nWe describe the case of a 7-year-old girl (stature 121 cm; weight: 23 kg; Tanner stage: PH1, B1), admitted, during the COVID-19 pandemic, for persistent fever and bilateral red eyes, photophobia, eye pain. The nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in two different swabs. The swab for other respiratory viruses was negative. The anamnestic records excluded previous kidney and ocular diseases. The ophthalmologist diagnosed bilateral, anterior uveitis and prescribed 0.1% dexamethasone eye drops, tapered over a 2-week period until the resolution. She showed nocturia, polyuria, and polydipsia. Fourteen days after the end of steroid treatment and a negative swab, she showed a relapse of uveitis, with a reduction of visual acuity in the right eye (4/10), ipsilateral conjunctival hyperemia, bilateral iris-capsular synechiae, papilledema and macular edema. The optical computerized tomography confirmed the diagnosis. The encephalic computerized axial tomography was negative, and the magnetic resonance showed a bilateral slight distension of the retrobulbar area peri-optic nerve sheath. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal chemical-physical examination and cell count, negative PCR analysis for viruses and microbic agents, concordance between the CSF and serum bands, excluding an intrathecal production of immunoglobulin G (IgG). The human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-B27, -B51, -B57, lymphocyte subpopulation analysis, autoimmune tests, anti-N-methy-l-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA), anti-myeline olygoden-drocyte glycoprotein (MOG), anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies were negative. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were significantly increased (8080.7 AU/mL). She showed increased creatinine values, glycosuria, albuminuria, proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate of 60 ml·min-1·1.73 m-2, according to Schwartz’s formula. The diagnosis of tubulointerstitial nephritis was confirmed by the increased serum and urinary levels of tubular enzymes β2-microglobulin (6.4 mg/L; normal 0-0.23 mg/L), α1-microglobulin (31.6 mg/L; normal 0-12 mg/L), α2-macroglobulin (20.4 mg/L; normal 0-9.4 mg/L). She was treated with prednisone (1 mg·kg-1·d-1) for 1 month, a second course of topic 0.1% dexamethasone and mydriatics, with a gradual tapering.\nDuring the follow-up, creatinine and glomerular filtration rate normalized with uveitis remission. Three months after the steroids discontinuation, she showed a relapse of bilateral uveitis, treated with steroids (prednisone: 0.75 mg·kg-1·d-1) for one month, with a gradual tapering. Two months later, for a further relapse, she started anti-TNF-α treatment (adalimumab) (20 mg × 14 d), with the complete uveitis remission. The diagnosis of TINU syndrome was suggested by the outcome, characterized by the remission of tubulointerstitial nephritis and the relapsing uveitis, only partially responding to steroids.\nThe prevalence of TINU syndrome reported by uveitis centers, is 1.1%-2.3% in children,4 with differences linked to several factors, including TINU recognition, frequently underdiagnosed. The epidemiological and etiological data do not permit the real definition of genetic, HLA haplotype, epigenetic and environmental factors (infections, drugs) involved in the pathogenesis.删除4：<u>5</u>\nIt is essential to exclude systemic diseases that can trigger an overlap of ocular and renal inflammation, including Behçet disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, atypical Kawasaki disease, COVID-19, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).6,7,8,9,10,11 Ocular symptoms in adults with COVID-19 are polymorphous.3 Most of patients with MIS-C or with Kawasaki disease, show conjunctivitis, less frequently anterior uveitis or corneal punctate epitheliopathy.7,10,11 COVID-19-related uveitis underlies multifactorial pathogenetic mechanisms, which may involve virus-induced direct cytopathic effect; eyes thrombotic vasculopathy; the antigen mimicry between virus and self-antigens of the eyes, especially in patients with HLA-B27; and increased cytokine secretion, especially of TNF-α, IL-1, IL-18.删除4：<u>12</u>\nIn a recent case series, 66.6% patients with TINU developed renal and ocular involvement simultaneously, most a bilateral anterior uveitis, rarely a bilateral pan uveitis. Treatment with topical and systemic corticosteroids allowed a significant improvement of uveitis, no evolution to chronic kidney disease.13 A recent review on 592 TINU patients evidenced a females prevalence, with bilateral and anterior uveitis following nephritis. Children showed more uveitis relapses, less acute and chronic kidney disease, with a higher incidence of chronic kidney disease in posterior or pan uveitis.删除4：<u>14</u>\nThis case offered a diagnostic dilemma between a tubulointerstitial nephritis with relapsing uveitis secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and TINU syndrome. The clinical course suggested TINU. The increased levels of β2-microglobulin could be secondary to the autoimmune pathogenesis of TINU. The prompt diagnosis and treatment of uveitis allowed to prevent ocular complications and visual impairment. This is one of the few pediatric cases of TINU syndrome, associated with SARS-CoV-2.15 TINU syndrome has been reported in a few children with a strict contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, or with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or IgG. These data support that the pathogenesis of TINU is not secondary to virus-induced direct cytopathic effect but to the autoimmune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Autoantibodies are detected after COVID-19 and some patients develop autoimmune diseases. SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates self-tolerance and triggers autoimmune diseases, in part by the cross-reactivity of virus antigens with the host cells.16 The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows a high-affinity superantigen-like sequence motif near the S1/S2 cleavage site, with a high binding affinity with T-cell receptors (TCRs).17 An intriguing matter for study is whether SARS-CoV-2 induces transient or persistent autoimmunity and whether virus variants have different influences on autoimmunity. Cytokines secretion regulates the immune response, and acts as a trigger of autoimmune diseases secondary to COVID-19.18 The role of cytokines and autoimmunity explains the response to adalimumab in our patient, allowing the remission.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Nonetheless, multicellular plants and animals have highly polygenic phenotypes and large genomes, posing a challenge for RG in terms of genetic operation and unknown factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Due to their small genomes, microorganisms, particularly viruses, are relatively simple to operate and control using RG techniques.\nRepresentative applications of reverse genetics systems in various organisms.\n删除重复语句：<u>Representative applications of reverse genetics systems in various organisms.</u>\nEmerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have become prevalent in recent years. The pandemic COVID-19 warns that we know too little about these pathogens. Subsequently, it is urgent to comprehend the pathogenesis and transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other serious pathogens using advanced and efficient RG. In actuality, there are well-established and publicly accessible RG tools for studying SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]</u>, which leads to controversial opinions and even criticism due to their potential biosafety and biosecurity concerns. Increasing emphasis has been placed on the dual-use-concern (DURC) of RG in virology. This review focuses primarily on the application of RG in virology, including key events during RG development, the DURC of viral RG with an emphasis on biosafety and biosecurity, and the rational use of RG in virology.\nThe history of virus RG is not long, but its evolution has been accelerated by modern molecular biology techniques. There are numerous summaries of the historical process of virus RG 通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30,31,32]</u>. Here only pivotal events in the evolution of virus RG are reviewed briefly . Genes are the building blocks for a reverse genetics system (RGS). Therefore, the nucleotide sequence is a map that indicates where RG should go, and genetic engineering techniques are tools that help RG reach its destination. Immediately after the first complete genome was sequenced in 1976 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>, RG was created to generate hybrid viruses via recombination of SV40 and a DNA fragment from the lambda bacteriophage 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. Two years later, the infectious prokaryotic virus Qβ bacteriophage was first constructed by RG to study interactions between Qβ bacteriophage and its host E. coli 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>, indicating that it is possible to produce infectious viruses based on the whole genome sequence using RG.\nPoliovirus, one of the smallest viruses, attracted global concerns during the middle of the 20th century. In 1981, the whole genome sequence of poliovirus (single-stranded positive-sense RNA, 7500 bp) was determined for the first time 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>. In the same year, the first RGS in a eukaryotic virus, an infectious clone of poliovirus, was produced 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. This RGS significantly advances our understanding of poliovirus, which prompted the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health in 1985 to propose the goal of eradicating polio in the United States by 1990. Nevertheless, the global eradication of a virus was questioned because it was reported in 2002 that infectious virus particles can be obtained through chemical methods based on publicly available sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>.\nThe success of RG in poliovirus suggests that as long as we have the complete genome sequence, we can use RG techniques to rescue infectious viruses. The 10 kb genome of the yellow fever strain 17D (single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus) was successfully sequenced in 1985 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> due to the rapid development of sequencing technology. RGS of yellow fever virus was first established in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> using emerging molecular biology techniques such as PCR 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>, in-vitro transcription system, and liposome transfection based on this genomic sequence. Additionally, the influenza virus has a large genome with a single-stranded negative sense segmented RNA (8 segments, 13.5 kb). In the same year as the yellow fever virus, the influenza virus was engineered as a vector to successfully pack, amplify, and express a foreign gene; this is the first RGS found in influenza virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. In 1994, neurotropic Rabies virus (a single-stranded negative sense non-segmented RNA virus) was successfully rescued via RG in 1994 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> on the basis of the genome sequence of attenuated vaccine strain SAD B19 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. This is the first RG reported in a negative RNA virus. The RGS for the double-stranded segmented RNA virus (two segments) was established in infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in 1996 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>. In, RGS was also produced by the largest coronavirus, IBV, in 2001 通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u>. It has been demonstrated that RG applies to all types of RNA viruses, which is anticipated to make significant contributions to molecular virology.\nIn the 1990s, RG enters a period of continuous development and improvement. RGSs in other members of the Flaviviridae family, such as Dengue virus (DENV) 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) 通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u>, Tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) 通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>, Murray valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>, West Nile virus (WNV) 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>, and Zika virus (ZIKV) 通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>, have subsequently been established following the application of RG to Yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D. Using the genome of vaccine strain YFV 17D as the backbone, chimeric viruses of various viruses were also obtained through RG, providing a crucial platform for the development of safe and effective vaccines 通用删除6(英):<u>[53,54,55,56]</u>. During the initial early of RG in influenza virus, a helper virus is required to provide the RNP complex for virus assembly, which can interfere with the screening of the target virus and result in low efficiency. Using cellular RNA polymerase I to produce influenza virus vRNA is a breakthrough in the development of RGS 通用删除6(英):<u>[57,58]</u>. From that point on, the evolution of RGS in influenza virus went from 17-plasmid system, 12-plasmid system 通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>, 8-plasmid system 通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u>, and 2-plasmid system 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> to a 1-plasmid system. However, the 8-plasmid system is the most commonly used RGS for influenza viruses 通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u>. GS in rotavirus (11 segmented double-stranded RNA virus) has also undergone a lengthy procedure. In the first, RGS for rotavirus was established in 2006 using a helper virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u>. It took ten years to develop a solely plasmid-based RGS for rotavirus 通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u>. In 2020, an optimized 11 + 1 plasmid system (C3P3-G1 based RGS) had been constructed in rotavirus 通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u>. Coronaviruses present the most difficult RG due to their enormous genome (27-30 Kb), difficulties in the cloning process, and instability of cloned cDNA. Moreover, several advanced techniques, special vectors, and strategies, such as the bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC) vector 通用删除6(英):<u>[64,65,66,67,68,69,70]</u>, the in-vitro cDNA ligation 通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u>, the vaccinia virus vector 通用删除6(英):<u>[46,72]</u>, the yeast recombination system 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>, and the circular polymerase extension reaction strategy (CPER 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>), have been used to solve these issues.\nRGS had been established in all types of RNA viruses by the end of the 1990s. In 1995, there was an outbreak of the lethal Ebola virus Africa for a second time, resulting in ~300 deaths, which encourages the use of RG to study highly pathogenic viruses. In 2001, RGS was identified for the first time in the highly pathogenic Ebola virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u>, providing a useful platform and viral resource for gaining a comprehensive understanding of this pathogen. Recently, the RGS in Ebola virus has been enhanced 通用删除6(英):<u>[74,75]</u>, which is essential for studying the pathogenesis of Ebola virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[76,77]</u>. RGS had been successfully constructed in a series of BSL-4 pathogens (Marburg virus [MARV] 通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u>, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus [CCHFV] 通用删除6(英):<u>[79]</u>, and Nipah virus [NiV] 通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u>) and BSL-3 pathogens (West Nile virus [WNV] 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>, Chikungunya virus [CHIKV] 通用删除6(英):<u>[81]</u>, Rift Valley fever virus [RVFV] 通用删除6(英):<u>[82]</u>, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus [SARS-CoV] 通用删除6(英):<u>[83]</u>, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] 通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u>, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2] 通用删除6(英):<u>[84]</u>). Although RG for these highly pathogenic viruses contributes to the study of viral pathogenesis and antiviral R&D, biosafety and biosecurity concerns may arise. Due to the potential issues of biosafety and biosecurity, there have been several landmark events in the development of RG, such as the ectromelia virus expressing IL-4 engineered in 2001 通用删除6(英):<u>[85]</u>, chemical synthesis of polio in 2002 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> and Horsepox virus (HSPV) in 2018 通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u>, reconstruction of 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic virus in 2005 通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u>.\nThroughout the past five decades, RG has progressed from prokaryotic viruses to eukaryotic viruses, DNA viruses to RNA viruses, small viral genomes to large viral genomes, complex systems to simple systems, low-risk viruses to high-risk viruses, basic research to applied research, and gene amplification to synthetic biology. From a technical standpoint, the manipulation of viruses via RG is no longer regarded as a problem. Instead, it is concerned with biosafety and biosecurity issues resulting from the misuse or malicious use of viral RG.\nRG combined with advanced molecular tools, such as genetic modification, synthetic biology, and codon optimization by means of artificial intelligence, accelerates basic research in virology, production of the vaccine strain, research and development of an attenuated vaccine, and construction of viral vector. The target genes or sites can be modified via substitution, insertion, deletion, etc. followed by the reconstruction of an infectious virus. In cells or animals, the phenotypes or biological properties of modified viruses are analyzed to determine the functions of target genes or sites, including viral replication, infectivity, life cycle, and pathogenesis . In the first infectious virus, bacteriophage was rescued using RG1978 and used to study the mechanism of bacteriophage infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. RG was the first in eukaryotic viruses to reconstruct the infectious poliovirus, revealing that the first 115 bp fragment is required for the formation of infectious poliovirus 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. Then, RG was successfully used to screen or investigate essential gene fragments or residues involved in the interaction between virus and host 通用删除6(英):<u>[88,89]</u>, neutralizing epitopes 通用删除6(英):<u>[90,91]</u>, viral replication 通用删除6(英):<u>[92,93]</u>, inhibition of innate immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>[94,95]</u>, and pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[96,97]</u>. RG has been used extensively to investigate the gene functions of influenza viruses, including the transmissibility of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) in mammals 通用删除6(英):<u>[98,99]</u>. Chen Hualan’s team found that the G225W mutation in the HA of HPAIV H5N6 significantly reduces virulence 通用删除6(英):<u>[100]</u>. Via established RGS, they also identified key residues affecting the transmission of H7N9 among guinea pigs 通用删除6(英):<u>[101]</u>, as well as the crucial roles of 158-160 glycosylation of HA on H5N1 pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[102]</u>. The NP of the H7N9 influenza A virus regulates the TRAF3-mediated interferon signaling via the interaction between its PXXQXS motif and TRAF3 通用删除6(英):<u>[103]</u>. YFV is one of the earliest eukaryotic viruses for which RGS was established 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. Recent RG research on the virulent YFV strain Ap7 revealed that two amino acids (E/Q27 and E/D155) are necessary for its pathogenicity in hamsters 通用删除6(英):<u>[104]</u>. Rotavirus causes severe illnesses in children younger than five. Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) is the strain most commonly used in vaccines. RG research on rhesus rotavirus demonstrated that VP4 protein plays a role in the initial phase of rotavirus infection, possibly through the interaction of the amino acids SRL within the VP4-derived peptide TRTRVSRLY with Hsc70 通用删除6(英):<u>[105]</u>. The mutation of R446G in VP4 reduces the infectiousness of RRV in newborn mice 通用删除6(英):<u>[106]</u>. The 2＇-5 ＇-phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain mutant of rotavirus reconstructed by RG demonstrated decreased replication in vivo, indicating that VP3 of rotavirus plays crucial roles in viral replication and pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[93]</u>. Through RG, the non-structural protein (NS) of Heartland bandavirus (HRTV), an emerging tick-borne virus, has been identified as a virulent factor 通用删除6(英):<u>[107]</u>.\nSecondly, viruses containing reporters that have been reconstructed by RG are valuable screening tools for antiviral drugs. YFV vaccine strain 17D is frequently used as the backbone for the construction of recombinant viruses containing reporter luciferase. This platform has been used to screen drugs for YFV 通用删除6(英):<u>[108,109]</u>. The resistant infectious clone with the GFP reporter rescued by YAC-based RG is used to identify-two inhibitors of JEV replication 通用删除6(英):<u>[110]</u>. A recent drug development against filoviruses, such as Ebola virus (EBOV) and MARV, has involved the use of recombinant viruses expressing reporters that have been recently used for developing a drug against filoviruses, including EBOV 通用删除6(英):<u>[111,112]</u> and MARV 通用删除6(英):<u>[113,114]</u>. In addition to drug screening, the reporter virus made by RG can also be used to trace the viral distribution in vivo, particularly for neurotropic viruses 通用删除6(英):<u>[115,116,117,118,119]</u>.\nRG plus the published genomic sequences can make rare viruses as important resources for further studies, including recombinant virus, adaptive virus, hard-to-be-isolated virus, natural focal virus and eradicated virus. The recombination of RNA viruses may lead to alternation of viral host 通用删除6(英):<u>[120]</u>, enhanced virulence 通用删除6(英):<u>[121]</u>, evasion or escape of host immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>[122]</u>, and drug or vaccine resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>[123]</u>. Therefore, the recombinant viruses produced by RG can be used to study the naturally occurring recombinant viruses and identify potential antiviral drug targets 通用删除6(英):<u>[124,125,126]</u>. Norovirus is highly contagious and is easily transmitted through direct human-to-human contact. However, there is currently no efficient method of viral isolation for isolating human norovirus, impeding the study of viral biology. Since 2005, the successful establishment of RG for human norovirus has significantly aided the comprehension of the biology of human norovirus 通用删除6(英):<u>[127,128]</u>. Viruses resembling influenza A recently reported but not isolated from bats share some characteristics with influenza A virus but also have their own unique characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>[129]</u>. The influenza virus has been deciphered with the assistance of research on influenza A-like viruses derived from RG-made bats. The influenza virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[130]</u> that has been modified by RG to be adaptive in mice is a valuable evaluation tool for drug and vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>[131]</u>. The Ebola virus in West Africa, the Nipah virus in Malaysia, and the chikungunya virus in Southeast Asia are rare resources for virologists in other countries. RGS has been developed for these viruses to resolve the problem. The smallpox virus and the 1918 Spanish influenza viruses have been declared eradicated or extinct. Due to the limitations of science and technology in the past, there are still important questions to be answered. In the event of their re-emergence, we require these viruses for further research. RG and synthetic biology have been shown to satisfy this requirement.\nIn virology, the ultimate goal of RG is to establish antiviral methods and develop safe and effective strategies for preventing and controlling viral diseases. Vaccination is widely recognized as the most effective method for preventing infectious diseases. RG can be used to develop attenuated, chimeric, and vaccine vector vaccines. Typically, attenuated vaccines are produced by repeated passages at low temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>[132]</u>. This procedure has a number of drawbacks, including its length, uncertainty, and virulence reversion. Positively, the known genes or amino acids involved in virulence can be modified specifically using RG techniques, such as substitution and deoptimization. Due to its known role in the innate IFN-I response, the influenza virus NS1 gene is an important target for the development of an attenuated vaccine. NS1 truncation or deletion produces attenuated equine, pig, avian, feline, and human influenza viruses. These recombinant viruses induce protective responses in mice via intranasal vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>[133,134]</u>. A point mutation in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16 generates an attenuated virus capable of inducing humoral and cellular immune responses, thereby protecting against viral challenges, and is a promising vaccine strain. It is well-known that the bias of codon usage must be optimized to achieve optimal expression of the target protein. In contrast, the deoptimizing codon usage of a virulent gene will decrease the expression of the virulence gene, resulting in an attenuated virus strain for developing an attenuated vaccine. Large-scale codon deoptimization of poliovirus decreases protein synthesis efficiency and virulence 通用删除6(英):<u>[135]</u>. Deoptimization of the rotavirus M gene affects RNA transcription and viral replication 通用删除6(英):<u>[136]</u>. To study gene function and reduce virulence 通用删除6(英):<u>[137]</u>, deoptimization at the level of the bacteriophage’ s entire genome has been performed recently 通用删除6(英):<u>[138,139,140,141,142,143]</u>. Deoptimization has been used to develop attenuated vaccines against the respiratory syncytial virus, poliovirus, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>[144,145,146]</u>; this technology, synthetic attenuated virus engineering, has been dubbed SAVE. Another important application of RG in vaccine development is the construction of chimeric viruses as optimal vaccine strains. Vaccine strains are typically recombined with other important antigens to produce chimeric viruses, which can enhance safety, innate immunity, and virus-specific immunity. Adenovirus is the most commonly used vector in vaccine development 通用删除6(英):<u>[147]</u>, followed by Flavivirus YFV-17D 通用删除6(英):<u>[148]</u>. Plasmodium falciparum malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>[149]</u>, Mycobacterium tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[150]</u>, Influenza virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[151]</u>, HIV-1 通用删除6(英):<u>[152]</u>, Hepatitis C virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[153]</u>, and SARS-COV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>[154]</u>. Furthermore, Flavivirus YFV-17D is applied to develop vaccines for DENV 通用删除6(英):<u>[155]</u>, WNV 通用删除6(英):<u>[156]</u>, JEV 通用删除6(英):<u>[157]</u>, and SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>[158]</u>.\nIn conclusion, RG has made significant contributions to our advanced understanding of virology and antiviral research, including drugs and vaccines, which is advantageous to the development of strategies for preventing and controlling emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.\nAs previously described, RG has made significant contributions to virology and biomedicine. However, as an advanced technology in biology, RG may pose some biosafety and biosecurity risks if it is misapplied or used maliciously, much like nuclear fission, which was discovered to generate power for the benefit of humanity but was eventually used to create weapons such as the atomic bomb. DURC refers to the research conducted with these technologies, which includes chemical synthesis of the virus, the resurrection of the extinct pathogen, gain-of-function, and reduction of vaccine efficacy . With our extensive knowledge of the functions of viral genes, we can modify target genes or synthesize virus de novo to obtain viruses with altered characteristics, such as increased virulence, a shift in host specificity and transmission routes, and the reconstruction of the eradicated virus. Therefore, the misuse or malicious use of RG poses a significant threat to biosafety and biosecurity.\nIn 2002, Eckard Wimmer’s team successfully synthesized infectious poliovirus through the chemical synthesis of cDNA without a natural template, a feat that shocked the world like an atomic bomb. Because this work was published shortly after the 9/11 event and the 2001 anthrax mailing, it received only negative feedback from the public. This study suggests that other (existing or eradicated) deadly viruses, such as smallpox, could be chemically synthesized. Six years after the de novo artificial synthesis of poliovirus, Eckard Wimmer’s team synthesized an attenuated poliovirus that can be used for developing an attenuated vaccine through a genome-wide recoding approach 通用删除6(英):<u>[140]</u>. However, codon pairs in the viral genome can also be recoded to increase virulence or conduct gain-of-function (GOF) research. In 2018, the horsepox virus was successfully reconstructed via chemical synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u>, which is the second synthesized virus and once again sparked a major international debate due to the fact that the methods described for the horsepox virus can be used to reconstruct the eradicated smallpox virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[159]</u>. Synthetic virology is an emerging field of study that has contributed significantly to the study of viral biology, which is therefore unstoppable. Although synthetic virology may raise the issue of biosafety or biosecurity, our society’s response should not be prevention but preparation. The pandemic caused by the 1918 Spanish influenza virus resulted in 50 million deaths. However, there are still many important questions about the Spanish flu to be answered. The genomic sequences of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus were produced from lung tissue samples of victims during the 1918 pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>[160,161,162,163,164,165]</u>. To further explore the Spanish flu virus, scientists successfully reconstructed this virus in 2005 通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u>. With this resurrected virus, scientists discovered similarities between the Spanish flu virus and the H5N1 avian influenza virus, as well as its unique characteristics, which provide important guidelines for preventing emerging or re-emerging influenza viruses. Conversely, if the reconstructed virus escapes from the laboratory for unintended reasons, it will result in unexpectedly severe consequences. Additionally, since this study was published, terrorists have been able to recreate the most lethal virus for terrorist activities using publicly available protocols. Furthermore, malicious actors could create a \"supervirus\" with increased virulence, infectiousness, and pathogenicity by combining the H1N1 influenza A virus(Spanish flu virus) with other HPAVs. Before accepting this study for publication, editors consulted relevant authorities and received affirmative feedback that the study’s contributions to public health outweigh any biosecurity risks 通用删除6(英):<u>[166]</u>. Most scientists believe it is an acceptable risk for the sake of performance and responsible science, as it provides materials for scientists to investigate the origin and pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[167,168]</u>, as well as future pandemic virus preparedness 通用删除6(英):<u>[169]</u>. Therefore, professional and stringent oversight of research related to the 1918 influenza virus, as well as proper governance, are essential for the prudent application of this vital resource and technology. RG studies have uncovered the critical components involved in viral infectivity or replication, which can be used to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines against pathogens. Nonetheless, these antiviral targets could be altered maliciously to generate virus strains resistant to drugs or vaccines. Gain-of-function (GOF) studies of RG are typically used to reconstruct viruses with novel characteristics, which could result inadvertently or intentionally in a supervirus with multiple pathogenic factors, including virulent factor, transmission factor, and alternative receptor. In 2001, Australian scientists created a killer virus (ectromelia virus expressing IL-4) in the laboratory, which shocked the world because this engineered virus can kill mice by suppressing their immune systems or breaking through the vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>[85]</u>. This accidental discovery could be exploited by bioterrorists to create even more dangerous viruses, such as smallpox. Moreover, an \"optimal\" supervirus could be produced if artificial intelligence (AI) is maliciously incorporated into GOF. Recent reports indicate that the H5N1 avian influenza virus has infected humans 通用删除6(英):<u>[170]</u>, which is breaking news due to its host specificity and high pathogenicity. Global attention is focused on whether this virus will acquire the property of airborne transmission in the future. Soon after, in the laboratory, scientists demonstrated that avian H5N1 influenza viruses can acquire the capacity for airborne transmission or respiratory droplet transmission in mammals via RG or adaptation in ferrets 通用删除6(英):<u>[98,99]</u>. Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola 通用删除6(英):<u>[171]</u>, Nipah 通用删除6(英):<u>[172]</u>, chikungunya 通用删除6(英):<u>[173]</u>, West Nile 通用删除6(英):<u>[174]</u>, SARS 通用删除6(英):<u>[175]</u>, MERS 通用删除6(英):<u>[176]</u>, and COVID-19  have been frequently reported worldwide over the past three decades. RGS in these viruses has been successfully identified, contributing significantly to our understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of antiviral strategies. Emerging and re-emerging viruses with high pathogenicity nevertheless pose potential biosafety and biosecurity concerns. More reconstructed highly pathogenic viruses may increase the likelihood of virus escape. Alternatively, bioterrorists may steal or create these viruses for use in terror activities. Leakage of reconstructed viruses could lead to epidemics in nations without effective countermeasures. SARS-CoV-2 has been one of the most thoroughly studied viruses over the past two and a half years 通用删除6(英):<u>[177]</u>. Subsequently, using the well-established RG system, the functions of SARS-crucial CoV-2 genes and amino acid residues have been uncovered 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,178]</u>. Papers, protocols and tools are publicly available online and accessible by everyone 通用删除6(英):<u>[21,24,84,179,180]</u>. Therefore, studies involving genetic manipulation of SARS-CoV-2 pose a potentially high biosafety risk, which should be strictly and professionally reviewed and regulated.\nSequencing technology is rapidly evolving and generating massive amounts of genetic data. However, many of the sequence functions are unknown and require further research. As previously summarized, the establishment of RG in various fields has provided valuable platforms for examining the functions of unknown genes or nucleotide fragments and developing antiviral treatments. However, RG in virology is likely to be involved in DURC, synthetic biology, and pathogens, which is associated with the potential for biosafety and biosecurity during RG-related research. Moreover, we aim to provide a summary of the pertinent laws and regulations for these three points of RG that have been formulated and issued by some countries around the world, which is intended to serve as a reference for countries that do not have similar laws and regulations. The ultimate objective of governance is to aid scientists in the safe and effective application of RG to molecular virology, infectious disease prevention, and control.\nAs advanced biotechnology involves gene manipulation, RG’s DUR or DURC should be carefully considered in advance. The biosafety and biosecurity risks posed by DURC must be mitigated by means of comprehensive oversight of RG’s dual use. DURC. However, it is challenging to determine the risks of DURC. In 2002, US Federal Experts Security Advisory Panel tasked the CDC and USDA with updating the Select Agents and Toxin List every 2 years. Research involving agents on this list must adhere to the Federal Select Agent Program’s biosafety, biosecurity, and policy guidelines. In 2004, Biotechnology research in an Age of Terrorism (the Fink Report) defined the term DURC with reference to a series of international agreements, including the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in 1972, the Asilomar Conference in 1975, the Australia Group in 1984, and the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997. This report lists 11 biological DURCs and is a very useful resource for regulators to identify and categorize biomedical DURCs. In addition, Canada, German, Danish, and the Netherlands have issued some guidelines and evaluation tools for DURC. Recently, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in Netherland has developed an online evaluation tool for DURC 通用删除1(英):<u>(Dual-Use Quickscan, https://www.dualusequickscan.com)</u> based on the published data about DURC from around the world 通用删除6(英):<u>[181]</u>. In this system, scientists can assess the risk of DURC by responding to 15 yes/no questions, which are then sent automatically to the Biorisk Management Advisor for review. If this tool indicates a high risk of DURC, the advisor may discuss it with other scientists and devise a plan to reduce the risk. In China, the Biosafety Law of the People’s Republic of China enacted in 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>[182]</u> contains articles regarding the prevention of biotechnology DURC. These articles emphasize the prohibition of biotechnology-related activities (research, development, or application) that endanger public health, biological resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity, as well as other activities that endanger biosafety and biosecurity. Moreover, strict legal provisions are proposed for the supervision of research on human genetic resources (Chapter IV), biological materials and research with potential bioterrorism applications (Chapter VII), and research on pathogens not yet identified or eradicated in China (Chapter V). In addition, the Ministry of Science and Technology in China issued the biotechnology-related regulation entitled Measures for the Safety Management of Biotechnology Research and Development in 2017. Other legislation about dual-use is summarized in the reviews 通用删除6(英):<u>[183,184]</u>. In addition to the mentioned laws, governance, and regulations, it is necessary to consider public participation and stakeholder education as additional methods for reducing DURC risk. The public should be made aware of the potential risks associated with DURC, as the research not only uses public funds but also exposes the public to potential risks. Risk-benefit justification requires that the public be aware of how scientists propose to avoid these risks and the anticipated benefits of these studies to society. In terms of public awareness, the media are crucial and required to accurately report the research content and DURC risk based on scientific evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>[185]</u> and to correctly direct the public to conduct risk-benefit analysis for DURC 通用删除6(英):<u>[186]</u>. In fact, stakeholders play a crucial role in reducing the risk of DURC due to their awareness of risks and the self-regulation methods they have proposed. Therefore, education and awareness training are required to reduce biosafety and biosecurity risks. Since international regulations may vary, and DURC may pose global risks, it is necessary to employ uniform standards (Global non-discriminatory standards), particularly for agents that can cause global diseases, such as SARS-CoV-2.\nSecondly, after synthetic biology came out, it was immediately applied to and revolutionized RG. In this instance, RG should adhere to synthetic biology regulations. Although synthetic biology possesses the characteristic of DURC and must adhere to the regulations mentioned above of DURC, it possesses unique characteristics. There have been extensive analyses of synthetic biology and its potential risks 通用删除6(英):<u>[187]</u>. Here, we briefly introduce some regulations and laws pertaining to synthetic biology and risk-reduction measures. NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines) provide detailed safety practices and containment procedures for research involving synthetic nucleic acid molecules and has been widely referred to as a synthetic biology guideline . The Statement of Ethics and its six guiding principles were recently presented by the Engineering Biology Research Consortium in the United States to guide researchers 通用删除6(英):<u>[188]</u>. In China, as advanced biotechnology, synthetic biology should first comply with the Biosafety Law of the People’s Republic of China 通用删除6(英):<u>[182]</u>, followed by the Measures for the Safety Management of Biotechnology Research and Development. There are three regulations for synthetic biology in China ’s agriculture 通用删除6(英):<u>[182]</u>. In terms of biosafety, biosecurity, and bioethics, the regulations of synthetic biology can be summarized as 7P in terms of biosafety, biosecurity, and bioethics, namely Principal Investigator, Project, Premises, Provider, Purchaser, Public, and Publisher 通用删除6(英):<u>[189]</u>. Principal Investigator, Project, Public, and Publisher are mentioned in the DURC regulations. Provider and purchaser are also crucial aspects of synthetic biology regulation. The government should oversee Providers and require them to screen the sequences that have been requested. The suspect sequences must be marked and reported to the appropriate government and officials. Screening Framework Guidance for Providers of Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA 通用删除7(英):<u>(2010)</u> and Harmonized Screening Protocol has been developed by the US Department of Health and Human Services, businesses, and relevant organizations for screening the ordered sequences. In accordance with this guide, synthesis companies in the United States typically screen-submitted orders by consulting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) databases. In addition to synthetic DNA, the government should oversee and manage instruments, equipment, software, and reagents ordered by the purchaser. Furthermore, laboratory precautions are crucial to reducing the risk associated with synthetic biology 通用删除6(英):<u>[187]</u>. Some gene elements, such as microbial suicide genes 通用删除6(英):<u>[190]</u>, can be consciously introduced as controllers during design and synthesis. The method of xenobiology establishes a genetic firewall by introducing unnatural base pairs or noncanonical amino acids during synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[191]</u>. Therefore, even if the synthesized organizations are leaked or misused, they cannot survive and integrate into the natural environment outside of the experimental conditions. To facilitate the tracing of synthetic DNA or organizations, DNA watermarks or barcodes, which can also be used to protect intellectual property, can be employed 通用删除6(英):<u>[192]</u>.\nLastly, if RG was used to genetically modify viruses, it should adhere to the relevant regulations on pathogens. Laboratory Biosafety Manual (4th edition) by WHO and Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (6th edition) by US NIH and CDC describe the classification of pathogens and the level of biosafety protection corresponding to each classification. Most countries also have their own regulations, governances, and laws regarding pathogen operations, such as the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act (HPTA) and Human Pathogens and Toxins Regulations in Canada, the Security Sensitive Biological Agents Regulatory Scheme in Australia. The Approved List of biological agents 通用删除7(英):<u>(2021)</u> in the UK and Reference lists for risk classification of microorganisms in Belgium. Chapter V of the Biosafety Law of the People’s Republic of China addresses the biosafety of laboratories containing pathogenic microorganisms, including pathogens 通用删除6(英):<u>[182]</u>. Additionally, China has issued a series of laws and regulations on pathogenic microorganisms, which cover the reservation, laboratory activity, and transportation of pathogenic microorganisms 通用删除6(英):<u>[182]</u>.\nIn conclusion, after the integration of synthetic biology and AI optimization, RG, advanced biotechnology, has become an indispensable tool for molecular virology and the development of antiviral strategies. In order for RG to contribute to human public health, global governance is required due to its DURC property and global effects. Nonetheless, RG should not be viewed as Pandora’s box because the potential biosafety and biosecurity risks of studies involving RG can be anticipated and further minimized through education and training of relevant personnel, media publicity, oversight of laws and regulations, and other measures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The estimated disease incidence of Pompe disease at birth is 1 in 40,000,通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> but other studies showed that the incidence might be underestimated with 1: 8684 in Austria通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> and 1: 11,987 in Taiwan, China.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\nAccording to symptom onset age and disease severity, Pompe disease is classified into two forms: the infantile-onset form and the late-onset form (childhood-, juvenile-, and adult-onset forms). Patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease have severe hypotonia and muscle weakness with cardiac involvement in the first few months of life that induce cardiorespiratory failure and death before 1 year of age. In contrast, the phenotype of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is less severe and characterized by slowly progressive myopathy with or without respiratory impairment.\nThe GAA gene is mapped to the human chromosome 17q25.2–q25.3. It contains 20 exons with the first amino acid encoded in exon 2 and the last in exon 20. Pathogenic sequence variations are distributed across all 19 coding genes, but the catalytic barrel gene (c.1039-c.2454) contains the highest percentage of pathologically severe mutations.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> To date, over 550 different mutations have been described worldwide . There is a marked genotype heterogeneity among LOPD patients from different ethnics and areas, but to the best of our knowledge, only 18 articles about GAA gene mutations in Chinese LOPD patients have been published with 32 novel mutations in total.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]</u> To further expand the genetic spectrum and understand the genotype-phenotype correlations, herein we report five Chinese LOPD patients with seven novel GAA gene mutations.\nAs a retrospective study for the clinicopathological features of LOPD patients, muscle specimens used for genetic analysis were obtained from previous clinical work and data analysis was performed anonymously. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Hospital. Patient consent was exempt by the Ethics Committee due to the retrospective nature of this study.\nFive patients diagnosed with LOPD at our institution from April 1986 to August 2017 were included in this study. They were from unrelated families, and none had consanguineous parents. The confirmatory diagnosis was based on clinical characteristics, muscle pathology, and genetic tests. Detailed general history, clinical features, and laboratory data were collected.\nAll five patients had open muscle biopsies, three in musculus biceps brachii and two in quadriceps femoris. After removal, muscle samples were fixed in glutaraldehyde, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then, stored in −80°C. Serial muscle sections (5 μm thick) were stained for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), oil red O (ORO), modified Gomori trichrome (MGT), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH), nonspecific esterase (NSE), acid phosphatase (ACP), and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) after preincubation in pH 4.3, 4.5, and 10.6. Morphometric evaluations of stained muscle sections were performed with light microscopy (Olympus Corporation, Japan).\nAgene panel that contains 142 neuromuscular disorder-related genes, including 15 genes responsible for glycogen storage disease, was used for next-generation sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen muscle specimens using QIAmp DNA Blood Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA probes were designed to bind exons and 50 bp flanking intronic sequences. The final enriched DNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, the United States of America) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Variants were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\nThe novel mutations were searched in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database 通用删除1(英):<u>(dbSNP, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/projects/SNP/, National Institutes of Health, USA)</u>, the 1000 Genomes database , Exome Sequencing Project 删除2：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(ESP6500, http://evs. gs.washington.edu/EVS/, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, USA)</u></u>, Exome Aggregation Consortium 通用删除1(英):<u>(ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org/, Broad Institute, USA)</u>, the Genome Aggregation Database 通用删除1(英):<u>(gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/, international coalition of investigators)</u>, and the clinVar database  and the in-house database for normal healthy controls. Pathogenicity of novel missense mutations was predicted using bioinformatics software programs such as SIFT , Mutation Taster ,通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> and PolyPhen2 .通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>\nDescriptive statistics were used to analyze the clinical and laboratory data. Proportions were calculated for categorical variables (i.e. gender). Summary statistics (median, range) were calculated for continuous measures (i.e. age and disease course). The median was chosen as the descriptive measure for the disease onset age, diagnostic delay, and the age at diagnosis. SPSS 17.0 software (the International Business Machines Corporation, USA) was used for statistical analysis.\nThe study involved five patients, three were males and two were females. The disease onset age ranged from 1 to 19 years with a median of 13 years. The median age at diagnosis was 22 years (range16–42 years) with a median disease course of 5 years (range 3–41 years). None of the patients had a positive family history. Progressive skeletal muscle weakness was the initial and cardinal symptom, which mainly affected the proximal (100%) and axial (80%) muscles with predominant involvement of the lower limbs. One patient suffered from progressive respiratory insufficiency within a month and required artificial ventilation. Two patients had scoliosis, and one patient had both lordosis and kyphosis. Three patients had weakness in the anterior cervical muscles. The disease onset age for the four patients who had axial muscle weakness ranged from 1 to 13 years while the patient without axial muscle involvement had a later onset of initial symptoms at 19 years. Detailed clinical features were summarized in Table 1.\nClinical and pathological features of five LOPD patients\n删除重复语句：<u>Clinical and pathological features of five LOPD patients</u>\nLOPD: Late-onset Pompe disease; CK: Creatine kinase; EMG: Electromyography.\nCreatine kinase (CK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were tested in all patients at the time of diagnosis. Four patients (80%) had mild-to-moderate elevations in CK levels, while three patients (60%) had mild elevated LDH levels. The median levels for CK and LDH were 1168.3 U/L (range 73.5–1652.0 U/L; normal <200.0 U/L) and 331.8 U/L (range 151.0–610.0 U/L; normal 40.0–250.0 U/L), respectively. All patients had myogenic damage in electromyography examinations.\nMuscle biopsies were performed in all five patients. H and E staining showed vacuoles with variable sizes and shapes inside muscle fibers which stained positive in PAS and exhibited strong reactions for lysosomal ACP staining. Blue basophilic particles were found inside the vacuoles in all five cases (100%). Internal nuclei and endomysial fibrosis were observed in three patients (60%), while fiber hypertrophy and split appeared in two patients (40%). No RRF (ragged red fiber) was found in GMT staining. ORO staining showed no lipid storage for all five patients. Hyperchromatic necrotic fibers could be seen in NADH and NSE staining. In ATPase staining, two patients (40%) had an even distribution of Type I and Type II fibers, while Type II fibers were dominant in two patients (40%) and Type I fibers were dominant in one patient (20%). Vacuolization solely affected Type II fibers in two patients (40%), and affected both fiber types in the other three patients (60%).\nAll five patients underwent genetic tests and were found to have compound heterozygous mutations in GAA gene. Ten GAA gene sequence variants were detected, including three reported mutations (c.1309C>T, c.2237G>A, and c.2238G>C) and seven novel mutations. Nine of the ten mutations (90%) were found in the catalytic barrel (c.1039-c.2454) except mutation c.796C>A. Each mutation was detected in only one patient with an allele frequency of 10% (1/10). The seven novel mutations were composed of one nonsense mutation (c.1057C>T), one frameshift mutation (c.2235dupG), and five missense mutations (c.796C>A, c.1201C>A, c.1780C>T, c.1799G>C, and c.2051C>A). Detailed molecular information was summarized in Table 2.\nThe GAA gene mutations of five LOPD patients\n删除重复语句：<u>The GAA gene mutations of five LOPD patients</u>\nGAA: Acid alpha-glucosidase; LOPD: Late-onset Pompe disease.\nNone of the seven novel mutations were found in the SNP138, 1000 Genomes, ESP6500, ExAC, gnomAD, ClinVar databases or the in-house database for normal healthy controls. By conservation analysis, the mutation p.P266T (c.796C>A) was proved to be less conserved among different species, while the other four novel missense mutations were highly conserved 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. In silico analysis, the c.796C>A mutation was predicted to be benign, and the other four missense mutations were predicted to be deleterious. The nonsense mutation c.1057C>T  was presumed to be deleterious because it caused a premature termination codon upstream of the catalytic site and could lead to the formation of a truncated protein and loss of GAA enzyme function. The frameshift mutation c.2235dupG  could also introduce a premature stop codon and was thus predicted to be deleterious.\nHere, we provide clinicopathological and genetic analysis in a cohort of five LOPD patients with novel GAA gene mutations diagnosed at our institution over the past 30 years. The dominant clinical manifestation for the five patients was muscle weakness in the proximal extremities (100%) and axial muscles (80%), which is consistent with some previous reports.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u> However, in 2012, a study of 94 patients with Pompe disease represented a different pattern of muscle involvement. In that study, the strength of the quadriceps muscle was reduced in only 55% of patients, but the shoulder abductors, abdominal muscles, paraspinal muscles, and gluteus muscles were affected in more than 80% of all patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> The differences could come from the different methods to measure muscle strength: our study used the manual muscle test with the Medical Research Council grading scale, while the aforementioned article used the manual muscle test, hand-held dynamometry (HHD), and the quick motor function test (QMFT), collectively. It reminds us that although the manual muscle test is convenient and simple, clinicians should also use more precise methods to fully assess the distribution of muscle weakness, such as the QMFT, HHD, and the computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging muscle scans, especially for asymptomatic patients and those with minor muscle strength loss. Another hypothesis is that the distribution of muscle involvement differs among patients from distinct ethnic groups, but it requires further investigations.\nWe found out that patients who exhibited axial muscle weakness had earlier disease onset ages than those who did not, and a study about LOPD in 54 Dutch patients通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> also revealed that the patients with scoliosis experienced their first complaints before 21 years of age, while the mean age for all 54 patients was 28.1 ± 14.3 years. The mechanism is not clear yet, but this discovery reminds us to pay more attention to the axial muscle strength for LOPD patients with early disease onset age.\nThroughout our study, we tried to identify a genotype-phenotype correlation and found some supporting evidences. Patient one 通用删除11(英):<u>(P1)</u> had a nonsense mutation and a missense mutation c.1201C>A which was predicted to be deleterious in two GAA alleles, while patient four 通用删除11(英):<u>(P4)</u> had a nonsense mutation and a missense mutation c.796C>A predicted to be benign. The two compound heterozygous mutations of P1 were more deleterious than those of P4, which led to severer clinical symptoms. Compared to P4, P1 had earlier symptoms onset age (1 vs. 13 years), longer disease duration (41 vs. 3 years), and severer muscle weakness in lower extremities (III/V vs. IV/V).\nUnfortunately, we did not find the same correlation between the effects of GAA gene mutations and the severity of clinical presentations in other patients. There are several possible explanations. First, it is difficult to predict the combined effects of compound heterozygous mutations, since they can disturb GAA enzyme activity at various points of the protein synthesis processing and subsequently result in heterogeneous phenotypes.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Second, certain modifying factors can affect the actions of GAA sequence variations. De Filippi et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> reported that polymorphisms of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and alpha-actinin 3 (ACTN3) could modulate the clinical symptoms of Pompe patients. The DD genotype in ACE gene (absence or deletion of D in a 287-base-pair alu repeat within intron 16) and the XX genotype in ACTN3 gene 通用删除1(英):<u>(R577X polymorphism with a C to T conversion at position 1747 in exon 16)</u> were significantly associated with an earlier age of disease onset. Other genetic and nongenetic factors can also impact the clinical manifestations of LOPD patients. Third, the functions of prediction software programs are limited. They cannot predict the precise severity of the novel mutations. Fourth, the five cases in our study did not provide enough evidences to get exact conclusions. Thus, the correlations between genotype and phenotype of LOPD patients should be further investigated.\nThe three known mutations detected in our study are relatively common in Chinese LOPD patients. To the best of our knowledge, 18 articles about GAA gene mutations in Chinese LOPD patients have been published so far, nine in English and nine in Chinese.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]</u> In these articles, a total of 107 patients from 98 families with 66 different mutations were reported, and 32 mutations were novel at the time of publication. The mutations are spread throughout the 19 coding genes except for exons 3, 10, and 18. Exon 2, which contains a start codon, and exon 9 and 15, which are in the enzyme catalytic barrel, have the greatest number of mutations, in line with previous reports.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,29]</u> Among the 66 mutations, 37 (56%) were reported only once, 22 (33%) were reported from two to five times, and seven (11%) were reported six or more times, correlating with previous reports.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> The most common mutations were pseudo-deficiency mutations c.1726G>A and mutation c.2238G>C, which accounted for 33 (16.8%) and 32 alleles (16.3%), respectively. Mutation c.2238G>C was prevalent in LOPD patients from the mainland of China, Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong, China, while mutation c.1726G>A was rarely detected in patients from the mainland of China. The Chinese founder mutation c.1935C>A and the combined mutation c.(752C>T; 761C>T) accounted for 25 (12.8%) and 16 alleles (8.2%), respectively, but these mutations were more prevalent among patients from Taiwan, China. As for the other two known mutations in our study, except for c.2238G>C (16.3%), c.1309C>T was detected in six alleles (3.1%), and c.2237G>A was detected in four alleles (2.0%).\nTo date, a few prevalent mutations in LOPD patients from other ethnic populations have been reported, but they are rarely detected in Chinese patients. Likewise, common mutations found in Chinese patients mentioned above are infrequent in other populations. For example, mutation c.-32-13T>G is the most frequent pathogenic mutation found in Caucasian individuals with an allele frequency of 42.3–47.4%,通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31,32,33]</u> but it has been identified just two times in Chinese LOPD patients. Other common mutations, such as c.596G>A and c.668A>G (frequency per family 35.9%) in the Brazilian population,通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> and c.2560C>T in the African-American population,通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> have not been previously reported in Chinese LOPD patients. The above common mutations were not detected in our cohort of patients either. Combining with the fact that detection rate of novel mutations in Chinese patients is as high as 16.3% (32/196) and considering the findings described above, we believe that considerable genetic heterogeneity exists in LOPD patients from China.\nThe seven novel mutations found in our study expand the genetic spectrum of LOPD patients, and six of them were predicted to be deleterious. However, the pathogenicity of the seven mutations has not been verified by in vivo or in vitro experiments. Our future research will focus on the pathogenicity and severity rating of the novel mutations.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by grants of National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81501083 and 81671236)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

With the use of potent immunosuppressants, acute rejection does not always present typical manifestations. Moreover, other complications often occur concomitantly after liver transplantation, which makes early diagnosis of acute rejection more difficult. Acute rejection is best diagnosed by liver biopsy. Differentiation of clinical manifestations and pathological features plays an important role in achieving individualized immunosuppressive treatment and prolonging long term survival of patients given orthotopic liver transplants.Methods From January 2004 to December 2006, 516 orthotopic liver transplantations were performed at the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University. For patients who suffered acute rejection, clinical manifestations, histopathological features, diagnosis and anti-rejection treatment were summarized and analyzed. Results In 86 cases (16.7%), of the 516 recipients, 106 episodes of acute rejection occurred, which included 9 with histopathological borderline changes, 36 Banff Ⅰ rejections, 48 Banff Ⅱ and 13 Banff Ⅲ. Among these, 36 were cured by adjusting the dose of immunosuppressant and 65 were reversed by methylprednisolone pulse treatment. Five were methylprednisolone resistant, 3 of whom were given OKT3 treatment and 2 underwent liver retransplantation. Conclusions Due to potent immunosuppressive agents, acute rejection following an orthotopic liver transplantation lacks typical clinical manifestations and pathological features. Acute rejection is best diagnosed by liver biopsy. Designing rational individualized immunosuppressive regimen based on clinical and pathological features of acute rejection plays an important role in prolonging long term survival of patients。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Conversely, overuse of cesarean section has not shown benefits and can create harm.3 In rural area of sub-Saharan Africa, cesarean rates are 1%–2%, but in Egypt and Greece, the frequency is more than 50%. High cesarean section use is observed among low-risk births, especially among more educated women in, for example, Brazil and China.2 Maternal request is one cause of high cesarean rates, but also intrapartum cesarean section rates are much higher than medically indicated. In China the cesarean section rate is 45%4; close to 2/3 of urban women give birth by cesarean section and 25% in rural areas. A marked reduction in cesarean section rates was observed in an urban tertiary care center in Shanghai as a result of efforts to reduce the high rate of caesarean delivery. No notable differences in neonatal outcomes were observed.5 Cesarean section rates higher than 10% are not associated with reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates.6 Cesarean section is associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture, abnormal placentation, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, and preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies.7 Avoiding the first cesarean influences delivery mode in subsequent deliveries. WHO recommends that every effort should be made to provide cesarean sections to women in need, rather than striving to achieve a specific rate.8 Efforts to lower cesarean section rates are multiple, including policy change, patient education, and physician training.\nCaesarean section in the second stage of labor has highest risk for complications and at low stations operative vaginal delivery is a safe alternative. Precise diagnosis of labor progress is essential for optimizing appropriate interventions at the right time. There is an underuse of assisted vaginal deliveries in many countries,9 and more operative vaginal deliveries will reduce the rate of cesarean deliveries and will have pediatric and maternal benefits. Indications for an operative vaginal delivery are prolonged second stage of labor, suspicion of immediate or potential fetal compromise and shortening the second stage for maternal benefit. The risks and benefits of operative vaginal delivery need to be balanced against those for cesarean delivery. It is crucial to know fetal position before the use of forceps, and also before performing manual rotations of the fetal head. In vacuum extractions, the cup should be placed as close to the flexion point as possible; thus, the position of the fetal head should be assured. The risk of vacuum failure is only 2% in a fetus in occiput anterior position at a low station.删除4：<u>10</u>\nThe most common indications for cesarean section during labor are labor dystocia and fetal distress. Labor dystocia is often diagnosed on a subjective impression of the responsible birth attendant. Clinicians should pay attention to the cause of slow progress, which can be due to insufficient contractions, fetal maternal disproportions, or malpositions. Occiput posterior position occurs in around 30% of cases in early labor; however, most fetuses will rotate spontaneously.11,12 Only 7% will be in occiput posterior position at delivery. However, persistent occiput posterior position is associated with complicated deliveries. Little attention is paid to labor mechanisms in contemporary obstetrics. The human fetal head is large related to the maternal pelvis. The cardinal movements are essential for the fetus to pass through the birth canal. The first cardinal movement is flexion, followed by rotation, deflexion, and at last rotation for the shoulders to pass. These processes are complicated and impossible to reliably examine with our hands. Therefore, ultrasound can help clinicians understanding labor mechanisms and labor progression.\nFew centers use ultrasound routinely during active labor. Fetal position and station can be examined with ultrasound. It has been shown in many studies that ultrasound is more accurate than clinical examinations13,14,15,16; however, the use of intrapartum ultrasound has not shown to reduce cesarean section rates yet. Ultrasound may assist the clinicians to make more precise diagnosis and to objectively confirm the diagnosis of labor dystocia. New studies are needed at large hospitals. The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) published practice guidelines for intrapartum ultrasound in 2018.17 The recommended indications are as follows:\nSlow progress or arrest of labor in the first stageSlow progress or arrest of labor in the second stageAscertainment of fetal head position and station before considering or performing instrumental vaginal deliveryObjective assessment of fetal head malpresentation\nSlow progress or arrest of labor in the first stage\nSlow progress or arrest of labor in the second stage\nAscertainment of fetal head position and station before considering or performing instrumental vaginal delivery\nObjective assessment of fetal head malpresentation\nUltrasound is easy to learn, especially transabdominal scanning showing position will be easy to learn by inexperienced ultrasound examiners. A study from France showed that the learning and accuracy of the determination of fetal head position in labor were easier and higher with transabdominal sonography than with digital examination.18 The probe should first be placed transversely; thereafter longitudinally. The most important landmarks are the fetal face and eyes in occiput posterior position and the cervical spine in occiput anterior position . Other landmarks are the midline cerebral echo for occiput transverse and the choroid plexuses that are diverging toward posterior and are useful landmarks at low stations.\nFetal station can be examined using transperineal scanning. The two most used methods are angle of progression and head–perineum distance. The techniques are described in detail in the ISUOG guidelines.17 Correct determination of head position and station is crucial before an instrumental delivery. Ultrasound images should be stored in the medical records. It is important to have objectively documented results in case of litigation.\nIntrapartum ultrasound should not replace clinical examinations, but can be used as a complementary tool. It should not undermine the skills of birth attendants. Ultrasound can supplement clinician’s skills and help them to improve their clinical practice.\nIn conclusion, ultrasound should be implemented as a diagnostic tool in labor and used in women with slow labor progress. The ultrasound techniques are easy to learn and understand, and can also be used by nonexperts. Ultrasound will improve clinicians’ understanding of the labor progression. The use of ultrasound in active labor has the potential to diagnose the cause of slow labor progress and to reassure clinicians when it is safe to perform an operative vaginal delivery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

They are often caused by high-energy trauma and are associated with a high mortality rate.1 However, such severe injuries with complex patterns are seen more commonly nowadays due to high-speed trauma caused in road traffic accidents (RTA) on motorways. High mortality rates (50%-77%) have been reported for femoral shaft fractures associated with pelvic fractures and injuries to other systems.2 These injuries have a great impact not only on the social and economic life of individual, but also on the society.3 We present a rare case of bilateral unstable pelvic fractures (acetabular and sacral fractures), bilateral segmental femoral shaft fracture with multiple right rib fractures and associated haemothorax.

She was travelling with family and friends in a four wheeler jeep when the driver of her vehicle tried to overtake a truck in high speed and had a head-on collision with the truck coming from opposite side. Five out of seven co-passengers died in this accident on the spot. Only 2 young ladies, sitting in the rear seat of the jeep, survived this fatal accident . They were admitted in a nearby hospital where they had primary resuscitative treatment and were then referred to our tertiary care center 5 days after the accident.\nOn admission, this patient was in a state of hemorrhagic shock and was found to have multiple injuries, including multiple right rib fractures with haemothorax, bilateral segmental femur fractures , bilateral acetabular and sacral fractures , with involvement of lumbosacral plexus causing foot drop on both sides.\nHer medical condition was stabilized by multiple blood transfusions, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, splinting of fractures by skeletal traction, right chest tube drainage and other supportive measures. She was then operated on in 2 sittings at the gap of 2 days to fix all the major fractures. Firstly, the segmental fractures of both femora were fixed under general anaesthesia using intramedullary interlocking nails, taking the adequate precaution of padding the perineal and sacral areas. Right side segmental femur fracture was fixed with an antegrade femoral nail; whereas left comminuted segmental fracture was more proximal (subtrochanteric) therefore was fixed with Synthes' shaft fracture nailing system. Postoperatively, she was kept in intensive care for close monitoring. She responded very well to the first surgery and hence after two days the sacral fractures were fixed using a sacral bar in a prone position. And then the patient was turned supine and anterior column fractures of both the acetabulum were fixed with pre-contoured reconstruction plates through the bilateral ilioinguinal approach.\nThe postoperative courses after both surgeries were uneventful. She was allowed sitting in bed from the 2nd postoperative day and active and passive exercises were started. After 10 days, she was discharged after stitches removal. Physiotherapy and wheelchair mobilization were advised for 6 weeks. At a follow-up of 3 months, she had shown neurological recovery and the ankle dorsiflexors were improved from the Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 0 to grade 3 and at 6 months to grade 4+. Follow-up radiographs showed satisfactory healing of all the fractures in good alignment at 12 months . She was allowed partial weight bearing mobilization with crutches after 2 months of the surgery. She not only survived this major accident but escaped from any major complication related to her fracture and treatment.\nThere is paucity in the literature about the mechanism, priority and optimal treatment of the concomitant unstable pelvic and segmental femoral shaft fractures.4 Due to non-availability of suitable guidelines to treat such complex injuries, the optimal treatment of these fractures remains controversial. We consider that combined femoral shaft and unstable pelvic fractures are severe injuries and necessitate timely and aggressive management. The femoral fractures need precedence over pelvic fracture fixation.\nUnderstanding the mechanism of such fracture pattern remains a challenge. Malgaigne's fracture is an unstable pelvic fracture through both pubic rami and the ilium or sacroiliac joint with vertical displacement. These fractures result from application of axial force through the femur, through extended knees when a motor vehicle occupant is bracing during frontal collision, or from dashboard injury to the knee, vertical shear forces are involved. A bucket handle fracture refers to an ipsilateral fracture of the pelvis and femur. It is an uncommon injury occurring from the axial force through the femur resulting in a posterior acetabular fracture and femoral shaft fracture. The mechanism of injury, in this case, could have been due to an axial force through the extended knee resulting in vertical shear force in the pelvis leading to bilateral acetabulum fracture and bilateral sacral fracture. The segmental comminuted fracture of bilateral shaft femur might have been due to crushing of both the bones between some heavy objects of the jeep body parts. It is, however, difficult to conceive and explain these injuries with any single mode of injury; as the 4 wheeler had tumbled many times after the initial strike and, therefore, a multi-hit theory only can explain such an injury pattern.\nBilateral femoral fractures associated with unstable pelvic fractures and visceral damage have been reported with a very high mortality and morbidity rate. These patients should be initially managed with the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol5,6 and once stable, surgical intervention should be considered. If the patient remains unstable the principles of damage control orthopaedics (DCO) should be followed.6 This patient presented to us in a state of shock, thus priority for us was to stabilize the patient hemodynamically and once the patient was stabilized we proceeded for the definitive fixation of the fractures in staged manner, giving priority to femoral shaft fractures.\nIn this case, we fixed both the femora in the first sitting with an interlocking nail, with minimal reaming. All care was taken to avoid the displacement of the pelvic fracture. The patient was moved gently to the fracture table for the fixation of the femur and gentle traction was applied intraoperatively to prevent secondary injury to the pelvic fractures or to prevent re-bleeding from the pelvic cavity.2 Subsequently, in the second sitting an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of bilateral acetabulum fracture and bilateral sacral fractures was done. Tscherne et al7 suggested that in patients with multiple closed fractures, femur fractures must be given priority over pelvis.\nAn early and timely surgical intervention to fix all the major fractures helps the patient to overcome the medical complications and provide better rehabilitation. The data suggest that aggressive resuscitation for multiply-injured patients and early or delayed ORIF without application of external fixation will lead to overall low mortality rate.删除4：<u>8</u>\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2016.01.017</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

It is often used as a metaphor for complex, mysterious, and incomprehensible problems. With the deterioration of modern living environment and the aggravation of stress, the incidence of the tumor is on the rise. Excessive or prolonged stress can lead to acute or chronic organ dysfunction and metabolic disorders. Studies have shown that tumor patients are often under long-term adverse stress states. Chronic mental stress alters tumor cell survival, proliferation and metastasis by activating stress-related transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways in the body. With the demonstration of their important role in tumor development under stress, related pathways or cytokines could be antagonized or inhibited to change the trajectory of the tumor development. This article explores how chronic mental stress affects the presence of tumor cells by influencing the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor 2/insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF2/IGF1R), C-reactive protein (CRP) and other possible pathways in cancer patients.\nBDNF is a secretory protein in the neurotrophic protein family, which plays an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors under chronic mental stress state. Long-term stress can reduce the volume of gray matter in the hippocampus and other marginal brain regions and downregulate the expression of BDNF in different regions of the central nervous system, thereby reducing the expression level of BDNF and its receptor tyrosine kinase receptor 2.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The BDNF gene has nine selective promoters, of which promoter I (pI) and promoter IV (pIV) are highly sensitive to neuronal activity. The transcription factor binding sites in pI and pIV of the BDNF gene have a variety of calcium response elements, which are necessary for membrane depolarization-driven L voltage-gated calcium channel (L-VGCC)-dependent induction of BDNF expression. Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) protein is a family of transcription factors that regulate transcriptional programs associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis. The different outcomes of BDNF expression depend on the MEF2 subtypes involved, for example, MEF2C promotes BDNF-related synaptic enhancement and upregulates BDNF expression. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette (ABC) efflux transport proteins belong to the largest transporter superfamily. ATP-binding cassette efflux transporter G2 (ABCG2) is one of the most important ABC efflux transport proteins and functions by actively expelling substances from cells to protect normal tissues from the intrusion of heterogeneous substances. ABCG2 is widely expressed in various tissues and participates in the distribution of multiple endogenous substances and drugs. This protein is also widely considered a transporter involved in multidrug resistance. The decrease in BDNF levels under stress state leads to the upregulation of ABCG2 expression and enhanced drug resistance, which cause accelerated growth and metastasis of tumor cells. ABCG2 upregulation may be one of the mechanisms by which BDNF induces tumor resistance. Therefore, the decrease of BDNF level under chronic mental stress will promote the disease progression and the formation of drug resistance in tumor patients. However, the level of the BDNF in the body is dynamic, and all substances in the body have a range or critical value, so the effect of the BDNF on patients with different tumors may vary and need to be further studied.\nThe insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system consists of the peptide ligands IGF1, IGF2 and insulin and the receptors IGF1R, IGF2R, insulin receptor and IGF-binding proteins and plays a key role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and so on. Among them, overexpression of IGF2 in tumor cells usually leads to excessive proliferation of cells, which is significantly related to clinical indicators of disease progression, drug resistance and survival time. Stress is usually caused by social, physical and mental stressors that induce the release of stress-related neurotransmitters and hormones by activating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, such as norepinephrine (NE). NE induces L-VGCC phosphorylation via the β-adrenergic receptor-protein kinase A pathway, which triggers calcium mobilization and promotes IGF2 secretion. The biological function of IGF2 is mainly realized by combining with IGF1R. IGF1R regulates cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and promotes invasion by activating downstream phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and RAS/extracellular regulated protein kinases pathways.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> AKT downstream effectors modulate cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis and also play a key role in apoptosis, in which mTOR complex 1 is a major effector at the downstream of AKT. The role of AKT in invasion and metastasis further demonstrates the importance of IGF2 in the cancer-related IGF signaling pathways. Stress-activated IGF2/IGF1R axis can promote the proliferation and migration of tumor cells, and improve tumor invasiveness and chemoresistance, thus shortening the survival time of tumor patients and reducing their quality of life. Due to the upregulation of IGF2 expression in tumor cells, IGF2/IGF1R has become an interesting target in cancer therapy. Blocking the IGF2/IGF1R pathway by blocking receptor-ligand interactions or limiting kinase activation can inhibit the proliferation and growth of tumor cells and make them sensitive to programmed cell death, so as to inhibit tumor occurrence and development, restore drug sensitivity and improve the prognosis of patients. Therefore, how to block the IGF2/IGF1R axis will become the important concerns to inhibit tumor cell growth and migration and restore drug sensitivity. The IGF2/IGF1R signaling pathway will be an important target to prevent tumorigenesis and metastasis.\nCRP is an acute phase reactant and biomarker produced by the liver in response to a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-6 and is a common marker of inflammatory diseases. Tumors are mostly caused by inflammatory stimulation, and the tumor microenvironment is also composed of inflammatory cells, so inflammation is an important player in cancer occurrence and progression and promotes tumor cell formation, proliferation and metastasis. Stress activates the HPA axis and the SNS, resulting in increased stress hormone (mainly catecholamines and cortisol) release. Stress hormones directly or indirectly activate the immune system, thus increasing the expression of IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α and other proinflammatory cytokines. Elevation of the expression levels of stress-related proinflammatory cytokines stimulates increased production and release of CRP in the liver. Proinflammatory cytokines can also induce the production of more proinflammatory cytokines by activating the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Extensive evidence indicates that elevated CRP levels are related to increased tumor incidence, tumor metastasis and shortened total survival time and can thus serve as a prognostic marker in tumor patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Chronic mental stress promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis through CRP and proinflammatory cytokines, so reducing the levels of CRP and proinflammatory cytokines in the body is a feasible strategy to delay the occurrence and development of tumor, especially for patients with increased inflammatory activity before treatment. IL-1 and IL-6 antagonists inhibit HPA signaling pathways, which may prolong survival time and improve prognosis in tumor patients. Anti-depressants have also been shown to reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines, improving depressive symptoms while reducing inflammatory activity. Consequently, further studies on the inhibitors of CRP and proinflammatory cytokines to inhibit the release of CRP and proinflammatory cytokines are conducive to delaying tumor occurrence, proliferation and metastasis, which can significantly improve the prognosis of tumor patients.\nThere are three different subtypes of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs): endothelial-type nitric oxide synthase, neuronal-type nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). iNOS overexpression promotes angiogenesis and accelerates tumor cell invasion and progression, which is related to the low survival of tumor patients. The HPA axis activated by chronic mental stress causes an increase in stress hormone levels, including cortisol, and then cortisol activates iNOS-mediated signal transduction pathways, resulting in an increase in nitric oxide (NO) levels. NO is a potentially destructive reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that can produce peroxynitrite and nitrogen trioxide through superoxide reactions and cause DNA damage. The increase of iNOS level induced by stress can therefore increase the production of RNS in tumor cells and interfere with the DNA repair process to induce DNA damage, thus promoting tumor occurrence and development.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> High levels of NO induce growth, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells and angiogenesis, while low levels of NO are associated with cytotoxicity, which can induce apoptosis and antitumor effects. In addition, prolonged exposure to high concentrations of NO also leads to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. The biphasic effect of NO depends on the positioning, expression, and activity of the NOS subtype, the concentration of NO, and the duration of NO exposure. NO’s extensive physiological functions, complex mechanisms and concentration dependence pose great challenges to researchers. Overall, iNOS overexpression and the subsequent increase in NO have broad implications in malignancies. Therefore, iNOS is a potential target for eliminating the harmful effects of mental stress on tumorigenesis and development. NOS inhibitors are a novel topic of research and may be used to weaken the DNA damage and reduce the tumorigenic effects produced by RNS.\nTwist protein is a highly conserved family of alkaline helix-loop-helix transcription factors, including Twist1 and Twist2, which are the major regulators of embryonic development and are significantly activated in tumors, thus driving tumor invasion and metastasis. Twist downregulates the level of E-cadherin and induces the activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway to improve the invasion and metastasis ability of tumor cells. The downregulation of E-cadherin leads to reduced intercellular adhesion, which is conducive to the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. EMT converts epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells that promote tumor cell metastasis through severe destruction of cell-cell connectivity and extensive restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, the overexpression of Twist is associated with the proliferation, differentiation, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Stress activates the HPA axis and SNS, causing an increase in stress hormone levels in circulation, including cortisol. This increase in stress hormone release upregulates the expression of Twist, which changes the tumor microenvironment by lowering E-cadherin levels to induce EMT pathway activation and promote angiogenesis and tumor cell metastasis. This evidence suggests that E-cadherin can serve as one of the potential targets of Twist. However, the relationship between Twist and E-cadherin has not been completely confirmed in clinical studies and needs to be verified by subsequent studies.\nIn addition to the above pathways, stress can also affect the development of tumor through other factors, for example, stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), also known as the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)/Hsp90-organizing protein. Stress causes high expression of STIP1, which promotes tumor metastasis and disease progression through activation of the focal adhesion kinase/AKT/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) signaling pathway. Therefore, the upregulation of STIP1 is carcinogenic and enhances the viability and invasion of tumor cells. In addition, a subgroup of MMPs, namely, MMP-2 and MMP-9, are considered important for inflammation and tumor metastasis. Stress can increase sympathetic activity to increase the levels of circulating catecholamines, which are positively associated with the tissue expression of MMPs that promote invasion. Furthermore, serotonin is a neuromodulator with neuro-transmitter and neuroendocrine functions that contributes to the occurrence of tumors. Chronic stress causes elevated serotonin levels that promote both tumor bone metastasis through the runt-related transcription factor 2/parathyroid hormone-related protein/receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB ligand pathway and the Warburg effect through activation of serotonin receptor 2B, providing bioenergy and meeting anabolic needs for cell survival and proliferation. Chronic mental stress has more or less influence on the occurrence and development of tumor through the above pathways, which can provide new ideas for tumor targeted therapy.\nIn conclusion, with the deepening of tumor research, targeted drugs have become an important part of antitumor therapy. Stress participates in the development of tumors by activating multiple signaling pathways and cytokines. These studies of the stress-related pathways reviewed in this paper provide us with important clues. Chronic mental stress can not only promote tumorigenesis and development by downregulating the level of BDNF and increasing the production of IGF2/IGF1R and CRP, but also promote tumorigenesis and development by other ways such as iNOS and Twist 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B32]</u>. Blocking or inhibiting these signal pathways have important therapeutic significance, which can prolong the survival time of cancer patients and improve the prognosis. However, these mechanisms need to be further studied and confirmed to provide potential strategies for follow-up targeted therapy research. Successful management of stress can improve abnormal activation of the neuroendocrine and immune systems, potentially affecting tumor development and progression. Therefore, inhibitors of stress-related pathways and cytokines can be used as potential targeted anticancer drugs, and the application of targeted drugs helps to reduce the impact of stress on cancer patients, and then reduce tumor metastasis and recurrence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Pseudoaneurysms of the left ventricle have a tendency to rupture, leading to death if there is no surgical treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of false aneurysms of the left ventricle, followed by cardiac surgery, trauma, and infection.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> This study retrospectively analyzed the surgical experience with left ventricular pseudoaneurysms.\nFrom January 2012 to December 2016, seven patients (four males and three females, mean age was 55.1 ± 14.0 years) underwent operation for pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricle in Fu Wai Hospital. Left ventricular true aneurysms were excluded from this study. Five of the left ventricular pseudoaneurysms were discovered after transmural myocardial infarction, two patients with a postsurgical pseudoaneurysm. Chest tightness, shortness of breath could be found in two cases, angina pectoris in two cases, manifestations of angina pectoris complicated with congestive heart failure in three cases. At the time of hospital admission, cardiac ultrasound and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were suggestive of a pseudoaneurysm formation. Mean pseudoaneurysm neck was 25.2±13.2 mm, mean pseudoaneurysm diameter 60.3 ± 37.0 mm, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction 46.8 ± 11.7% (range: 30- 60%). There were two cases with mitral insufficiency and one case with tricuspid regurgitation. Pseudoaneurysm thrombus could be found in six cases. Coronary angiography showed that five patients had coronary artery lesions. The median interval between myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery and diagnosis was 3 months.\nVarious techniques were used to obliterate the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. In six patients with a defect located close to the basal part of the left ventricle, the ventricular defect was closed with a patch of Gore-Tex or Dacron to avoid potential distortion of the heart structures or excessive traction on the edges of the defect. The repair was performed via midline sternotomy with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass without embolic, bleeding, or mechanical complications. The capsule of pseudoaneurysm was not resected but rather was used as a second layer over the patch for reinforcing the reconstructed ventricular wall and hemostasis. Attention should be paid to the prevention of coronary artery injury. In one patient with postinfarction pseudoaneurysm, the occluded anterior descending artery became entrapped in the repair and was not bypassed. Occlusion was performed in one patient through left anterolateral fifth intercostal space without cardiopulmonary bypass. Occlusion with an atrial septum defect (ASD) septal occluder (12 mm, Starway medical technology, V150801122039) was performed in this patient 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. After discharge from the hospital, all patients were followed up in our center using two-dimensional echocardiographic examination.\nThe mean postoperative hospital stay was 9.8 ± 3.1 days, mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 134.2 ± 51.7 min, mean aortic cross-clamping time was 89.8 ± 38.6 min, and mean postoperative ventilation time was 30.0 ± 18.7 h. No complications such as tracheotomy occurred. The mean follow-up time was 2.7 ± 0.6 years. All seven patients survived and discharged. No patient required reoperation.\nAcquired left ventricular pseudoaneurysms develop after transmural myocardial infarction (55% in reviews), surgery (33%), trauma (7%), or infection (5%).通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Rupture of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction usually leads to acute pericardial tamponade and immediate death. A few patients can survive if an adherent thrombus or pericardial adhesions seal the rupture and contain the bleeding. Postsurgical pseudoaneurysms occur after replacement of the mitral valve or arise on a previous ventriculotomy. The complication occurs in 0.02- 2.0% of mitral valve replacements. Predisposing factors include resection of the posterior leaflet, overzealous decalcification of the annulus, insertion of an oversized prosthesis, and redo-mitral valve replacement (as was the case in this series), especially if the stent of a bioprosthesis has eroded the posterior ventricular wall. This study included five cases of myocardial infarction complicated with ventricular aneurysm formation, one case after Bentall surgery and one case after mitral bioprosthesis valve replacement surgery. Pseudoaneurysm (diameter 19 mm) was located between the left ventricular posterior wall of mitral annulus near right atrial side and left atrium.\nWhen the diagnosis is established, surgical correction is usually mandatory. Surgery is urgently recommended when a pseudoaneurysm is discovered within the first 2–3 months after myocardial infarction because the onset of rupture is unpredictable. However, when the diagnosis is made years after myocardial infarction or surgery, the urgency and even the need for operation is determined by symptoms rather than by risk of rupture. If the preoperative circulation is not stable, intra-aortic balloon pump should be implanted as early as possible for adjuvant therapy. The size and location of the pseudoaneurysm determine the surgery. If a small chronic neck, aneurysm neck ligation can be directly closed. In patients with a defect located close to the basal part of the left ventricle (four cases), the side wall (two cases) of the ventricular defect was closed with a patch of Gore-Tex or Dacron to avoid potential distortion of the heart structures or excessive traction on the edges of the defect, then using the sandwich suture method for reinforcement with 4-0 double needle and felt piece. If caused by myocardial infarction ventricular pseudoaneurysm, coronary artery bypass graft should be performed, to improve the curative effect, reduce recurrence, and patch tear at the same time. In this study, one patient was unable to undergo revascularization for myocardial infarction.\nAlthough the conventional treatment is surgical intervention, transcatheter device closure is emerging as a new alternative for high-risk surgical candidates,通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> which was first described in 2004, the experience is still limited to a few reports, even large referral centers have limited experiences. As there is little guidance in the literature, device selection needs to be individualized depending on the location and size of the pseudoaneurysm, and adjacent structures. Several individual case reports have described the successful use of septal occluders, ventricular septal defect occluders, and coils. The margins may be necrotic and friable and give way during device placement or subsequently. To reduce device instability and the associated risk of device dislodgement, oversize ratios of 1.2- 2.0 have been reported for the Amplatzer septal occluder in previous studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> In this case, postsurgical pseudoaneurysm occurred after Bentall surgery. Pseudoaneurysm neck is located in the side wall, aneurysm neck is small (about 8.5 mm) if no thrombus. Since this patient had the peripheral vascular disease, occlusion was performed through left anterolateral fifth intercostal space. We oversized the device by 6 mm (oversize ratio: 1.4), occlusion with an ASD septal occluder (12 mm, Starway medical technology, V150801122039) was performed. The lateral thoracotomy approach avoided sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass, reducing the significant morbidity associated with surgery. The patient had a short hospital stay.\nIn the treatment of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm, a traditional surgical technique can be used for repair. Furthermore, through a small incision, percutaneous repair of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm might be a good option for patients with high surgical risk.\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

In about 70%-95% of cases, aortic rupture occurs in the distal ligament of the left subclavian artery, whereas in the remaining patients rupture occurs in the ascending aorta above the aortic valve.1 In patients involved in a traffic accident, trauma to the aortic sinus and coronary artery is rarely seen. Therefore, in these patients, coronary artery trauma is often misdiagnosed as coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. In this case, we focus on a male patient (age 42 years) who survived in a traffic accident that took place in Zhengzhou, China, resulting in aortic sinus and left coronary artery trauma. However, this patient was misdiagnosed as having coronary atherosclerotic heart disease in another hospital.\nAortic trauma always occurs in the arterial ligament. Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) may involve aortic dilatation, intramural aortic hematoma, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, aortic dissection, or aortic rupture2,3 and requires immediate surgical correction. If untreated, the 24 h mortality rate in AAS patients is 30%.4 The diagnostic methods for thoracic aortic trauma include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). These diagnostic approaches have a 95% sensitivity and specificity, and the TEE method can immediately be used in patients that are unstable.2 However, due to the increase in heart rate, in patients with aortic sinus and coronary artery trauma, the CT method does not accu- rately diagnose type of aortic trauma. In addition, because of the extended examination time, MRI is not suitable for unstable patients. However, the TEE method is more suitable for AAS patients, although this approach is not well tolerated in several patients. Thus, it is a challenge for physicians to diagnose and treat AAS patients, especially patients with aortic trauma.\nThe patient was a male (42 years of age) from local province, height 175 cm, weight 120 kg, with no history of smoking, and was healthy prior to the accident. The patient was hit by a bus when he was crossing the road on August 14, 2016. His left anterior chest was impacted by the front of the bus and he fell down, about 10 m away from the site, hitting the road with his back first.\nThe patient was sent to the local hospital, and chest CT examination showed a fractured sternum and left clavicle. The patient showed stable vital signs, and no signs of chest distress were observed. Therefore, the patient was treated by internal fixation of the clavicular fracture, and a rib claw plate was placed to stabilize the sternal fracture. After surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and rested for 30 days, and thereafter transferred to a general ward. When the patient was allowed for out of bed activities, symptoms such as asthma and decreased exercise tolerance were complained. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the Internal Medicine-Cardiovascular Department. After being admitted to the Department of Cardiology, the patient's troponin level, a marker of myocardial injury, was 0.4 mg/L. Clinical tests indicated clinical symptoms of acute heart failure and angina, but traumatic heart vascular injury was not considered after one month after injury. The patient was diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy primarily and was highly suspected of acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, the patient was given antiplatelet drugs, including aspirin, for treatment.\nA coronary angiography (CAG) procedure showed that the left main coronary artery was blocked. To correct this defect, the patient was admitted to our hospital for treatment. Because the patient did not present with risk factors of coronary arteries arteriosclerosis such as hypertension or diabetes, physicians considered the diagnosis of trauma-associated aortic lesions involving coronary artery.5 Aortic CTA and TEE were performed, however CTA analysis did not identify aortic dissection. The patient did not tolerate TEE, however, transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a floating intima in the aorta, severe aortic insufficiency, severe incompetence of the mitral valve, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension . There-fore, antiplatelet medication was immediately terminated and 3 days later the patient underwent exploratory thoracotomy. During surgery, aortic sinus circumferential transection and blockage of the left main coronary artery were observed, and the patient underwent Bentall and mitral valve replacement, as well as three tricuspid valvuloplasty . The aortic occlusion time during surgery was 47 min, and the cardiopulmonary bypass time was 63 min. After surgery, transthoracic echocardiography confirmed that all artificial valves worked sufficiently. The patient felt good; symptoms such as asthma and decreased exercise tolerance disappeared.\nHalf a year after treatment, the patient recovered well and symptoms such as asthma and chest distress were no longer observed. During CT examination, no abnormalities in the aortaorcoronary artery were observed.\nIn thoracic injuries, mitral valve prolapse and trauma to the aorta may occur, and in many cases (about 25%), these are caused due to motor vehicle fatalities.6 Both CT and TEE methods have a high sensitivity and specificity in thoracic injury.1 Patients with aortic sinus and coronary artery trauma have an increased heart rate which is a challenge for accurately diagnosing aortic trauma by CT analysis. Although severe aortic insufficiency can be identified with TEE, limitations still exist when diagnosing aortic sinus trauma.删除4：<u>7</u>\nAortic sinus injuries occur during percutaneous coronary intervention surgery. In 1999, Ishibashi et al8 reported aortic sinus injuries during percutaneous coronary intervention operation. Moreover, in 2007, Vianna et al9 reported that spontaneous aortic dissection was limited to the sinus of Valsalva, and involved the left main coronary artery during catheterization interventions. The incidence rate of this complication was 0%-0.008% for diagnostic catheterization, and 0.15%-0.06% for angioplasty proced- ures .9 This complication always occurred in the right coronary artery.删除4：<u>10</u>\nDuring surgery of our patient, we noticed that instead of only the right aortic sinus, all aortic valve leaflets and sinuses were damaged. This indicated that the patients' aortic dissection could not be caused by coronary angiography. On the other hand, aortic dissection is associated with hypertension (high blood pressure) and other connective tissue disorders. Most individuals (72%-80%) who present with aortic dissection have a previous history of hypertension.11 However, our patient did not have any prior history of hypertension, autoimmune disease, or smoking. Moreover, prior to the traffic accident, our patient tolerated heavy physical labor.\nWe highly suspected that our patient suffered from coronary artery trauma instead of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. During surgery, we identified aortic sinus circumferential transection and blockage of the left main coronary artery. Aortic sinus lesion often causes coronary injury. Ischemic cardiomyopathy caused by coronary injury following trauma is rare while coronary arteries arteriosclerosis heart disease is more common, and can be easily misdiagnosed as coronary disease.\nTo treat coronary arteries arteriosclerosis heart disease, coronary artery bypass grafting can be performed under cardiac arrest or in a heart beating state. Because coronary arteries are located on the surface of the heart, the heart will not be opened during surgery to examine the internal structure of the heart. However, during traumatic aortic disease, the site of injury is in the ascending aorta, therefore, surgery must be performed under extracorporeal circu- lation and the heart must be opened to examine the internal structure. If aortic lesions are only present in the ascending aorta and aortic valve, Bentall surgery may be considered for treatment. In this case, artificial blood vessels are placed and damaged aortic valves and coronary arteries repaired. Coronary artery bypass grafting for coronary disease as well as Bentall operations for aortic lesions are very different in nature, therefore, the clinical diagnosis of patients is of utmost importance.\nAortic sinus injuries are associated with acute aortic syndrome, such as Stanford type A aortic dissection.12 These patients present with symptoms such as a tearing pain in the anterior thoracic. However, several AAS patients who presented with typical symptoms of coronary heart disease were not diagnosed until CAG was performed. AAS patients were given antiplatelet medication, such as aspirin, however this type of medication is fatal to these patients .13 In recent years, physicians have realized that an increasing number of AAS patients are at a higher risk of diagnosis and treatment than others. In general, AAS should be considered when patients present with pectoralgia. Since TEE can identify changes in cardiac structure and function, it is a very useful tool in patients with AAS.14,15 Moreover, patients should never be recommended to take antiplatelet medication before the diagnosis is final.\nIn conclusions, AAS should be considered when patients present with pectoralgia, and patients should never be given antiplatelet medication before definite diagnosis.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2018.02.006</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and aimed to assess the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of a food-borne outbreak caused by Salmonella Aberdeen. Furthermore, the molecular biological characteristics of the outbreak isolates were detected and analyzed. From June 10 to 12, 2018, an enteritis outbreak affected 75 employees in the Fushan district of Yantai, Shandong province, China, including 33 males and 42 females. The mean age of the patients was 34.2 ± 5.3 years. An epidemiological investigation revealed that all infected employees had eaten the lunch provided by a catering company on June 9, 2018. In total, 22 samples, including four feces samples, five surplus food samples, eight cooking utensils used by the catering company, and five samples of chicken and eggs from the market where the food raw materials were purchased, were collected.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Of the 22 samples, six (27.2%) were tested positive for Salmonella Aberdeen (O11:Hi;1,2), including three isolates from feces (3/4, 75%) and three from surplus foods (3/5, 60%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) results showed the highly close correlation among the isolates, which were digested using the restriction enzyme nucleases XbaI (96.8%) and BlnI (100%) (Takara, Dalian, Liaoning, China) according to the PulseNet standardized PFGE protocol.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> The PFGE patterns were analyzed using BioNumerics, Version 6.0 (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium).\nNine virulence genes, including Salmonella enterotoxin genes (stn), pilus gene Fimbrin (fimA), virulence island genes (invA, mgtC, siiE, sseL, sopB), virulence plasmid genes (spvC) and virK, were detected in Salmonella, and their primers were designed according to GenBank. The results showed that six virulence genes, namely stn, fimA, virK, invA, mgtC, and siiE rather than sseL, sopB, and spvC, were detected in all six isolates.\nFifteen different antibiotic drugs, for example, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ampicillin-sulbactam, imipenem, tetracycline, nalidixic, erythromycin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, cefotaxime (CTX), cefazolin (CFZ), gentamicin, compound sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin, were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility with the broth microdilution method of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The results showed that all six isolates were sensitive to all tested drugs except CFZ. Thirteen drug-resistant genes of Salmonella, including BlaTEM, BlaSHV, BlaOXA-1, BlaOXA-2, BlaPER, BlaCMY, CTX-M group I, CTX-M group II, CTX-M group III, CTX-M group IV, Mcr-1, Mcr-2, and InvA genes, were detected using polymerase chain reaction in capillary gel electrophoresis (QIAxcel Advanced, Hilden, Germany). The results showed that the CTX-M group II (351 bp) and CTX-M group IV (474 bp) were in all isolates.\nThe epidemiological investigation showed the shortest, longest, and average incubation periods were 1, 88, and 14 h, respectively. The clinical symptoms of the 75 workers mainly included diarrhea (89.3%, 67/75), abdominal pain (89.3%, 67/75), increased C-reactive protein (CRP) level (77.3%, 58/75), nausea (65.3%, 49/75), fever (52.0%, 39/75), and vomiting (45.3%, 34/75).\nSalmonella Aberdeen is rarely reported and does not cause typical food-borne outbreaks abroad. In China, the first food poisoning caused by Aberdeen was reported in 1964.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> During 1976 to 1980, Aberdeen detection rate was 0.39% (105/27183) in Salmonella enterica. There was 3% of Aberdeen in 807 Salmonella strains isolated from 24,895 fecal samples during 2006 to 2007 as China joined WHO Global Salm-Surv.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>\nThe same serotypes were isolated from the retained food and patient stool samples of the outbreak, and the PFGE results showed that the isolated strain had a high similarity (≥96.8%); thus, this food-borne outbreak was typically caused by Salmonella Aberdeen. According to epidemiological evidence, the outbreak occurred because the food processing environment of the catering was poor and raw and cooked foods were not kept separate during processing, thus allowing for cross-contamination.\nThe incubation period of Aberdeen infection is similar to that of other Salmonella enterica, including Salmonella typhimurium/enteritidis. The clinical symptoms mainly include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and increased CRP levels. We confirmed that the isolates contained stn, fimA, virK, invA (salmonella pathogenicity island [SPI]-1), mgtC (SPI-3), and siiE (SPI-4). Stn is an enterotoxin gene and is an important virulence factor encoding products that can induce intestinal juice secretion as the study of Salmonella typhimurium infection mechanism indicated. FimA as a fimbriae gene helps bacteria adhesion to animal cells and promotes its colonization. VirK is a regulatory gene that mainly facilitates diffusion of bacterial toxins in the host. InvA plays an important role in the invasion of Salmonella into intestinal M cells. MgtC is a virulence factor located in SPI-3 and allows bacteria to survive in macrophages and low-magnesium environments. SiiE is located in SPI-4 and it aids bacterial adhesion to the epithelium. Diarrhea and abdominal pain are the main symptoms for diagnosis of Salmonella Aberdeen infection, and CRP levels should be widely tested in routine blood tests.\nAll patients with severe symptoms showed remarkable improvement following CTX and levofloxacin injections after 3 to 7 days. In order to analyze the relationship between their phenotypes and genotypes, the antimicrobial resistance and the resistance genes of the isolates were investigated. The results showed that all six isolates were resistant to CFZ, but resistance genes showed they all contained CTX-M group II and CTX-M group IV. The results of this study are consistent with the results of widespread distribution and prevalence of the CTX-M gene sub-type in Salmonella in China.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> CTX-M type extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) is a new type of ESBL gradually recognized and with increasingly large family members. Its main phenotype shows elevated level resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics.

The infratemporal fossa type B (ITFB) approach exposes the petrous apex, clivus, and horizontal segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and is used to remove tumors in this area.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The classical ITFB approach to fully exposing the horizontal segment of the ICA includes subtotal resection of the petrous bone, removal of the anterior wall of the external auditory canal and zygomatic arch, resection of the articular disc and condylar process of the mandible, downward traction of the mandible, and transection of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve and middle meningeal artery.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\nClinical practice has shown that some patients have lesions mainly located in the zygomatic arch and middle ear cavity. These lesions may extend downward into the temporomandibular joint or upward into the middle skull base or temporal lobes, and may not extend deep into the horizontal segment of the ICA. A modified ITFB approach has been proposed to remove tumors at these sites, while retaining the integrity of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve and the middle meningeal artery, and not exposing the horizontal section of the ICA. This report describes our experience using the modified ITFB approach to resect lateral skull base tumors, and explores the surgical indications for use of the modified ITFB approach in lateral skull base surgery and outcomes of its application.\nThis study was approved by the Review Committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital and conforms to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The modified ITFB approach was utilized by surgeons in the Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery of Beijing Tiantan Hospital to remove lateral skull base tumors from six patients between August 2014 and August 2017. Patients were included if they had lesions located in the middle ear cavity, zygomatic arch, temporomandibular joint, middle skull base, or temporal lobes, but not invading the horizontal segment of the ICA.\nBefore surgery, all patients underwent routine examination of the ear, head and neck, including the external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, and movements of the facial expression muscles. Facial nerve (FN) function was assessed using the House-Brackmann (HB) scale. Auditory function was evaluated by pure tone audiometry (PTA) at thresholds of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The level of hearing was classified based on pure tone average (the average air conduction hearing thresholds across the four frequencies) according to the standards recommended by the World Health Organization in 1997.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Normal hearing was defined as 0 to 25 dB hearing level (HL), mild hearing loss as 26 to 40 dB HL, moderate hearing loss as 41 to 60 dB HL, severe hearing loss as 61 to 80 dB HL and extremely severe hearing loss as >80 dB HL. Each patient underwent computed tomography and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the temporal bone.\nAll operations were performed under general anesthesia; the surgical procedure is shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary Video http://links.lww.com/CM9/A316. The modified ITFB approach was utilized in six patients for tumor removal during the study period. The six patients included four males and two females, of mean age 37.5 years (range, 3.0-65.0 years). Before surgery, all six patients showed hearing loss, including one with mild (PTA 35 dB HL) and three with moderate conduction hearing loss (PTA 50, 50, 55 dB HL, respectively) and two with extremely severe sensorineural hearing loss (both PTA >80 dB HL). In addition, three patients had tinnitus, one had purulent ear discharge, one had facial paralysis (HB grade II), and one had headache.\nAll six patients underwent microscope-guided radical resection of the tumor, with enhanced MRI 1 week after surgery confirming the absence of residual tumor in all six patients. Pathologic examination showed that two patients had giant cell reparative granulomas and that the other four patients had giant cell tumor of the bone, epidermoid cyst, squamous cell carcinoma, and mature teratoma, respectively. None of the patients experienced vascular injuries, including those of the ICA, jugular bulb, and sigmoid sinus, with mean blood loss being <100 mL.\nAfter the surgery, four patients with mild or moderate conductive hearing loss before operation experienced severe conductive hearing loss (PTA increased to 60 dB HL for the patient with mild conduction hearing loss and by 10 to 15 dB HL for the three patients with moderate conduction hearing loss before the surgery) and two still had severe sensorineural hearing loss (both PTA >80 dB HL, identical to those before the surgery). One patient, with normal FN function before surgery, developed facial paralysis due to tumor invasion and resection of the FN during the operation, resulting in a postoperative FN function of HB grade VI. The patient having preoperative FN function of HB grade II showed worsening of FN function one week after surgery to HB grade III, but recovered to HB grade II after one year. The FN function of the other four patients was normal after surgery. Because the lesions in three patients had invaded the dura mater of the middle cranial fossa, and even involved the temporal lobe, the invaded dura and intracranial tumors were removed, and artificial dura was used to repair the defective dura. Head computed tomography 6 h after surgery showed that none of the patients experienced intracranial hemorrhage, with follow-up for 2 to 6 years showing no leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. All patients were evaluated by enhanced MRI once yearly after surgery. None of the patients experienced tumor recurrence or serious postoperative complications, such as cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea, intracranial hemorrhage, intracranial infection, hemiplegia, and death.\nAlthough the ITFB approach was originally designed for the removal of epidural lesions, it has also been used to remove intracranial lesions.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> In this study, the lesions in three patients invaded the dura or even the temporal lobe and were successfully removed using the modified ITFB approach. This approach was especially suitable for removal of tumors located in the middle skull base and temporal lobe and invading the middle ear and temporomandibular joint. In addition, the routine closure of the external auditory canal and eustachian tubes, and packing the operative cavity with fat could reduce the likelihood of cerebrospinal fluid leakage or intracranial infection.\nSimilar to classic ITFB, modified ITFB allows direct microscopic exposure of the lesions, as well as maximally protecting the dura mater, ICA, FN, and other important structures during removal of the lesions. Compared with the classic ITFB approach, the modified ITFB approach results in better retention of the mandibular nerve and middle meningeal artery, without exposing the horizontal segment of the ICA. The modified ITFB approach also avoids facial numbness in the innervated area of the mandibular nerve and delayed bleeding resulting from the resection of the middle meningeal artery, as well as maximally protecting the ICA from injury. This approach also reduces the occurrence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage and intracranial infection.\nThe major disadvantages of the modified ITFB approach include the need to sacrifice hearing function and the temporomandibular joint, similar to those encountered using the classic ITFB approach.\nIn summary, the modified ITFB approach has great advantages in the resection of lateral skull base lesions involving the petrous apex, zygomatic arch, temporomandibular joint, and even the temporal lobe. This approach can also reduce complications associated with the classic ITFB approach, such as damage to the horizontal segment of the ICA, mandibular nerve, and middle meningeal artery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

As to ophthalmology, transition from traditional hospitalized surgery to a predominant outpatient mode could be a solution. Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) is one of the largest and leading ophthalmic centers in China, where over 65,000 surgeries are performed annually. ZOC is now working on the transition toward outpatient surgery mode, improving both performance and efficiency.\nExcept for orbit surgeries and rare serious systemic conditions, outpatient surgery is the standard practice in developed countries. In the USA, 99% ophthalmic surgeries are performed in an outpatient setting.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Obviously, outpatient surgery is associated with a shorter waiting list, a lower cost, a shorter hospital stay, and reduced investment in medical facilities and personnel. Surprisingly, it also comes with less postoperative complications, better visual prognosis, and patient compliance.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Therefore, transition to outpatient surgery seems an appropriate choice.\nWe have been working on this transition over the past 3–4 years through various challenging situations. First, we have many complicated cases referred nationally and we used to spend more time with each case when the patient is hospitalized. While outpatient mode allows us to handle more patients, it also makes doctors avoid accepting complicated cases, as simple cases in large quantity are associated with better financial reward. Second, patient compliance becomes an issue. Patients with lower level of education have difficulty to understand surgery-related care.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> The problem is magnified when total communication time is reduced between doctors/nurses and patients in the outpatient setting. Some financially restricted patients are intentionally lost to follow-up. Third, unlike the developed countries, China does not have a mature social supporting system. There are very few community workers and volunteers to help patients postoperatively, either inside a hospital or at offsite locations. Fourth, the cost for an outpatient surgery might increase due to high costs for transportation and accommodation while traditional hospitalization only charges a nominal fee. Last, reimbursement can be a problem for some outpatient surgeries, due to policy gaps from the government administration.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Altogether, these factors restrict the convenience and willingness of the outpatient mode.\nRegarding dealing with these challenges, we have some suggestions: first, we propose that improvement on the medical personnel training is critical. An updated outpatient care-oriented training plan will be needed.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Second, an expansive detailed protocol should be created for each clinical scenario to ensure consistence in the practice in an outpatient setting. Detailed protocols should be established for each surgical procedure, and in particular, for the complicated cases. Detailed instructions should be given regarding how to communicate with patients to deliver the important information in a relatively limited time, such as follow-up plan, notes on important postoperative signs, and safely transfer of care plan when patients return to local doctors. Third, the hospital should arrange regular teaching rounds for complicated cases. A bonus system could be in place to encourage doctors to accept complicated cases. Fourth, a supplementary support system needs to be established, and sample components include ophthalmology care navigator, both on-site and off-site; a concise but detailed instruction booklet for each surgical procedure for patients to take home; 24/7 telephone consultation support; emergency \"green path\" . Fifth, volunteers and social workers with certain medical knowledge and familiar with hospital settings and resources can be very helpful. If possible, hospitals could negotiate contracts with off-site hotels and commercial transportation to provide affordable service for the patients. Last, insurance companies and government need to update the insurance policies to encourage the operation of the outpatient settings; financial stimulus for outpatient surgery from administration could help facilitate this transition. For the financial challenged patients, the government and hospitals could work together to provide financial aid, and in some cases, free humane service for emergent surgeries.\nIn conclusion, we have achieved encouraging clinical outcomes in the ophthalmology care. The concerns and solutions proposed here require a systemic reform involving the government, insurance companies, hospitals, and social support. We hope that the experience from ZOC can help understanding and facilitating the transition, and ultimately improving the quality and efficiency of the medical service, benefiting more patients nationwide.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Hence, this study was carried out to investigate the association between DM and hypertension in BPH patients using a case-control design.\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the Committee for Ethical Affairs of the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants signed informed consent before enrollment. The study participants were selected from the Bladder Cancer and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Study in Chinese Population, which was a prospective study estimating the clinical effect of interventional therapy and the risk factors for bladder cancer and BPH.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> From September 2016 to October 2017, patients diagnosed with BPH, undergoing surgery for this disorder, and possessing all required data were embraced in this research. Patients experiencing prostate cancer, bacteriuria or pyuria, as well as undergoing previous prostate and urethral surgery were excluded from the study. All eligible patients were finally divided into two groups according to the presence of hypertension. Detailed medical history and physical examination results were obtained from all included patients, including age, weight, height, systolic blood pressure (SBP; mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (DBP; mmHg), international prostate symptom score (IPSS), maximum urine flow rate (Qmax), prostate ultrasonography for prostate volume (PV; ml), fasting blood sugar (FBS, ng/ml), and total prostate-specific antigen (t-PSA; ng/ml). The incident DM of this study was defined as FBS ≥7.0 mmol/L (1260 mg/L); hypertension was confirmed according to SBP and DBP. The incident hypertension of this study was defined as office BP with sitting SBP of ≥140 mmHg or sitting DBP of ≥90 mmHg; the hypertensive patients were then classified as mild, moderate, and severe hypertensive groups.\nAll analyses were carried out using the SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS Inc. USA). The percentage or mean with its standard deviation was calculated to summarize the frequency distributions of age, height, weight, PV, SBP, DBP, body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), FBS, t-PSA, IPSS, Qmax, hypertension, and DM using the one-way analysis of variance and Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test according to the properties of these variables. To investigate the association between DM and hypertension, the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using univariate analysis; then, we performed a logistic regression analysis to obtain adjusted ORs and their 95% CIs for age, BMI, t-PSA, IPSS, and Qmax. The statistical significance of differences among the three hypertensive groups was also measured using above analyses. A two-sided P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nUltimately, 327 patients were included in this study. Of them, there were 108 patients with hypertension and 219 patients without hypertension; the former contained 74 patients with mild hypertension, 27 with moderate hypertension, and 7 with severe hypertension. Besides, there were 32 DM patients and 295 non-DM patients. The mean age of all participants was 70.8 ± 7.4 years. The mean ages for the two groups were 70.6 ± 7.4 years and 71.3 ± 7.5 years, and there was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.390). The weight, BMI, DBP, and SBP in the nonhypertensive group were significantly lower than those in hypertensive group (P < 0.05 ), whereas the Qmax was significantly higher (P = 0.034). Table 1 provides the results of univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. In the unadjusted analysis, DM could increase risk of hypertension by 1.244 times in all BPH patients (OR = 1.244, 95% CI = 0.584-2.649), and similar results were observed in patients with moderate and severe hypertension; however, the associations showed no significant difference (all P > 0.05). After adjusted analysis, the ORs were elevated to 1.853 times (95% CI = 0.51-6.737) in total hypertensive patients, 1.634 times (95% CI = 0.366–7.298) in mild hypertensive patients, 1.442 times (95% CI = 0.141–14.706) in moderate hypertensive patients, and 142.269 times in severe hypertensive patients.

Consistent with previous evidences, this case- control study indicated that BPH patients with DM had an increased risk of hypertension; however, unlike previous researches, our study showed a nonsignificant association. There might be two major reasons for this difference. First, the significant and positively relationship of DM with hypertension was really influenced by BPH, simplying that the development of BPH might exert a regulating effect on these two diseases. Second, the significant and positive correlation of DM with hypertension was not actually influenced by BPH, and the presented results were just due to insufficient sample sizes. In conclusion, the present case- control study suggested a positive but nonsignificant correlation between DM and hypertension in BPH patients. These results raise the question for further investigations of why the positive and significant association between DM and hypertension is still unidentified.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2016YFC0106300)</u> and the Technical Innovation Major Program of Hubei province 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2016ACA152)</u>.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Patients with spina bifida affecting the lumbar spine develop a range of congenital and acquired orthopaedic deformities. Foot deformities are among the most common, with an incidence of over 80%.1 Calcaneovalgus foot deformities are present in up to 35% of patients with low-level spina bifida; most commonly myelomeningocoele of lumbar levels 4 and 5.1,2 Calcaneovalgus deformity arises from weak or absent plantar flexors and invertors failing to oppose strong or spastic dorsiflexors and evertors.3,4,5,6 Ability to ambulate is related to the level of the neurological lesion, with better prognoses associated with lower lying lesions; 91% of young adults with a lumbar level 5 lesions and 57% of patients with a lumbar level 4 lesions remain ambulant.7 However, calcaneovalgus deformities cause primary weight bearing on the heels, leading to complications ranging from pressure ulcers to osteomyelitis.删除4：<u>4,6</u>\nEarly surgical reconstruction is advocated to prevent progression and rigidity of deformity.5,6,8 The aim of surgery is firstly to achieve a plantigrade, pain-free, stable foot amenable to bracing, and secondly to prevent secondary osseous deformities such as external tibial torsion. Several surgical techniques have been described including posterior transfer of the anterior tibialis tendon and complete anterolateral release of the extensor tendons as well as peroneus longus and brevis.5,8 The successful use of the Ilizarov technique in a paediatric series has also been described by Kelley et al.9 All the aforementioned techniques described involved paediatric populations, and there remains a paucity of literature regarding treatment of chronic calcaneovalgus feet in adults. This case report describes our experience using the Ilizarov technique in the reconstruction of an adult presenting with chronic calcaneo- valgus feet due to myelomeningocele of lumbar level 5.\nA 34-year-old lady with spina bifida, specifically myelomeningocoele of lumbar level 5, presented to the outpatient specialist orthopaedic clinic with bilateral calcaneovalgus feet deformities. Although ambulant, the bilateral calcaneovalgus feet deformities had caused recurrent pressure ulcers over her heels . This had led to multiple hospital admissions over the previous two years for cellulitis and infected ulcers, including two admissions for debridement of infected heel ulcers on her left, which had led to osteomyelitis. Examination of her feet revealed bilateral rigid calcaneovalgus deformities. Her left ankle was dorsiflexed to 45° and her right ankle to 40° with callosities over both her heels .\nManagement goals were discussed with the patient, and a decision was made to proceed with reconstruction of both feet using Ilizarov frames, with the aim of maintaining independent ambu- lation while minimising recurrent hospitalisations from pressure ulcers and infection. As the patient previously had numerous su- perficial skin and ulcer infections of the left foot and ankle, it was decided to proceed with reconstruction of the right foot and ankle first. This was to allow time to improve the skin condition of the left foot before reconstruction.\nAn Orthofix TL-HEX frame was used with 4 half pins inserted in the tibia supporting 2 circular rings. A third semi-circular foot ring was supported by 5 fine wires; 3 inserted into the calcaneus and 2 into the metatarsals. Finally, 2 Kirschner wires were passed through the second and third toe before attachment to the frame . Minimal deformity correction was done intraoperatively to prevent excessive soft tissue trauma and stretch .\nPostoperative recovery was uneventful with discharge on day 3. Deformity correction was done gradually over the subsequent 4 months , with fixed daily adjustments done by the patient and close weekly follow-up in clinic. The aim was for 3°－4° of correction per week, and at 4 months postoperatively, her foot was in neutral and removal of the frame was performed. A slight delay in frame removal was encountered as 3 months postoperatively it was noted her ankle was subluxing, and the frame was kept on longer following reduction of the ankle. A below knee cast was applied after removal of the frame, and full weight bearing as tolerated was allowed. Casting was kept for 6 weeks before the removal, and she was fitted with an ankle-foot orthosis. On review in clinic 4 weeks subsequently, the patient was pain-free, with a stable, plantigrade foot .\nEleven months after starting reconstruction of the right foot and ankle, reconstruction of the left foot and ankle was commenced. Again, an Orthofix TL-HEX frame was used with 4 half pins inserted in the tibia supporting 2 circular rings. The third semi-circular foot ring was supported by multiple fine wires, which were inserted in the calcaneus and metatarsals. Finally, 4 Kirschner wires were passed through the first through forth metatarsals before attachment to the frame. As with the previous reconstruction, minimal deformity correction was done intra-operatively to prevent excessive soft tissue trauma and stretch.\nPostoperative recovery was uneventful. Gradual deformity correction of 4°－5° per week was maintained, with close follow-up in clinic. After 2 months, her foot was in neutral and the frame was removed. Again, a below knee cast was applied with full weight bearing as tolerated. Casting was again kept for 6 weeks before fitting of an ankle-foot orthosis.\nManagement and reconstruction of chronic calcaneovalgus deformities in adults is complex, as chronicity often results in rigidity of deformities and secondary osseous deformities such as external tibial torsion. Ambulation is difficult due to crouch gait and loss of the normal toe off phase.4,6 In the proportion of patients who remain ambulant, pressure ulcers commonly develop over the heels. The management should therefore be tailored to the needs of individual patients, but even in non-ambulant patientsreconstruction may be beneficial to allow footwear and facilitate positioning in a wheelchair. The aim of surgical reconstruction should be to achieve a plantigrade, stable, and brace-able foot.\nNo consensus has been established in the literature with regards to the best surgical approach. Rodrigues and Dias5 reviewed 76 patients with calcaneovalgus feet treated with either a complete anterior release (tenotomy of the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorium communis and extensor hallucis longus) or anterolateral release (associated tenotomy of the peroneus longus and brevis) for a mean of 4.66 years, with 81.5% achieving good results. Anterior tibialis tendon transfer to the calcaneus has also been described; Bliss and Meneleus8 reported on 46 such patients spanning over 12 years with only 4 feet remaining plantigrade. Park et al.6 reviewed 31 patients that underwent tibialis anterior tendon transfer, for a mean duration of 47 months. Twelve of these cases required accompanying osseous deformity correction, and there was no reported recurrence or worsening deformity noted in any of their patients.\nA case series of 28 lower limb reconstructions in children and adolescents using Ilizarov frames by Kelley et al.9 reported positive results. In their series, all 19 patients with foot and ankle deformities had reconstructed feet that were plantigrade and braceable.\nThe Ilizarov technique has been utilised since the 1950s to correct limb deformities. The basic components comprise of rings and connecting rods. Full rings provide the greatest degree of stability whereas half rings allow for increased access to the surgical site. The rings are connected with a minimum of four connecting rods and to the patient via at least two points of fixation.删除4：<u>10</u>\nThe Ilizarov technique provides several advantages. Firstly, correction of deformity is gradual, preventing trauma to and allowing stretch of the adjacent soft tissue, including overlying skin and neurovascular bundles. Secondly, direct access to overlying skin is possible, allowing close monitoring of the skin, which is often contracted and prone to complications in chronic deformities. In contrast, conventional surgical techniques requiring casting may result in complications such as skin necrosis, reported as high as 61%.删除4：<u>8</u>\nIn this patient, the Ilizarov technique was preferred as, in addition to the advantages listed above, it was deemed the rigidity and chronicity of deformity would not be amenable to correction purely with soft tissue release, transfer or tenotomy. The patient was also motivated, and had good social support to ensure compliance with the reconstructive process.\nPin site infections are the most common complication of Ilizarov frames, with reported rates of up to 100% in many case series.11,12,13,14 Pin site and wound care is therefore essential, and resolution has been reported in up to 97% of cases with good wound care and appropriate antibiotic use.15 Additionally, the need for daily adjustment of the frame further necessitates that patients should be carefully selected, as compliance to frame adjustment and pin site care over a prolonged period of months requires a diligent patient with good support.\nIn the 2 years before starting the reconstructive process, the patient was admitted over 10 times for various issues involving feet ulcers and infection. Following the index surgery, no further unplanned admissions were required. The patient regained independent and pain free ambulation, and was delighted with the reconstructive result.\nIn conclusion, untreated and chronic severe calcaneovalgus foot deformities secondary to spina bifida rarely persist to present in adulthood in the developed world. Management and reconstruction in the adult is more complex for multiple reasons including rigidity of deformity, skin and soft tissue contractures, as well as pressure sores and infection. The Ilizarov technique offers an effective method for reconstruction of the bony deformity, while allowing gradual correction of the associated soft tissue contractures, in the adult patient. While the use of an Ilizarov frame requires a compliant patient and a competent surgeon, in the right hands it can reconstruct bony as well as soft tissue chronic deformities, and restore function in the adult patient.\nNil.\nInformed consent has been obtained from the patient and relatives.\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.04.001.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.04.001</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

In addition to mobile communication, smartphones allow consumers to download third-party applications (apps) through an online mobile store. The Apple mobile app store and Google Play (Android) mobile app store has over 1.2 million apps and 1.6 million apps, respectively, and the number of apps continues to grow each year.1,2 This offers users a variety of apps with a broad range of functions to choose from.\nThere has been increasing interest among the public in using apps to improve health and fitness, and as a result, the number of apps focused on these issues has grown exponentially. There are over 100,000 health apps combined in the Apple and Google Play mobile app store.3 These health apps range from weight loss aids to asthma management.4,5 One target for health and fitness app de- velopers has been sleep and sleep hygiene. These apps have a broad range of functions, including smartalarm clocks, sleep aids, sound recording during sleep, and sleep analysis. Others are developing smartphones programs to aid healthcare professionals in screening patients for habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea.6 Despite increasing usage of health apps by the population, physicians still have limited experience with these apps in clinical practice.\nAs more consumers adopt sleep apps, physicians should be aware of the available apps, and be able to counsel patients appropriately on sleep app data. The purpose of this study is to review the current selection of apps available for sleep analysis, and to provide a resource to familiarize physicians with the most common sleep apps in current use.\nThe Apple (iOS App Store) mobile app store and Google Play mobile app store were searched for sleep analysis apps by one author (A.O.). The following search terms were used: sleep tracker, sleep apnea, sleep analysis, and sleep cycle. Sleep analysis apps targeted for consumer use were included. Alarm clock, sleep aid, snoring and sleep talk recorder, and fitness-tracker apps were excluded. In addition, sleep apps for health professionals as well as apps not related to sleep were excluded. Data were collected using store description and the developer’s website, including app name, functions, price, date of last update, user rating, number of user reviews, and developer information. Each app store was analyzed separately as some apps were found in both mobile app stores.\nThe Apple and Google Play mobile app store were searched in mid-June 2015. The search terms yielded a total of 593 and 723 unique apps in the Apple app store and Google Play app store, respectively. A total of 60 apps met the inclusion criteria, of which 51 were unique. Thirty-three (65%) apps were available in the Apple app store; 27 (53%) in the Google Play store; and 7 (14%) were found in both stores.\nThe average app price in the Apple store was $1.12, ranging from $0.00 to $9.99, and $0.58 in the Google play store, ranging from $0.00 to $4.49. Twenty (61%) Apple apps and 21 (78%) Google Play apps were free of charge. There were 42 unique developers for the 51 apps. There was minimal information on developers’ websites regarding prior experience handling and analyzing medical data.\nRatings were obtained from the mobile app store and had a rating scale of 1-5. Nine (27%) Apple apps and 2 (7%) Google Play apps did not have a rating listed. For the apps with available ratings, the average Apple app rating was 3.8 (range: 2.0-4.7) and the average Google Play app rating was 3.8 (range: 2.7-4.7).\nAll included apps were evaluated for functionality. Table 1 summarizes percentage of apps that include each feature. All 33 (100%) Apple apps and 27 (100%) Google Play apps report sleep duration, while reporting of sleep structure was more variable. The Apple apps showed the following: 23 (70%) had time spent awake; 21 (64%) had time in light sleep; 23 (70%) had time in deep sleep; and 6 (18%) had time in REM. The Google Play apps had 20 (74%) showing time spent awake; 21 (78%) time in light sleep; 21 (78%) time in deep sleep; and 7 (11%) time in REM.

Eight (24%) Apple apps and 3 (11%) Google Play apps provide graphs on movement during sleep. Almost half of the Apple apps (45%) record sound during sleep, while only a handful of Google Play apps (11%) could do the same. The majority of Apple apps (73%) featured a smart alarm, designed to wake the user during light sleep, whereas half the Google Play apps (56%) had this feature. Nine (27%) Apple apps and 8 (30%) Google Play apps included optional white noise to aid in initiating sleep. The majority of Google Play apps (63%) could record wake up mood or notes to track activities and its effect on sleep, compared to a few Apple apps (36%). Not many apps (18% Apple and 4% Google play) could record heart rate. Unique to Apple and the iPhone, 11 (33%) apps could sync data with the built-in iPhone Health app.\nTable 2 displays the ten most reviewed apps in the Apple and Google Play mobile app store. By far, the most reviewed app is the Sleep as Android app, only available from the Google Play store. For a two week trial, users have access to all features, including snore recorder and sleep aid. This app utilizes CAPTCHA technology for its smart alarm to ensure the user is awake and out of bed. To turn off the alarm, the user must scan a QR code located in the bathroom or shake the phone heavily. It also can sync to a commercially available smartwatch to track sleep using the watch’s built-in motion sensor, or accelerometer, and an anti-snoring feature that vibrates the watch when it detects snoring. The upgraded version, also a featured app, Sleep as Android Unlock, gives users unlimited access to the app’s features beyond the two week trial.\nTen most popular apps for iOS and android by number of user reviews.\n删除重复语句：<u>Ten most popular apps for iOS and android by number of user reviews.</u>\nThe Apple app with the most reviews is Sleep Cycle, also found in the Google Play store. While the app does not record sound, it does offer a sleep aid, and note taking capability to monitor a user’s habits and its effect on sleep. Using the smartphone’s camera, the app can measure heart rate on awakening by analyzing the color changes on the tip of the user’s finger by photoplethysmography, which measures the pulse wave using the smartphone’s flash as a light source and camera as a photo sensor.7,8 In addition, data on sleep analysis and heart rate can be integrated to the builtin Health app on newer iPhones.\nOne app was the first place winner at The Health Data Initiative Forum by the Institute of Medicine.9 The app, SleepBot, does not provide sleep structure data, but alternatively measures the amount of movement by the user during sleep. It can record sound during sleep, which can be played back in the morning, and lets users rate their sleep quality. The app also provides strategies for users to get to sleep, and information on different sleep disorders.\nFour apps were created by fitness companies, and most offered a number of other health apps on the developer’s website. In addition to tracking sleep, MotionX 24/7 also doubles as a pedometer, and calculates calories burned from walking. Sleep Better by Runtastic places more of an emphasis on the effect of daily habits, such as exercise, caffeine consumption, and even stress, on sleep. Smart Alarm Clock by Plus Sports and Sleep Time by Azumio features similar sleep structure analyses as other apps, and allows users to virtually back up recorded sleep data.\nEasyWakeup PRO is the oldest app featuring a smart alarm, created in 2008. Like SleepBot, it reports amount of movement instead of sleep structure, and can record notes and mood in a dream diary. It is the most expensive app offered at $9.99, and another app by the same developer, Easy Wakeup Classic, is available for half the price, but does not include dream diary capability. Good Night’s Sleep Alarm and Sleep Analyzer are two apps only available in the Google Play store, and offer similar sleep analyses as other apps. Good Night’s Sleep Alarm does require in-app purchases to access certain features, and Sleep Analyzer has the lowest rating of the apps featured, mainly due to unreliability of the alarm. Smart Sleep Manager is an app developed out of Japan with many different sleep reports for users to view. It offers a few relaxing sleep aid sounds to help users fall asleep faster and peacefully, but requires inapp purchase to access these.\nWith the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, the use of health-related apps, including sleep analysis apps, will only increase.10 Although sleep apps were not designed for medical use, patients may approach physicians with questions regarding the information obtained from these apps. Our goal was to review the major features provided by the current sleep analysis apps available for smartphones.\nEvery smartphone app analyzed on both platforms reported sleep duration, although reporting data on sleep structure, including time in light sleep, deep sleep, and REM, was inconsistent. To gather data on sleep structure, the reviewed apps rely on the smartphone’s built-in accelerometer to register movement during the night, and this measurement of human rest/activity cycles, also known as actigraphy, correlates decreasing amounts of movement to the transition from light to deep sleep. Each app has their own proprietary algorithm to relate the amount of movement detected by the accelerometer to specific stages of sleep. Actigraphy has received increased attention to assess patient’s sleep patterns as an alternative to polysomnogram.11 One study looked at healthy volunteers who underwent in-laboratory polysomnography while simultaneously using a featured sleep app, Sleep Time by Azumio. The authors found that there was no correlation between the polysomnogram findings and sleep app with regard to sleep efficiency, light sleep percentage, deep sleep percentage, or sleep latency.12 They reported the app was highly sensitive in detecting sleep, although had poor specificity, which confirmed previous studies.13,14 Bhat et al. advised that their findings could not be generalized to other sleep apps; however, no app provided information about the algorithms used to determine sleep structure, or cited scientific publications to back the accuracy of the app. More research should confirm the measurement validity of these apps and encourage further development of sleep app algorithms, which may help future researchers obtain data on sleep using an inexpensive format.15 To properly counsel patients on similar apps, the physician must be aware of the limitations of actigraphy and its use in smartphone apps that monitor sleep. Thus far, these apps cannot replace polysomnography in monitoring sleep.\nOne major attraction for users when downloading sleep apps is the smart alarm, which reportedly wakes the user at the optimal time. Users can set an alarm within the app to create a 30 min window during which the app would wake the user as they transition to light sleep. The app correlates the increased movement to light sleep, a time when users should be easily awakened. There is still research needed on this subject, and as mentioned before, actigraphy is not as accurate in detecting wakefulness. Currently, the perceived benefit of the smart alarm by users remains unclear.删除4：<u>16,17</u>\nFifteen Apple apps and seven Google Play apps could record sound during sleep. These apps utilize the smartphone’s built-in microphone to either record sound during the entire night’s duration, or selectively record sounds that exceed a pre-determined threshold. The ability to record sounds during sleep may benefit physicians screening patients who are unaware of potential habitual snoring. Habitual snoring has been found to be an increased risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity, and may hint at the possibility of obstructive sleep apnea.18 Although the apps are not intended for screening, its use in snoring identification in specific populations may be useful. Single patients who do not have a consistent bed partner may not be aware of their snoring.19 The authors also suggested the potential of snore recorder apps to track the efficacy of snoring interventions, such as oral appliances, in patients without a consistent bed partner. Only future studies can confirm the reliability of sound recorder apps for monitoring snoring therapy success.\nAn advantage of sleep apps is accurately listing the time a patient went to bed (time turning on the app), and time of sleep initiation, due to its high sensitivity in detecting sleep. In addition, twelve Apple apps and sixteen Google Play apps can record notes on their sleep quality (similar to a visual analog scale), any causes for difficulty falling asleep, habits that may affect sleep, such as coffee ingestion or exercise at night, and mood upon awakening. When evaluating patients for the first time, sleep physicians recommend use of a sleep diary to gather information about a patient’s sleep patterns.20 This is particularly critical for patients who may suffer from hypersomnia due to poor sleep hygiene, insomnia, or circadian or phase shift disorders.\nInformation from the app on time in bed, sleep initiation, and time of waking may serve as an adjunct to this paper sleep diary. One study comparing the use of a smartphone app to use of a website and paper diary for weight loss found that those in the smartphone group had a statistically significantly higher rate of adherence to selfmonitoring than those that used the website and paper diary.21 Since smartphones are consistently available throughout the day, patient recording is easier, and may allow for more complete sleep diaries. Future studies could assess the adherence rate of a sleep diary app to paper sleep diary in the management of sleep disorders.\nThis study has some limitations. This study only included apps used for sleep analysis and sleep tracking, and there were many other sleep apps, including apps that exclusively record snoring, which may be beneficial to physicians. In addition, we excluded sleep apps that were targeted for use by healthcare professionals that could be helpful in the management of patients with sleep disorders. Apps for wearable devices, such as the FitBit and Jawbone, were not included as well, and their accuracy in sleep analysis is unclear.22 We were also limited by the information available in the mobile app store and the developer’s website. The apps were not downloaded, thus more potential information regarding the app may be missing. Technology is constantly changing, and while new apps and devices are developed, our study provides an up-to-date review of the apps currently available for sleep analysis among the major smartphone operating systems.\nNone.\nDr. Gillespie receives research support from Inspire Medical and Olympus, and is a consultant for Olympus and Medtronic.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wjorl.2016.02.001</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

The onset of the disease is closely associated with ANCA, which is specific for myeloperoxidase-ANCA (MPO-ANCA) or proteinase 3-ANCA (PR3-ANCA).1 The pathogenesis of ANCA is well demonstrated through in vivo and in vitro studies but the mechanism of ANCA development largely remains unclear. Possible factors that could cause ANCA and the associated vasculitis include infection, neoplasms, and drugs including propylthiouracil, methimazole, and many others which could interact with macrophages/monocytes as well as T and B cells.2,3,4 AAV is characterized by necrotizing inflammation of the small vessel. Mortality may reach 90% if patients with AAV are left untreated. Despite adequate immunosuppressive therapy, the prognosis of patients with AAV remains poor.5 In previous studies, we found that the 5-year survival rate of AAV was about 70%, and infection was a common cause of the death.6 In a recent meta-analysis, AAV patients were found to have higher mortality than the general population.7 Currently, immunosuppressants are the standard treatment of AAV, but long-term of immunosuppressive therapy could cause many adverse effects, including increased rates of infections, malignancies and cardiovascular diseases.8 Therefore, the side-effects of immunosuppressant could be associated with increased mortality in AAV patients.\nRenal involvement, also known as ANCA associated glomerulonephritis (AGN), is one of the most common manifestations of AAV that could occur in more than half of the patients, and dialysis-dependency at disease onset is high.9,10 As studies point out that renal involvement is an important factor affecting the prognosis of patients with AAV, we focus on kidney damage in AAV in this review to further understand the disease and improve its prognosis.\nThe clinical presentations of renal involvement in AAV include hematuria, proteinuria or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis depending on the severity of vasculitic kidney damage.11 Hematuria, either microscopic or gross hematuria, is present in almost all the AGN patients and is closely associated with severity of the disease. Apart from the glomerular lesions, the severity of renal involvement in AAV could vary according to different serology of ANCA. In our previous study and other literature,12,13 patients with PR3-ANCAs presented with minor renal involvement in comparison with those positive to MPO-ANCAs. Patients with PR3-ANCAs could present with less proteinuria or lower serum creatinine levels. Contrary to the presentation of renal involvement, patients with PR3-ANCA positivity have a higher prevalence of extra-renal organ manifestations than do those with MPO-ANCA positivity.14 Moreover, the difference might be due to etiology of the disease and the pathogenesis of PR3/MPO ANCA.\nThe hallmark lesion in patients with AGN is the socalled pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis which often presents as necrotizing or crescentic glomerulonephritis without deposition of immunoglobulins. The pauci-immune condition is defined as less than 2 + immunofluorescence staining for immunoglobin (Ig) G, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q. Apart from the pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, immune complex deposition could also be found in the kidneys of some patients with AAV.15,16,17 Though it is not clear whether immune complex deposition in AAV could be due to the overlapped syndrome (AAV superimposed on immune complex-mediated glomerular lesions), it is clear that patients with immune complex might present with a higher level of proteinuria than do those without.删除4：<u>15</u>\nIn the acute phase of AAV, fibrinoid necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration could be present in the kidney. These could present in glomeruli as segmental necrosis and crescent formation which are the characteristics of AGN. With the progression of the disease, the acute lesions would then evolve into chronic sclerotic lesions with leukocyte infiltration. In this process, leukocytes and macrophages play important roles.\nMacrophages are myeloid immune cells that are positioned throughout the body tissues and have been demonstrated to be derived from circulating monocytes. Tissue macrophages can also be replenished by bone marrow-derived monocytes.18,19 Upon activation, macrophage could generate classically activated (M1) macrophages, which could promote tissue injury and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, which could promote tissue repair.18 Because of the bipolar mode of macrophage in maintaining homeostatic functions, macrophages have received much attention. In the study by Zhao et al,20 CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages were found to be predominated at sites of fibrinoid necrosis in AAV patients, exceeding the quantity of neutrophils and T cells. Furthermore, normal-appearing glomeruli had significantly more CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages than controls. The authors thus hypothesized that M2 macrophages might be precursor steps in the evolution of fibrinoid necrosis and subsequent crescents formation. In the study by O'Reilly et al,21 urinary soluble CD163 (sCD163) which was the biomarker of macrophage activation, was closely associated with active vasculitis. Furthermore, Rousselle et al22 found monocytes could promote crescent formation in a mice model of AAV. Those studies thus suggest macrophage/monocyte would be related to vasculitic kidney damage.\nIn literature,23,24 complement deposition was found to be associated with cellular crescents which suggested it might also play a role in crescent formation and kidney damage in AAV. During the development of segmental fibrinoid necrosis, interstitial monocytes and CD3+ T cells infiltrated and then contributed to further kidney damage. In the animal models of AAV, T cells were reported to be involved in the development of glomerular crescent.25 As there is some argument about the study because the glomerular lesions in an animal model were different from those in the human specimen, the mechanism of the crescent and fibrinoid necrosis formation is not clearly understood yet.\nLarge groups of studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of renal biopsy because specific renal pathological lesions are associated with renal outcome.26 Furthermore, renal biopsy specimens provide evidence to predict renal outcome as well as kidney function at disease onset.27,28 Given this background, a histopathologic classification was proposed to study the correlation between renal injury patterns and patients' prognosis.26 The classification consists of four categories-focal (≥50% of normal glomeruli), sclerotic (≥50% of globally sclerosed glomeruli), crescentic (≥50% of glomeruli with cellular crescents) and mixed (<50% normal, <50% crescentic, <50% globally sclerotic glomeruli) classes depending on the percent-age of globally sclerotic or crescentic glomeruli in the renal specimens. Since the proposal of the 2010 classification, many studies have been published to validate the application of 2010 classification in different populations, but the results were controversial. Therefore, combining the results by carrying out a meta-analysis might be useful to further validate the clinical application of the 2010 classification to predict the outcome of AAV patients.\nWe thus performed a meta-analysis13 combining data from 17 studies from Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Australia. In all, 1601 patients including 61 pediatric patients and 1540 adults were enrolled in our study. Our meta-analysis results showed that renal outcome was the best in focal class while worst in sclerotic class. However, renal outcome was not significantly different between mixed and crescentic classes. As the only meta-analysis in the literature discussing the application of 2010 histopathological classification in AAV patients,29 our study thus provides evidence that showed the prognostic value of proportion of normal and sclerotic glomeruli in determining the renal outcome of AAV patients. As sclerotic lesions usually represent chronic glomerular injuries in the kidney, sclerotic class is associated with worse renal outcome. It is known that crescent is one of the characteristics of AAV patients. Crescent usually represents active vasculitis lesion in AAV patients. However, our meta-analysis did not find significant difference regarding renal outcome between crescentic class and mixed class. Considering the percentage of normal and crescentic glomeruli in renal biopsy specimens constitutes the major differences between focal and crescentic class, our results thus pointed out that prognostic value of crescent might not be as useful as normal or sclerotic glomeruli. One possible explanation for this result is the different treatment responses of patients with active vasculitis to standard treatment. Though there is some argument supporting the combining of these two classes29,30 and some studies already did so while validating the 2010 classification,29,31 we suggested stratifying patients with those histopathological classes in large study cohort would be useful.\nTubulointerstitial injury is an important factor that affects renal outcome in patients with glomerulonephritis. However, tubulointerstitial parameters were not included in the 2010 classification due to avoidance of statistical complexity. The absence of tubulointerstitial injury in the classification does not mean it is not important because in our study, in which 186 AAV patients were diagnosed in our center,13 we found the focal class had the mildest and the sclerotic class the most severe tubulointerstitial injury. Therefore, tubulointerstitial injury might affect renal outcome, but further studies taking into account tubulointerstitial lesion as well as glomerular lesions might be necessary.\nIt has been seven years since the initial proposal of 2010 histopathological classification in AAV. Though certain limitation exists in its application in clinical practice, our meta-analysis confirmed its prognostic value to predict renal outcome in those patients. Further studies aiming to modify the classification and provide the realistic prognosis of the patients with AAV might be necessary. We encourage more studies using the 2010 classification to assess different treatment responses to provide optimistic management of this disorder and tailored treatment accordingly.\nAGN treatment was mostly the same as AAV treatment. Briefly, treatment can be divided into two phases—induction of remission and maintenance therapy. Induction therapy commonly comprises high-dose glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide or methotrexate. However, if the patient experiences life-threatening organ involvement like pulmonary hemorrhage, plasma exchange or high-dosage methylprednisolone would be beneficial.32 Plasma exchange has been shown to have a therapeutic effect in patients with AAV who have severe renal impairment (serum creatinine >6 mg/dl or requiring dialysis), and those with alveolar hemorrhage.33 Maintenance therapy usually requires long-term immunosuppressant for at least 18-24 months after successfully finishing induction therapy,8 and recent studies showed prolonged remission maintenance therapy would provide some evidence for reducing relapses.34,35 Azathioprine or methotrexate and low-dose glucocorticoids are currently the standard treatment of maintenance therapy. Other immunosuppressants such as leflunomide or mycophenolate mofetil prove useful in a small group of patients and are suggested as the second-line treatment of the disease.\nBiological therapies are new approaches to treat patients with AGN. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody is one of the new alternative methods to treat patients with renal diseases. By depleting circulating and tissue-resident CD20 cells, rituximab has been increasingly used off-label in various auto-immune diseases including AGN and various studies have published showing the efficacy of rituximab in treating patients with the disease. Specks et al36 demonstrated in their study that a single course of rituximab was as effective as conventional immuno-suppressants for remission induction therapy. Further-more, many other studies reported a high rate of improvement by rituximab in treating patients with GPA and EGPA.37,38 Moreover, rituximab was shown to be superior to traditional immunosup-pressant—azathioprine for remission therapy.39 However, the results of rituximab treatment were not unanimous. The RAVE study marked a watershed in the therapy of rituximab because the study showed the rituximab was not superior to cyclophosphamide in patients with severe AAV but might be superior in relapsing diseases.40 As a novel therapeutic strategy in AGN, rituximab was also associated with many side effects including hypogammaglobulinemia, infusion reactions, hepatitis B reactivation, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and others.41 More studies are necessary to investigate the therapeutic effects and safety of rituximab in treating patients with the disease.\nApart from rituximab, Avacopan—a C5a receptor inhibitor was found to be effective in treating patients with AAV.42 Other agents like tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockade (infliximab) and soluble TNF receptor antagonist (etanercept) are still being studied to investigate their efficacy or safety in AAV patients.\nIt has been more than 20 years since we first discovered ANCA and then proved its pathogenesis. Tremendous advances have been made in understanding the nature of AAV. Though lots of work has been done to investigate the mechanism of the disease, and improve therapeutic strategy and disease management, much remains unclear in this field, and the prognosis of the disease is unsatisfactory. Further work is required to optimize better prognosis and disease management.\n\"The road ahead afar, and I will search long and far.\"  On the road of optimized management of AAV, we are heading in the right direction.\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\nThis study is supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation 通用删除7(英):<u>(81470041, 81000285, 81470967, 81600590)</u>, Special Fund for Public Welfare Projects of National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People’s Republic of China (OUMP2014-002); Health and Family Planning Commission of Shanghai municipality (20154Y0015); and grants from the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (12DJ1400303, 11JC1407901, 15401970303, 15441903505, 16DZ1930502).\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2018.05.004</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Further integrating HIV care for mothers and infants by providing combined interventions from the continuum of health and social services (e.g. adherence support, assisted disclosure of HIV status) as well as engaging the community in the delivery of health services (e.g. mentor mothers) can increase coverage, engagement in care, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability 通用删除6(英):<u>[27, 28]</u>.\nEvidence of success of EID interventions identifying infants with HIV, improving linkage to care, demonstrating operational feasibility, and improving overall patient outcomes is accumulating 通用删除6(英):<u>[13, 14, 15, 17, 29]</u>. However, limited evidence on the economic implications of these interventions is available. To inform decisions about EID program design and implementation, costs and cost-effectiveness estimates of EID are needed, particularly for high HIV burden, resource-poor settings. In this scoping review, we systematically summarize the available literature on the costs and cost-effectiveness of EID in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also discuss practical implications and key limitations of existing studies.\nWe conducted a scoping review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> as well as general related guidance 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. A study protocol was made publicly available on the Open Science Framework on June 8, 2021 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. In line with PRISMA-ScR recommendations, we did not perform a quality appraisal of the included studies.\nWe searched the bibliographic databases Embase and MEDLINE (via Ovid) and EconLit (via EBSCOhost) for eligible pre-print and peer-reviewed records published in English between January 1, 2008 and June 8, 2021. We restricted our search to records published since 2008 based on 2008 WHO guidance recommending all HIV-exposed infants be tested by 2 months of age followed by immediate ART initiation for infants with HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. We also searched the archives of major HIV conferences (International AIDS Society conferences including AIDS and the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections) and Google Scholar (stopping screening after 50 irrelevant hits). The search strategy was based on four search terms clusters: HIV, infants, EID, and costs/cost-effectiveness 通用删除1(英):<u></u>.\nWe included studies of HIV-exposed infants in LMICs (defined by the World Bank classification 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>) exposed to interventions/programs aimed at improving access to EID and/or completion of the EID cascade 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> and reporting costs or cost-effectiveness outcomes. The EID cascade was defined as 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> identification of the HIV-exposed infant (known HIV exposure or symptomatic infant), 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> HIV testing, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> communication of results, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> linkage to care, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> ART initiation. If applicable, relevant comparators were alternative interventions or the local standard-of-care. We excluded commentaries, correspondence articles, and reviews, but screened the references of reviews to identify additional original articles for inclusion.\nOur primary extracted outcomes were reported costs, cost savings, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net health or monetary benefit, as defined by Drummond et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. Secondary outcomes related to health or the EID care process (e.g. turnaround time, proportions of infants initiating treatment) were extracted as alternative disease-specific effects to enrich our discussion of the economic evidence for EID within the context of LMIC infant populations where health utilities are typically unavailable. For articles that did not report the reference year for costs, we assumed it to be 2 years prior to publication. All costs were converted to 2021 USD using the International Monetary Fund Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annual deflator for the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>.\nThree review authors (KE, KEF, BPG) screened titles and abstracts of retrieved records after the removal of duplicates using Covidence 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. Full-text review was conducted by KE, AE, and VO. Two review authors (AE and VO) extracted outcome data from the included studies to Microsoft Excel 16.60 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA), and a third review author (KE) cross-checked the data. Discrepancies were discussed among the authors and resolved by consensus. Extracted data were summarized in narrative and tabular formats. Descriptive statistics including frequencies and percentages and ranges of costs for comparable tests were compiled.\nWe identified 1786 studies including 1011 studies from database searches and 775 studies from the references of reviews. After removing 508 duplicates, we screened titles and abstracts of 1278 studies and reviewed the full text of 99 studies. We included 29 studies on the costs and cost-effectiveness of EID. Reasons for exclusion were lack of cost data (51%), article type (e.g. review or opinion article) (17%), unavailability of abstract (10%) or abstract for which the full results were later published (7.1%), interventions not related to EID (7.1%), population not HIV-exposed infants (5.7%), or study setting outside of LMICs (1.4%) .\nAmong the included studies, there were 12 model-based cost-effectiveness analyses (11 full texts and one abstract) and 17 cost analyses (14 full texts and three abstracts) published between 2008 and 2021 通用删除1(英):<u></u>. All studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa except for one study from Thailand 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. Nine cost analyses included primary cost data collection 通用删除6(英):<u>[39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]</u>. Cost estimates for other studies were derived from programmatic data, published estimates (e.g. Clinton Health Access Initiative, Global Fund 通用删除6(英):<u>[48, 49]</u>), or the literature. Effectiveness data used in cost-effectiveness analyses were collected from Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS pooled analyses, WHO and UNICEF estimates, programmatic data, and the literature.\nWe categorized EID tests into four groups: PoC-nucleic acid testing (NAT; e.g. Abbott m-PIMA, Cepheid GeneXpert®), laboratory-based NAT, rapid antigen- or antibody-based tests, and unspecified NAT. Currently, only NAT are recommended for EID 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Unit costs per test are reported in Table 1. Seven studies reported unit costs for PoC assays 通用删除6(英):<u>[13, 40, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]</u>, 13 for laboratory testing 通用删除6(英):<u>[13, 24, 38, 39, 41, 44, 46, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]</u>, two for rapid testing 通用删除6(英):<u>[41, 56]</u>, and one for unspecified NAT 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>. All unit costs are expressed in 2021 USD unless otherwise specified. Reported PoC-NAT cost per test were 21.46-51.80 USD. Costs for commercially available laboratory-based NAT were 16.21-42.73 USD.\nUnit cost per test for HIV early infant diagnosis\n删除重复语句：<u>Unit cost per test for HIV early infant diagnosis</u>\nUSD United States dollar, PoC point-of-care, CHAI Clinton Health Access Initiative, EID early infant diagnosis, rtPCR reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, DBS dried blood sample, NAT nucleic acid testing\na Consolidated cost for testing cartridges inclusive of equipment, maintenance, data, and connectivity, assuming 1300 tests/platform/year and including VL assays, over 3 years\nb Incorporates utilization (i.e. the ability of the machine to run additional assays including HIV viral load for mPIMA and HIV viral load and tuberculosis for GeneXpert®)\nc Range dependent on infant age and symptoms. Cost includes RHT+ confirmatory DNA-PCR if RHT is positive. Rapid RHT activity cost is 0.88 USD\nVariation in unit costs for PoC assays may be explained by inclusion of capital costs. Costs for m-PIMA that included equipment costs were > 20 USD higher than those that did not include equipment costs. GeneXpert® costs per test were less sensitive to variation due to inclusion of equipment costs, with studies excluding equipment costs reporting 21.46-26.20 USD and those including equipment costs reporting 29.96-33.74 USD . This may be due to the incorporation of utilization, including the ability to run multiple tests simultaneously, in the unit cost. m-PIMA can run one test at a time, whereas GeneXpert® analyzers support two or four tests run simultaneously. However, utilization is only relevant when equipment costs are included and only one study including equipment costs from Zimbabwe specified that they considered utilization 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. The types of services that were included in the unit costs for centralized laboratory testing were more varied and less commonly detailed.\nOne study, conducted in Zambia, evaluated PoC p24 assays which may be more affordable than PoC-NAT tests (< 15 USD per test) and do not require specialized equipment 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u>. Despite low sensitivity in very young infants, PoC p24 assays could play a role in diagnosing infants > 4 weeks of age at rural sites where the significant capital investment in PoC-NAT testing platforms is not feasible 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u>. An assay that is 80% sensitive and links 99% of positive infants to care achieves the same level of ART coverage as an assay that is 95% sensitive and only links 85% of positive infants to care 通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>. However, PoC p24 assays are currently not approved.\nA study from Uganda reported that rapid antibody screening before EID testing of infants with a positive serology result was a cost-saving measure at 10-30 USD per test 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. This is no longer recommended in the context of declining MTCT rates as well as wider availability of NAT and inferior sensitivity of antibody tests compared to NAT 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\nAmong 24 studies reporting costs of an EID intervention or program, these were reported as lifetime cost per HIV-exposed infant, average cost per HIV-positive diagnosis, cost per HIV-exposed infant person-year, or total price of the intervention/program . Few studies assessed the same intervention or reported costs in the same way, making comparison of costs across studies challenging. Most studies evaluated costs or cost-effectiveness of EID testing approaches including four studies on PoC EID 通用删除6(英):<u>[45, 50, 52, 53]</u>, three on birth testing 通用删除6(英):<u>[24, 44, 59]</u>, one study that assessed both PoC and improvements to centralized EID 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>, one that reported costs of confirmatory testing in EID programs 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>, one of added screening of mothers at 6-week infant immunization visits with referral to EID for infants at risk of acquiring HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>, and one of rapid antibody screening to rule out negative infants before NAT 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>.\nCosts of early infant HIV diagnosis interventions and programs\n删除重复语句：<u>Costs of early infant HIV diagnosis interventions and programs</u>\nUSD United States dollar, PoC point-of-care, EID early infant diagnosis, rtPCR reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, DBS dried blood sample, NAT nucleic acid test, MCH maternal and child health, PPY per person-year\na Assuming 66.3% of infants whose mothers are accessing PMTCT services are tested\nLifetime PoC EID testing costs were estimated at 264 and 470 USD per infant in Zimbabwe 通用删除6(英):<u>[51, 52]</u> and 1.2-4.7 million USD total program costs 通用删除6(英):<u>[50, 53]</u> in representative sub-Saharan African countries. Modelled total PoC EID program costs were slightly higher for m-PIMA compared to GeneXpert® but similar for settings with low and high PMTCT coverage 通用删除6(英):<u>[50, 53]</u>. While unit costs for PoC EID are generally higher than laboratory-based testing, PoC testing addresses well-recognized challenges of conventional laboratory-based EID including improving turnaround times, increasing the proportion of infants with HIV initiating ART, and leading to earlier ART initiation 通用删除6(英):<u>[13, 15, 17, 29]</u>. As initial investment in PoC-NAT platforms and infrastructure to support decentralized testing is significant 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>, costs are highly impacted by throughput. Average throughput across eight sub-Saharan African countries in a 2019 study was 0.7-3 tests/day/health facility with an associated additional cost of 10 USD/test compared with optimal throughput (defined as 70% of platform capacity) in the same setting 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Integrating capital costs across programs (e.g. HIV viral load and tuberculosis testing) and/or health facilities via hub-and-spoke models and thereby increasing throughput can reduce costs 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>. Similarly, personnel sharing across services may increase efficiency without lowering the quality of services 通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u>.\nThe discounted cost of birth testing from a modelling study in South Africa was 1012 USD per HIV-exposed infant with an in-utero infection rate of 1.8% 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. The incremental cost of testing infants exposed to HIV at birth in Lesotho was 9114 USD per infant identified as infected at birth with an in-utero infection rate of 0.5%. This decreased to 2289 USD with an in-utero infection rate of 2%, similar to the undiscounted cost of 2140 USD per infant in the previous study. In countries with low coverage of PMTCT programs and higher in-utero infection rates (e.g. Nigeria 通用删除6(英):<u>[1, 2]</u>) birth testing may be cost-effective compared to birth plus 6-week testing 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. Targeted testing at birth only for infants at elevated risk of HIV acquisition (e.g. mother started ART late in pregnancy or has a high viral load around the time of delivery) reduces the burden on an already strained health workforce and therefore may be more appropriate for settings with low in-utero transmission rates 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>.\nStudies of other service delivery interventions, including co-located post-partum maternal and child health services in South Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>, sample transport in Uganda and Nigeria 通用删除6(英):<u>[22, 60]</u>, consolidation of EID testing in a single lab in Uganda 通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u>, electronic communication systems in Uganda, Mozambique, and Kenya 通用删除6(英):<u>[20, 23, 62, 63]</u>, and a quality assurance system modelled in five sub-Saharan African countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>, were also identified . One study reported costs of immediate versus delayed ART initiation following EID testing in Thailand 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. Three studies focused on cost variations across region or type of health facility within existing programs 通用删除6(英):<u>[42, 46, 47]</u>. These studies reported wide variation of cost estimates across settings and therefore recommended context-specific cost estimates to inform budgeting and planning 通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u>.\nTable 3 summarizes the results of the 12 cost-effectiveness analyses. All studies stated at least one of the interventions evaluated to be cost-effective or cost-saving. ICERs were expressed as incremental costs per year-of-life saved (YLS)/per life-years gained (LYG), per death averted, or per additional infant initiating ART within 60 days. One study modelled costs and effects separately and did not report an ICER 通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> and one study only reported an ICER for mother-infant pairs 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>, and these were not included in the table, however costs were included in Table 1 and Table 2.\nCost-effectiveness analysis of HIV early infant diagnosis results of included studies\n删除重复语句：<u>Cost-effectiveness analysis of HIV early infant diagnosis results of included studies</u>\nICER incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; NAT nucleic acid testing, EID early infant diagnosis of HIV, YLS years of life saved, USD United States dollar, GDP gross domestic product, PoC point-of-care, SoC standard-of-care, PMTCT prevention of mother-to-child-transmission of HIV, rtPCR reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, DBS dried blood sample, LYG life-years gained\nIncluded studies used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications Pediatric model 通用删除6(英):<u>[24, 27, 51, 54, 57, 64]</u> (i.e. a validated state transition model simulating individual costs and HIV disease outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[65, 66]</u>), decision tree models 通用删除6(英):<u>[41, 43, 53, 59]</u>, and cohort state transition simulation models 通用删除6(英):<u>[38, 50]</u>. Seven studies used a lifetime horizon for the model 通用删除6(英):<u>[24, 27, 38, 51, 52, 54, 57]</u>, while the remaining used time horizons of 5 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u>, 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>, 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>, and 18 months 通用删除6(英):<u>[41, 50]</u>. Nine studies used a discount rate of 3% per year for both costs and health benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>[24, 27, 38, 41, 43, 51, 52, 54, 57]</u>, two studies reported only undiscounted costs and benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>[50, 53]</u>, and one study, an abstract, did not specify whether discounting was applied 通用删除6(英):<u>[59, 67]</u>.\nOut of four cost-effectiveness studies comparing PoC-NAT to centralized testing, only two reported a willingness-to-pay threshold. Willingness-to-pay thresholds are vital for decision-makers to be able to assess whether resource allocation for an intervention is worth the investment and are often oriented at the country-specific per-capita GDP, particularly in LMIC settings (WHO CHOICE). ICERs per YLS for PoC EID were 52% 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> and 67% 通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> of the country-specific (Zimbabwe) per-capita GDP. ICERs for studies that did not report a willingness-to-pay threshold ranged from 23 to 1554 USD per additional child initiating ART within 60 days and 90-5976 per death averted (2018 USD) and were lower for GeneXpert® compared to m-PIMA 通用删除6(英):<u>[50, 53]</u>. Several models assumed 100% EID uptake 通用删除6(英):<u>[51, 52]</u> which excludes the potential costs and benefits of improving access to EID. This assumption favors PoC testing because it is more likely to increase access to EID compared to laboratory-based programs.\nWhile decentralized testing increases access and linkage to ART, it often comes with increased challenges of supply chain management and maintenance. A system-level quality assurance system added to PoC EID programs and aimed at reducing screening interruptions and the misdiagnosis rate was found to be cost-saving in four of five countries modelled 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>. The modelled quality assurance system included external proficiency testing, reports, and corrective action including supervisory visits, equipment maintenance, and refresher trainings. Quality assurance systems can easily be extended to other PoC testing applications and may improve the overall level of service at primary health facilities.\nConfirmatory testing was also demonstrated to be cost-saving in South Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>, and two cost-effectiveness analyses of PoC testing included scenarios with PoC and laboratory-based confirmatory testing 通用删除6(英):<u>[50, 53]</u>. Without confirmatory testing, more than 10% of infants initiating ART may not actually be HIV-infected in settings with similar MTCT rates to South Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>. ICERs for confirmatory testing at the PoC versus laboratory were slightly more favorable 通用删除6(英):<u>[50, 53]</u>, and the WHO now supports PoC testing to confirm positive results 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\nTwo cost-effectiveness studies comparing birth plus 6-week testing to 6-week testing only, conducted in South Africa and Lesotho, concluded that cost-effectiveness of birth plus 6-week testing was dependent on prompt ART initiation and the degree to which ART reduces mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[24, 44]</u>. Birth plus 6-week testing exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold of 50% of per-capita GDP in South Africa when the added cost was > 7 USD or NAT costs exceeded ~ 36 (2021 USD) 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Several estimates included in this review of both PoC and laboratory-based NAT costs in real-world settings exceeded this value 通用删除6(英):<u>[13, 40, 44, 53]</u>.\nTracking of infants testing negative at birth to ensure they complete 6-week testing is crucial to detect intra-partum and early breastfeeding transmission. With loss to follow-up rates > 37% between birth and 6-week testing, 1-year survival for infants with HIV in South Africa was lower compared to testing only at 6 weeks of age 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Thus, targeted birth testing of infants at high risk of HIV acquisition may be more appropriate given the significant resource investment in testing and tracking of infants to ensure they complete follow-up testing and are linked to care.\nICERs for HIV exposure screening and referral to EID at infant immunization visits compared to standard 6-week NAT ranged from 10 to 78% of country-specific per-capita GDP in three sub-Saharan African countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>. Initial rapid HIV testing to screen out uninfected infants before NAT was stated to be cost-effective in Uganda, however, a willingness-to-pay threshold was not specified 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. The latter is no longer recommended in the context of declining MTCT rates and inferior sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests compared to NAT, as well as the wider availability and similar cost of PoC-NAT for EID. Rapid diagnostic tests for HIV serology are recommended for diagnosing HIV in children > 18 months 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\nSeveral gaps in the literature on the cost-effectiveness of EID were identified here. Compared with effectiveness studies, sources of heterogeneity across economic evaluations are more numerous, limiting generalizability of cost-effectiveness results 通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u>. Cost-effectiveness analyses in this scoping review most commonly compared costs and health benefits of an intervention with current best practice or standard-of-care. Comparison of results across studies is complicated by the fact that standard-of-care is typically not well defined, differs greatly across settings, and is changing rapidly in many countries. Future cost-effectiveness studies will need to carefully consider further changes to these standard-of-care comparisons to accurately guide decision-making.\nLack of data availability in resource-poor settings, both for costs and long-term outcomes of children living with HIV, means model parameters are informed by few estimates from the literature, and it is often necessary to combine data from multiple sources . Cost-effectiveness analyses included in this review made efforts to use the best available data at the time of the study and used sensitivity analyses to compensate for uncertainty, however, the resulting long-term model predictions are still subject to considerable uncertainty. Considering that resource use and opportunity costs are highly context-dependent, decision-makers should focus on the most applicable studies to their settings to effectively distribute resources rather than attempting to synthesize less applicable results from multiple studies. Where generalizable results are unavailable, conducting further economic evaluations could be considered, incorporating local data on costs and where possible, outcomes of children with HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u>.\nIntervention scenarios discussed here generally assume that existing human resources would be sufficient to cover scale-up of EID interventions including task-shifting testing from laboratories to health facilities with PoC EID. This assumption may be unrealistic in settings where uptake of EID is expected to increase. Future economic analyses could include health system constraints by limiting the feasible coverage of interventions to align with current capacity or account for increased human resource costs related to expanding services.\nIn the absence of available data, the cost-effectiveness modelling of EID presented here does not incorporate additional activities designed to increase uptake, retention in care, and adherence to treatment. This may include traditional service delivery in healthcare settings as well as community health workers and/or mentor mothers. As a result, there remains a limited understanding of the impact of a comprehensive package of services for EID. With many countries moving towards widespread PoC EID, there is an opportunity for economic evaluations to inform priority setting and support the design of optimal service delivery models, but empirical cost data is needed. Evaluations of EID interventions and programs could therefore consider including data collection of real-world implementation costs. Further, full costs of program delivery including outreach should be represented.\nLastly, there were no studies evaluating the costs or cost-effectiveness of routinely offered facility-based testing. As EID is mostly delivered as part of PMTCT services, infants born to mothers receiving inadequate or no PMTCT interventions who are at higher risk of vertical HIV acquisition are also the most likely not to receive a diagnostic test within the first 2 months of life. In settings with high maternal HIV prevalence and poor PMTCT coverage, facility-based testing of infants with unknown HIV status in a range of clinical settings can help close the gap in EID coverage. The yield of positive test results was found to be high for inpatient care and malnutrition clinics in a systematic review of EID testing outside of PMTCT services 通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u>. More data on the costs and cost-effectiveness of testing infants in specific healthcare settings as a strategy to reduce HIV-related mortality are needed.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first review to broadly describe the economic evidence on multiple EID interventions and/or programs. We conducted a broad search of the literature including peer-reviewed and grey literature and extracted extensive information to summarize EID unit costs, intervention costs and cost-effectiveness findings. We also converted findings to a common currency to increase comparability. Limitations of our study include restricting our search to studies published since the 2008 WHO recommendation to test HIV-exposed infants for HIV by 2 months of age, which is, however, the period in which major developments in EID started. Additionally, while we used a broad coverage GDP deflator rather than a consumer price index, it is unclear how the relevant costs in the respective settings have changed since the studies were conducted. Comparison of economic evidence across studies was limited due to heterogeneity of studies in interventions and comparators evaluated, the scope of costs included, as well as assumptions made in terms of model design. Finally, we did not systematically assess the quality of the included studies and potential resulting biases, as is common for scoping reviews.\nThe available cost and cost-effectiveness evidence for EID of HIV covers a broad range of interventions and suggests most EID interventions are indeed cost-effective. Few studies reported cost or cost-effectiveness estimates for the same intervention in comparable settings, and resources included in the cost estimates vary widely. Thus, comparison of costs across studies is challenging. Relatively few studies included primary cost data collection, and several report a lack of context- and setting-specific cost data as a limitation. Similarly, cost-effectiveness modelling studies must make assumptions based on limited data both for costs and outcomes of children exposed to HIV.\nIncreasing uptake and coverage of EID will likely be achieved through a package of services supporting EID service delivery and engagement in care. The scope of studies in this review did not cover the additional costs and benefits outside of EID programs that such comprehensive service delivery would provide. Future cost and cost-effectiveness studies capturing costs and benefits of EID services as they are delivered in real-world settings are needed to support the needs of decision-makers.\nTable S1.

The most common and devastating complications of diabetes occur in the cardiovascular system.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Adults with diabetes have a two- to three-fold increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Endothelial dysfunction is one of the earliest detectable pathological events during the early-onset period of diabetes in humans.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Clinical trials with large sample sizes found that the hyperglycemia characteristic of diabetes is the most important causative factor for endothelial dysfunction and accelerated CVD in individuals with diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> The landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial found that intensive control of blood glucose effectively reduces the risk of development of complications in individuals with type 1 diabetes. These benefits remain despite less intensive blood sugar control by many patients years after the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial study ended.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>\nAdenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a three-subunit (α, β, γ) enzyme ubiquitously distributed throughout the mammalian cardiovascular system, including endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,11,12]</u> AMPK is a sensor of cellular energy status (energy sensor) and a major regulator of energy metabolism.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,11,12]</u> We and others found that AMPK has a broad range of functions in the cardiovascular system. Our research group was the first to report that AMPK is activated by low levels of free radicals and oxidants (redox sensor); in return, oxidant-mediated AMPK activation effectively suppresses oxidant production (redox modulator).通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> Metformin, a potent AMPK activator, activates AMPK in a redox-sensitive manner. AMPK activation effectively prevents endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis-related CVD in mice and human patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> In this mini-review, we will summarize the roles and etiology of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. We will then present evidence to support the hypothesis that AMPK is a redox sensor and modulator, and AMPK dysfunction plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of endothelial dysfunction in patients with diabetes.\nCardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes are the most common and devastating manifestations of the disease and are the major cause of hospital admissions.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> Accelerated atherosclerosis is one striking feature of these complications and is associated with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18,19,20,21,22,23]</u> Endothelial cells have crucial roles in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. They are a physical barrier between the lumen and vessel wall and secrete molecules that regulate coagulation, platelet aggregation, vascular tone, and fibrinolysis.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by reduced bioavailability of vasodilators (mainly NO) and/or increased numbers and concentrations of endothelium-derived contracting factors.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> This imbalance impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation and the impairment manifests as the functional characteristics of endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction also includes endothelial activation, which is characterized by a proliferative, proinflammatory, and procoagulatory state that supports the entire progression of atherogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u> Endothelial dysfunction occurs early ahead of structural vessel wall changes detected using angiography or ultrasound.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Endothelial dysfunction is a consistent finding in patients with diabetes; it manifests as impairment of NO production and activity,通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> and endothelial dysfunction is a driving force during the development and progression of cardiovascular complications in diabetes. Indeed, targeting endothelial injury may be an effective approach for the management of diabetes-associated vascular disorders and therapeutic interventions aimed at improving endothelial function in patients with diabetes have been tested in clinical trials.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>\nDiabetes Control and Complications Trial and United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study findings revealed the efficacy of intensive glucose control for reducing the risk of diabetes-associated microvascular complications (eg, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy).通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u> Findings of Diabetes Control and Complications Trial from long-term follow-up of participants found a decreased incidence in atherosclerosis in those with intensively-controlled blood glucose concentrations.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> This result suggests that hyperglycemia is important in the development of macrovascular diseases in patients with diabetes. There is an abnormality in endothelium-dependent relaxation in individuals in whom blood glucose and insulin levels are acutely increased using glucose infusion.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,32]</u> Multiple pathways can be involved with the dysfunction and activation of endothelial cells induced by hyperglycemia, including enhanced glycolysis, the formation of glycolysis intermediates, and advanced glycation end (AGE) product modifications.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\nHyperglycemia is just one of many metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes. Another contributing factor for endothelial dysfunction in diabetes is the elevation of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs).通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33,34]</u> Impaired glucose tolerance can occur in young normoglycemic relatives of patients with high FFAs.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,32,33,34]</u> An increase in FFAs is an important feature of diabetes and is common in type 1 and type 2 forms of the disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,35]</u> High levels of plasma FFAs caused by infusing a lipid emulsion and heparin impairs endothelium-mediated vasodilatation (and NO production) in human volunteers undergoing the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique.通用删除6(英):<u>[36,37]</u> Patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes have elevated plasma FFA levels, which play detrimental roles in the etiology of atherosclerosis and CVD. FFA-driven endothelial dysfunction occurs through mechanisms including impairment of insulin signaling and reduction of NO, inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial cell apoptosis, and activation of the reninangiotensin system. Targeting signaling pathways involving FFA-induced endothelial dysfunction can be used to prevent endothelial dysfunction and subsequent complications, such as atherosclerosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>\nInsulin resistance plays a pathophysiological role in type 2 diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[39,40]</u> Insulin regulates glucose homeostasis by promoting glucose disposal in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, inhibiting gluconeogenesis in the liver,通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> and regulating the transport of nutrients to target tissues via actions on the microvasculature.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> Insulin-induced NO production from the vascular endothelium leads to increased blood flow that further enhances glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> Insulin resistance is frequently associated with endothelial dysfunction and has been proposed to have a major role in CVD. The balance between the NO-dependent vasodilator actions and endothelin-1-dependent vasoconstrictor actions of insulin is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling in vascular endothelium. During insulin-resistant conditions, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling impairment can cause an imbalance between the production of NO and the secretion of endothelin-1 and lead to endothelial dysfunction.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>\nMetabolic conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (insulin resistance) are associated with inflammation. Adipocytes can constitutively express tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> Expression of this important proinflammatory cytokine is markedly increased in animal models of obesity.通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> Using soluble TNF-α receptors to neutralize TNF-α receptors can reduce insulin resistance in these animal models.通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> These findings first linked the increased expression of a proinflammatory cytokine to insulin resistance.通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> The results of studies in humans support these findings. Diabetes and obesity (the main risk factor for type 2 diabetes) are inflammatory diseases, as indicated by elevated plasma concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,44,45]</u> Experimental and clinical investigations found that vascular inflammation has an important role in the progression of endothelial dysfunction. In endothelial dysfunction, the endothelium loses its physiological properties, reduces the bioavailability of NO, and changes to a state of vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and inflammation. Inflammation is essential for the development of vascular complications in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> Anti-inflammatory adiponectin can protect endothelial function, and interventions to reduce inflammation (eg, administration of salicylate) can prevent vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular events.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>\nHyperglycemia is the fundamental abnormality in diabetes and is associated with oxidative stress.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> Hyperglycemia perpetuates oxidative stress by releasing O2⋅- from multiple sources from endothelial cells 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. Although O2⋅- has been previously recognized as an important cytotoxic factor contributing to tissue damage, O2⋅- alone does not exhibit high reactivity towards most types of biological molecules. O2⋅- can be highly reactive after its reaction of NO to yield a potent oxidizing species ONOO- by a direct bimolecular reaction of NO with O2⋅- at near diffusion-limited rates (6.7 × 109.mol-1.s-1) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. This rate constant of NO with O2⋅- is 3 times faster than the enzymatic dismutation of O2⋅- catalyzed by superoxide dismutase (SOD) at neutral pH (Ksod=2×109.mol-1.s-1). Thus, depending upon local rates of production of both NO and O2⋅-, ONOO- formation represents a major potential pathway of NO reactivity.\nOverwhelming evidence supports a causative role of oxidative stress in the development and progression of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. In patients with diabetes, increased plasma levels of ROS markers like thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, 8 alpha-isoprostanes, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), protein oxidation products,通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine, and 8-oxoguanosine通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u> have been found along with decreased antioxidant defenses (eg, total antioxidant capacity,通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> bilirubin, SOD, and antioxidant vitamins通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>). The sources of oxidative stress in diabetes include non-enzymatic, enzymatic, and mitochondrial pathways.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> The non-enzymatic mechanisms include generation of hydroxy (OH) via autooxidation of glucose and formation of AGEs.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> Enhanced metabolism of glucose via the polyol pathway produces O2⋅-; stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system in diabetes also promotes ROS formation.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> The enzymatic sources of ROS generation in diabetes include NOS, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX), and xanthine oxidase.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> Xanthine oxidase mediates the final 2 reactions of the purine metabolism pathway and generates significant amounts of ROS.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> The O2⋅- and other ROS produced can then stimulate signaling pathways associated with cell growth and the inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis that eventually lead to the development of the complications of diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[55,56]</u>\nWith respect to oxygen-derived free radicals and oxidants, study results indicate that oxidative stress has a vital role in the pathogenesis of complications associated with diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[57,58]</u> Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress may be the earliest event associated with progression of inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> Although insulin resistance has been attributed to the inflammatory processes starting in adipose tissue, study results suggest that endothelial dysfunction represents the upstream event that precedes peripheral impairment of insulin sensitivity. Suppression of ROS-dependent pathways in the endothelium restores insulin delivery to peripheral organs by preserving NO availability.通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u> Such a disruptive effect of ROS in diabetes is supported by the comparable endothelial dysfunction in vitamin E-deprived rats.通用删除6(英):<u>[61,62]</u> Similarly, defective endothelium-dependent vasodilation in subjects with type 2 diabetes通用删除6(英):<u>[33,63,64]</u> can be reversed using dietary ascorbic acid.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> This effect of ascorbic acid also occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[66,67]</u> As detailed below, several enzymatic systems in diabetic endothelial cells are activated to become a main source of O2⋅-.\nPNOX is a membrane-associated, heme-containing enzyme complex consisting of 7 subunits and is a major source of O2⋅- production in diabetes. Vascular NOX consists of multiple subunits, including p22phox, p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, Nox organizer 1 (NoxO1), Nox activator 1 (NoxA1), Rac1, and unique NOX isoforms (based on gp91phox).通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> NOX isoforms are catalytic subunits for ROS generation. They are differentially expressed and regulated in various cell types and pathological conditions but remain to be fully characterized. Seven homologues of the NOX family have been identified: Nox1-5, DUOX1, and DUOX2.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> Endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells predominantly express Nox2, Nox4, and Nox1 isoforms.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u>\nActivation of NOX is implicated in oxidative stress associated with hyperglycemia. Protein kinase C beta-dependent NOX activation has been suggested as the major source of oxidants in diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[70]</u> Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with high glucose increases NOX expression, apoptosis, and levels of oxidative stress markers.通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u> ROS production and expression of p22phox increase in mouse microvascular endothelial cells treated with high glucose.通用删除6(英):<u>[72]</u> A human clinical study found that NOX expression and activity was augmented in the metabolic syndrome group compared with the cardiovascular risk factor and control groups.通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u> Oxidized LDL and 3-nitrotyrosine levels and carotid intima-media thickness increased in the metabolic syndrome group compared with the cardiovascular risk factor and control groups; these changes were related to the NOX oxidase activity in the overall population.通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u> These findings suggest that abnormal activation of NOX is involved in oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nNOX-dependent superoxide production links palmitate-stimulated toll-like receptor 4 activations to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u> FFA-induced NOX subunit overexpression and ROS production could be involved in the endothelial dysfunction in obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Study results suggest that pitavastatin or NOX inhibitors protect against the effects of these changes.通用删除6(英):<u>[76]</u> Higher levels of superoxide in insulin-resistant endothelial cells can be pharmacologically inhibited (both acutely and chronically) using the NOX inhibitor, gp91ds-tat. Similarly, insulin resistance-induced impairment of endothelial-mediated vasorelaxation can be reversed using gp91ds-tat. Knockdown of Nox2, which is specifically elevated in insulin-resistant endothelial cells, can significantly reduce superoxide levels. Double transgenic mice with endothelial-specific insulin resistance and deletion of Nox2 have reduced superoxide production and improved vascular function. This study identified Nox2 as the central molecule in insulin resistance-mediated oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction.通用删除6(英):<u>[77]</u> It also established pharmacological inhibition of Nox2 as a novel therapeutic target in insulin resistance-related vascular disease.\nThe electron transport chain can generate ROS under physiological and pathological conditions. In diabetes, persistent hyperglycemia elevates FFA levels. FFAs are metabolized to produce increased levels of reduced coenzymes (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide). These reduced coenzymes enter the respiratory chain, and consequently, increase the production of O2⋅- to combat the flux of electrons.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> In diabetes, this mitochondrial O2⋅- stimulates the production of more ROS and reactive nitrogen species via activation of NF-κB-mediated cytokines, protein kinase C, and NOX.通用删除6(英):<u>[53,56]</u>\nIn diabetes, excessive mitochondrial ROS production has been implicated as a \"master switch\" for activation of discrete pathologic signaling pathways leading to subsequent endothelial dysfunction through protein kinase C activation, increased AGE formation, and increased polyol and hexosamine pathway flux.通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>In vivo, human studies found that hyperglycemia induces this endothelial dysfunction via excessive oxidative stress. The relationship between human endothelial dysfunction and alterations in endothelial and inflammatory cell mitochondrial homeostasis in diabetes is relatively unstudied. Some study findings suggest that altered mitochondrial homeostasis has an important pathophysiologic role in endothelial dysfunction in diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[78,79]</u>\nThere is growing recognition of a link between mitochondrial morphology and function.通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u> This link is apparent in diabetes and insulin resistance. These conditions are characterized by alterations in mitochondrial morphology, including smaller mitochondria with a less complicated structure and reduced capacity for oxidative phosphorylation, elevated mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced mitochondrial mass.通用删除6(英):<u>[81,82]</u> Microarray analyses of skeletal muscle from patients with diabetes reveal reduced expression of components of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. This change can be reversed by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha, which has an integral role in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u>In vitro cell culture and muscle biopsy results indicate decreased mitochondrial mass under hyperglycemic conditions, and this derangement is also present in offspring of patients with insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[79,81]</u>\nIn endothelial cells, hyperglycemia induces mitochondrial fission with subsequent development of excessive mitochondrial ROS production, reduced adenosine triphosphate production, and blunted cell growth.通用删除6(英):<u>[83]</u> Results from endothelial cell-culture indicate that exposure to high glucose concentrations increases endothelial ROS production. This phenomenon is primarily related to the increased mitochondrial ROS because blunting of the effect occurs only with pharmacologic inhibition of complex II, overexpression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1, or exposure to manganese SOD. Indicative of the cell-signaling capacity of mitochondrial ROS, mitochondrial ROS inhibitors also reduce NF-κB and protein kinase C activation and reduce the production of toxic AGE products and sorbitol.通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> Expression of cell-adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell surface depends on mitochondrial ROS when high glucose concentrations are present.通用删除6(英):<u>[79,84,85]</u> Exposure of endothelial cells to high concentrations of FFAs increases mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial ROS, and NF-κB in human aortic endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u> Each of these responses is inhibited by overexpression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Therefore, reductions in mitochondrial ROS, together with the reductions in mitochondrial membrane potential, are responsible for the observed improvement in endothelial function. Similarly, in intact vessels, overexpression of UCP2 in the rat aorta reverses endothelial dysfunction induced by lysophosphatidylcholine.通用删除6(英):<u>[32,86]</u>\nMitochondrial fission could be an effective target to improve diabetic endothelial function. Metformin reduces diabetes-accelerated development of atherosclerosis by inhibiting mitochondrial fission in endothelial cells. Metformin treatment significantly reduces streptozotocin-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, suppresses mitochondrial superoxide production, inhibits vascular inflammation, improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and inhibits atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice. In endothelial cells exposed to high glucose concentrations, metformin treatment suppresses mitochondrial superoxide production, reduces levels of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and its transport to mitochondria, and prevents mitochondrial fission.通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u>\nMitophagy is an important cytoprotective mechanism for limiting mitochondrial-derived oxidative stress and preventing apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[88]</u> However, excessive fission occurs under pathological conditions, especially in diabetes mellitus. This change negatively affects mitophagy and results in increased levels of mitochondrial fragmentation, ROS overproduction, and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria.通用删除6(英):<u>[89]</u> The increased ROS further accelerates mitochondrial oxidative damage and cytochrome C release to the cytosol, which amplifies apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u> Thus, targeting improvement in mitophagy may be a promising method of treatment for endothelial oxidative damage in diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[91]</u>\nDefense mechanisms in the form of antioxidants are present in the body to counteract oxidative stress. They include enzymes like SOD, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and the fat- (bilirubin, coenzyme Q, vitamin A, and vitamin E) and water-soluble (vitamin C and uric acid) antioxidants.通用删除6(英):<u>[92]</u> A general reduction in antioxidant defense mechanisms occurs in diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[51,53,56]</u> Low levels of serum carotenoid also play a role in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u> Antioxidant therapy achieved using supplementation with pharmaceutical preparations of antioxidant nutrients or non-nutrients,通用删除6(英):<u>[93,94]</u> or both, may confer cardiovascular and metabolic benefits in diabetes. Experimental findings indicate that antioxidants improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation and insulin sensitivity. Results of epidemiological studies indicate there are strong associations between dietary intake of antioxidant nutrients and protection against CVD.通用删除6(英):<u>[95,96,97]</u>\nHyperglycemia inhibits endothelial function in the forearm microvasculature via suppression of NO bioavailability.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> This reduced dilation during acute hyperglycemia is also found in patients with diabetes and can be improved using antioxidant therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[65,66,98]</u> NO has important antioxidant activities in the vessel wall, including direct scavenging of superoxide anions and inhibition of lipid peroxidation.通用删除6(英):<u>[99,100,101]</u> The efficiency of NO in its antioxidant role can make basal endothelium-dependent, NO-mediated vasodilator function especially vulnerable to inhibition during an oxidative insult. Conversely, loss of basal endothelium-derived NO in this manner can also help preserve vasodilator responses to endothelial agonists and NO donors. However, any lesion in the endogenous NO signaling pathway has major pathological implications for microangiographic disease progression in diabetes. Dysregulation of vascular tone, the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, platelet aggregation, coagulation, fibrinolysis, leukocyte adhesion, vascular permeability, and lipoprotein oxidation contribute to the progression of the disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[98]</u> Many of these pro-atherogenic sequelae can be triggered by hyperglycemia via formation of AGE, which inactivates NO to generate endothelial intracellular oxidant stress.通用删除6(英):<u>[79,98,102,103]</u>\nStudy results suggest that diminution of endothelial synthesis of NO contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> In addition to detracting from the vascular antioxidant defense, this change compounds any defect in the anti-atherogenic signaling role of NO.通用删除6(英):<u>[67,104]</u> The 3 isoforms of NOS (eNOS, neuronal NOS, and inducible NOS) require 5 cofactors/prosthetic groups (flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, heme, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin, and Ca-calmodulin) to convert L-arginine to NO. If NOS lacks any of the cofactors or substrates, it will switch from the coupled state of NO production to the uncoupled state of O2⋅- production.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> The resulting O2⋅- reacts with the preformed NO to form ONOO-, which is an extremely potent oxidizing agent. Peroxynitrite, in turn, can oxidize the cofactor of eNOS and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin to 7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin, thus further uncouple NO generation.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> The increased pro-oxidant activity can facilitate oxidation of LDL to oxLDL particles, which can limit the availability of L-arginine, enhance the uncoupling of NOS, and contribute to increased ROS generation and decreased availability of NO in diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[54,56]</u> ONOO--mediated tyrosine nitration of prostacyclin synthase contributes to vascular complications in diabetes mellitus. In diabetes, hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia increases O2⋅- and ONOO- generation, which results in prostacyclin synthase nitration and subsequent thromboxane receptor stimulation. ONOO- also promotes endothelium-derived cyclooxygenase-dependent vasoconstriction factor release via accumulation of non-metabolized prostaglandin H2. Thus, ONOO--dependent prostacyclin synthase nitration shifts the balance toward platelet aggregation, atheroma, and thrombus formation.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>\nResults of studies performed by us通用删除6(英):<u>[105,106]</u> and others通用删除6(英):<u>[107]</u> suggest that 3 correlated mechanisms are involved in the regulation of eNOS uncoupling via O2⋅- and then ONOO- in diabetes. They include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> oxidative modification of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) into dihydrobiopterin; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> regulation of the zinc-thiolate center of eNOS, leading to zinc-depleted eNOS dimers and reduction of affinity to BH4 and L-arginine; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1, a rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 synthesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> We found that O2⋅- generated from hyperglycemia can quench NO to form ONOO-, a powerful oxidant that not only causes prostacyclin synthase nitration and thromboxane receptor activation but also uncouples eNOS to produce oxidants.通用删除6(英):<u>[105,108]</u>\nThe heterotrimer AMPK comprises α, β, and γ subunits. Each subunit has at least 2 isoforms.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,11,12]</u> The α subunit contains the catalytic site. Increases in the Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio activate AMPK via mechanisms including direct allosteric activation and phosphorylation of the α subunit at Thr-172 by an AMP-dependent AMPK kinase (AMPKK).通用删除6(英):<u>[109]</u> Until 2013, AMPKK was thought to be activated by an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. However, study results indicate that AMP binding to AMPK makes it more susceptible to phosphorylation by AMPKK.通用删除6(英):<u>[110,111,112]</u> Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) was the first AMPKK identified.通用删除6(英):<u>[110,111,112,113]</u> A gene mutation in this tumor suppressor increases the risk of colon, stomach, and pancreatic cancer (Peutz-Jegher syndrome). Calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase was the second AMPKK identified.通用删除6(英):<u>[114,115]</u>\nAMPK is activated in response to stresses such as hypoxia, oxidant stress, hyperosmolarity, and exercise (in muscle). Other studies indicate that AMPK activation is a fundamental component of cellular responses to stress that threaten viability.通用删除6(英):<u>[116,117,118]</u> AMPK can be phosphorylated and activated in various tissues by hormones acting through Gq receptors,通用删除6(英):<u>[113]</u> adiponectin,通用删除6(英):<u>[116,117]</u> leptin,通用删除6(英):<u>[118,119]</u> α and β-adrenoreceptor agonists,通用删除6(英):<u>[120]</u> metformin,通用删除6(英):<u>[121,122,123]</u> the thiazolidinediones,通用删除6(英):<u>[124]</u> and oxidants such as ONOO-通用删除6(英):<u>[125]</u> and hydrogen peroxide.通用删除6(英):<u>[126]</u> AMPK activation results in phosphorylation of target molecules to increase fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose transportation; it also inhibits synthetic processes to conserve ATP.通用删除6(英):<u>[118]</u> Acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase were the first identified AMPK targets. Other AMPK targets are being identified at a rapid rate. AMPK inhibits proliferation through multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms include cell cycle regulation, inhibition of protein synthesis, and de novo synthesis of fatty acids, particularly mevalonate and its downstream products during cholesterol synthesis. Dual deficiency of AMPK α1 and α2, 2 catalytic subunits of AMPK, is lethal to mouse embryos, which indicates the importance of AMPK.通用删除6(英):<u>[127]</u>\nCompared with AMPKα2, AMPKα1 is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[128]</u> However, both isoforms might have equal roles in the maintenance of endothelial function. In endothelial cells, the activity of AMPK can be regulated by stimuli that affect cellular ATP levels (eg, hypoxia) and by fluid shear stress, Ca2+-elevating agonists, and hormones such as adiponectin. The AMPK in endothelial cells is implicated in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation, small G protein activity, NO production, inflammation, and angiogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[129]</u> AMPKα1通用删除6(英):<u>[125,130,131]</u> and α2通用删除6(英):<u>[132]</u> increase NO release by phosphorylating both Ser1177 and Ser635 of eNOS in endothelial cells. Selective deletion of endothelial PRKAA1 coding for protein kinase AMPKα1 reduces glycolysis, compromises endothelial cell proliferation, and accelerates the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in hyperlipidemic mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[128]</u> Endothelial-specific deletion of the AMPKα1 subunit attenuates phenylephrine-mediated contraction in an eNOS- and endothelium-dependent manner.通用删除6(英):<u>[133]</u> AMPKα2-/- mice have impairment of acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, along with increased oxidant production.通用删除6(英):<u>[134]</u>\nAMPK is dysregulated in animals and humans with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.通用删除6(英):<u>[135]</u> AMPK activation via physiological or pharmacological means can improve the sensitivity of insulin and metabolic hemostasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[136]</u> Various hormones, natural compounds, and pharmacological agents can activate AMPK. Some, like metformin and thiazolidinediones, are used to treat type 2 diabetes. Metformin is also used off-label to limit the insulin dose requirement during treatment of type 1 diabetes. Results of REducing with MetfOrmin Vascular Adverse Lesions (REMOVAL) trial indicate that metformin treatment in type 1 diabetes can alleviate atherosclerosis progression and reduce LDL-cholesterol levels and body weight.通用删除6(英):<u>[137]</u> These findings suggest a new perspective on the therapeutic activation of AMPK in type 1 diabetes and indicate a potential role in the reduction of long-term CVD risk.通用删除6(英):<u>[137]</u> For instance, chicoric acid is likely to protect against diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction via the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway.通用删除6(英):<u>[138]</u> AMPK is an important candidate for the effective treatment of the diabetes-associated vascular endothelial injury.\nHyperglycemia is the core determinant of long-term complications in diabetes, mainly via induction of oxidative stress. Ido et al通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> found that incubation with the first direct AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), completely prevents hyperglycemia-drive oxidative stress and apoptosis. This result suggests that AMPK has a protective role against damage in endothelial cells resulting from sustained hyperglycemia. NOX is the major source of high glucose-induced oxidative stress.通用删除6(英):<u>[139]</u> Study results indicate that AMPK activation functions as a NOX inhibitory mechanism via regulation of NOX complex assembly or NOX subunit expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[140]</u> For instance, AMPK inhibits activation of NOX in human neutrophils. Treatment of neutrophils with AICAR or AMP suppresses the rise in O2⋅- production triggered by phorbol esters or N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine.通用删除6(英):<u>[141]</u> AMPK activity prevents the serine phosphorylation and membrane translocation of p47phox induced by these agonists. A widely used antidiabetic drug, metformin, inhibits O2⋅- production by stimulated neutrophils,通用删除6(英):<u>[142]</u> and in platelets.通用删除6(英):<u>[143]</u> Genetic deletion of AMPKα2 in LDL receptor-knockout LDLr-/- mice significantly increases 26S proteasome activity, I-κB degradation, NF-κB transactivation, NOX subunit expression, ROS production, and endothelial dysfunction.通用删除6(英):<u>[134]</u> All these effects are markedly suppressed by long administration of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132.通用删除6(英):<u>[134]</u> These findings suggest that AMPKα2 is a physiological inhibitor of NOX in endothelial cells. As a result, AMPK is essential in maintaining the non-atherogenic and non-inflammatory conditions in endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[134]</u> Rosiglitazone activates AMPK in endothelial cells which, in turn, prevents hyperactivity of NOX induced by high glucose, possibly through protein kinase C inhibition.通用删除6(英):<u>[139]</u> Taken together, these results suggest that AMPK functions as an \"early warning system\" in response to oxidant stress and upon activation, AMPK can suppress oxidative injury by suppressing NOX-derived ROS. This feedback mechanism becomes impaired in diabetes, and AMPK inhibition accentuates oxidative stress and vascular injury in diabetes in vivo.\nMitochondrial ROS levels increase in response to many atherosclerosis-associated stimuli, including hyperglycemia, oxLDL, and triglycerides.通用删除6(英):<u>[144,145,146]</u> Pharmacological activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide or salicylate restores mitochondrial morphology and relieves endothelial dysfunction via suppression of mitochondrial ROS, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and subsequent activation of inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[147]</u> AMPK regulates mitochondrial fission via autophagy-dependent degradation of DRP1 in endothelial cells. Deletion of AMPKα1 or AMPKα2 results in defective autophagy, DRP1 accumulation, and aberrant mitochondrial fragmentation in the mouse aortic endothelium.通用删除6(英):<u>[148]</u> Metformin administration markedly inhibits mitochondrial fragmentation, decreases mitochondrial-induced superoxide, improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation, suppresses vascular inflammation, and alleviates atherosclerotic lesions in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Another study found that metformin attenuates the development of atherosclerosis by reducing DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial superoxide anion production in an AMPK-dependent manner.通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u> Taken together, these findings suggest that suppression of mitochondrial fission is a potentially effective therapeutic approach for treating macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes. C-peptide prevents diabetic vasculopathy by suppressing ROS-mediated endothelial cell apoptosis. C-peptide activates AMPKα and inhibits high glucose-induced ROS generation, mitochondrial fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane potential decline, and endothelial cell apoptosis. C-peptide replacement therapy restores AMPKα phosphorylation, ROS generation, and mitochondrial morphology in aortas of diabetic mice. These findings reveal a novel mechanism that is associated with the use of C-peptide to activate AMPKα and alleviate hyperglycemia-induced vasculopathy.通用删除6(英):<u>[149]</u>\nContinuously produced ROS can be eliminated by antioxidant systems. AMPK activation can suppress diabetic endothelial dysfunction by upregulating antioxidant potentials. Pharmacological AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside can markedly increase UCP-2 expression and decrease O2⋅-production and prostacyclin synthase nitration in diabetic wildtype mice but not in AMPKα2-KO counterparts.通用删除6(英):<u>[150]</u> Direct evidence indicates that AMPK activation suppresses hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial ROS generation via induction of manganese SOD and promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis through the AMPK-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[151]</u>\nTaken together, we conclude that AMPK functions as oxidant stress suppressor or redox modulator as its activation can trigger physiological responses to suppress the processes that generate oxidants (mitochondria, NOX) and/or to increase antioxidant defense systems 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nA line of evidence supports the responsiveness of AMPK in control of imbalanced redox status.通用删除6(英):<u>[126,152,153,154]</u> For instance, the addition of the vitamin E analog and antioxidant, Trolox, to mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in reduced basal AMPK activity.通用删除6(英):<u>[155]</u> Hydrogen peroxide activates AMPK in various cell types.通用删除6(英):<u>[156]</u> ROS-triggered energy stress strongly activates AMPK and is likely to be the major mechanism of ROS-caused AMPK activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[157,158]</u> Alternatively, 1 study found that ROS can directly activate AMPK; this effect is independent of the changes in AMP, adenosine diphosphate, and ATP.通用删除6(英):<u>[154]</u> Glucose oxidase-generated hydrogen peroxide also contributes to AMPK activation through direct S-glutathionylation on the AMPKα subunit at residues Cys299 and Cys304.通用删除6(英):<u>[159]</u> Reactive nitrogen species are also implicated in AMPK activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[156]</u> Subsequent studies from us have further determined that AMPK acts as a proximal \"oxidant sensor\" within endothelial cells, either through its ability to respond to minimal changes in AMP levels or through its activation by oxidant-initiated signaling events 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>\nStudy findings support a role for ROS in the impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation found in various vascular preparations isolated from experimental diabetic animals.通用删除6(英):<u>[160,161,162,163,164,165]</u> It is likely that this dysfunction is mainly due to the reduced bioavailability of NO resulting from its rapid inactivation by superoxide radicals.通用删除6(英):<u>[166,167]</u> This mechanism, together with the production of superoxide anion by \"uncoupled\" NOS, may generate significant sources of endothelial superoxide anion.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u> AMPK contribution to eNOS bioactivity is supported by in vitro and in vivo work by our group and others.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> In addition to direct phosphorylation of eNOS to increase NO production, AMPK can promote NO bioactivity by suppressing NO inactivation via reduction of the amount of ROS in the diseased vessel. Non-toxic levels of ROS/ONOO- activate AMPK or AMPK-dependent pathways,通用删除6(英):<u>[13,125,168,169,170,171,172]</u> while activation of AMPK suppresses ROS/ONOO- generation.\nAMPK activity decreases in muscle in multiple animal models with a metabolic syndrome phenotype.通用删除6(英):<u>[173]</u> Evidence indicates that AMPK activity is diminished in adipose tissue通用删除6(英):<u>[174]</u> and skeletal muscle通用删除6(英):<u>[175]</u> of humans with obesity or type 2 diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[135]</u> Decreased AMPK activity and subsequent reduction in cardiac autophagy are important events during the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Chronic activation of AMPK by metformin prevents cardiomyopathy by upregulating autophagy activity in diabetic OVE26 mice. This finding suggests that stimulation of AMPK represents a novel approach for treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy.通用删除6(英):<u>[176]</u> Hyperglycemia impairs autophagy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells via inhibition of AMPK, which directly results in endothelial cell damage.通用删除6(英):<u>[177]</u> Diabetes downregulates AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in mouse aortas. This downregulation can be suppressed by metformin treatment. Similar results are found in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u> Endothelial dysfunction caused by a high fat diet is related to a dysfunctional endothelial AMPK-phosphoinositide 3-kinases-protein kinase B-eNOS pathway. The dysfunction correlates with increases in plasma non-esterified fatty acids, triglyceride, and impaired glucose management.通用删除6(英):<u>[178]</u>\nROS and other reactive molecules can inhibit the LKB-AMPK axis.通用删除6(英):<u>[179,180]</u> For instance, chemically reactive lipids, such as cyclopentenone prostaglandins (exogenous or generated from cyclooxygenase-2) form a covalent adduct with LKB1 Cys210 in its activation loop and thus inhibit LKB1 kinase activity.通用删除6(英):<u>[179]</u> Similarly, findings from a study using a spontaneously hypertensive rat model indicate that the development of left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the oxidative stress-derived lipid peroxidation byproduct 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal.通用删除6(英):<u>[180]</u> This increase results in the formation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-LKB1 adducts that inhibit LKB1 and subsequent AMPK activity.通用删除6(英):<u>[180]</u> However, these two studies did not describe any direct post-translational modification of AMPK by ROS. In conditions of glucose starvation or exogenous hydrogen peroxide treatment, AMPK is negatively regulated by oxidation of cysteine residues Cys130 and Cys174 on its α subunit. The changes cause oxidative aggregation and interfere with the interaction between LKB1 and AMPK.通用删除6(英):<u>[181,182]</u>\nOur unpublished results indicate that in chronic diseases such as diabetes, AMPK becomes a target of excessive oxidative stress. We found that: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> When given exogenously or when produced in the vasculature from endogenous sources, ONOO- inhibits AMPK activation likely by increasing tyrosine nitration of AMPK. The catalytic activities of AMPKα are exquisitely and uniquely sensitive to pathologically relevant concentrations of ONOO-; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Chronic exposure of endothelial cells to elevated glucose concentrations results in loss of AMPK, aberrant overexpression of NOX activity, and increased O2⋅- release similar to that seen with genetic depletion of AMPK. The effects of elevated glucose are prevented by superoxide dismutase-polyethylene glycol or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME); these findings indicate that endogenous generation of ONOO- is responsible for the AMPK loss; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Direct demonstration of the occurrence of AMPK nitration in endothelial cells exposed to hyperglycemia and in tissues from diabetic mice. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that AMPK is inhibited by pathologically relevant concentrations of ONOO- generated in a diabetic milieu.\nEndothelial dysfunction is the earliest detectable pathological event in diabetes. Glucose levels elevated via the increased production of free radicals and oxidants are likely to be the main causes of endothelial dysfunction. Our work has firmly established that AMPK in endothelial cells is activated by very low levels of free radicals and oxidants; activation of AMPK by low levels of oxidants can feedback to the suppression of oxidant stress, either via its suppression on multiple sources (NOX, mitochondria, etc) and/or the promotion of antioxidant enzyme levels within endothelial cells. As a result, AMPK reverses or prevents endothelial dysfunction caused by diabetes, and aberrant oxidant stress-induced AMPK inactivation accelerates both endothelial dysfunction and CVD in diabetes. Based on these observations, we propose that besides the traditional ATP/ADP/AMPK regulation pathway and traditional roles of AMPK in energy metabolism, AMPK is the main sensor in redox homeostasis and is critical for maintaining redox homeostasis by suppressing the levels of oxidant stress 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>.\nIn summary, we conclude that AMPK inactivation caused by aberrant oxidant stress plays a crucial role in endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. Selective AMPK activation can effectively treat endothelial dysfunction in diabetes by normalizing the critical roles of AMPK for maintenance of endothelial cell redox homeostasis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

Over the past decades, dramatic improvements have been made in the treatment of and the final clinical outcomes for this highly aggressive disease. The concept of administering chemotherapy before definitive surgery on the primary tumor was first introduced by Rosen et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> Since then, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) with folinic acid (leucovorin) rescue is still the gold standard therapy in the treatment of osteosarcoma. Today, with the combination of preoperative or \"neoadjuvant\" chemotherapy including HD-MTX, cisplatin, ifosfamide or doxorubicin and radical surgery, disease-free survival rates of ≤70% can be achieved.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\nThere is a close relationship between MTX concentration, adverse reaction and treatment effect, with large individual differences. The incidence of toxicity has decreased as a result of plasma MTX concentration monitoring and appropriate leucovorin rescue, combined with adequate hydration and urine alkalinization. Effective concentration of MTX in the blood can significantly increase the clinical tumor necrosis rate.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u> Recent studies have reported that a serum MTX concentration of 1000 µmol/L after a 4 h infusion and 700 µmol/L after a 6 h infusion can achieve good efficacy in the treatment of osteosarcoma. However, the higher the concentration of MTX is, the more side effects it will cause. The safe range for the area under the curve has been found to be between 4000 mM/h and 12,000 mM/h.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>\nTherefore, it is important to obtain the individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. The scattered serum drug concentration of MTX and the estimated population pharmacokinetics (PPK) parameters were analyzed in the present study using the nonlinear mixed effect model (NON-MEM), the established PPK model employed for Chinese patients with osteosarcoma, and used to help obtain the final PPK model. We also examined the effects of some covariates (including height, body weight and other factors) on the PPK parameters and hence that our study could provide evidence for clinically personalized medication. In a further step, its implementation in the TDM software (Vital Scientific N.V.) that is most commonly used in the clinical setting might help optimize MTX dosing in patients with osteosarcoma and consequently, improve clinical outcome. Moreover, PPK models can also account for both the PK between-subject and between-occasion variability, allowing individual tailoring of the optimal dose.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u>\nThe goals of the present study were: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> To establish the PPK of HD-MTX treatment in Chinese osteosarcoma patients; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> to explore the influence of patient covariates and between-occasion variability on drug disposition.\nThis study included 148 patients with osteosarcoma, who had received HD-MTX treatment for a total of 274 times (194 for males and 80 for females) from August 2009 to August 2010 in our department. Patients had the following characteristics: Age, 17.00 ± 7.06 years; height, 166.00 ± 12.44 cm; body weight, 58.00 ± 18.28 kg; and body surface area, 1.63 ± 0.27 m2.\nIn the first phase (hyperhydration and urine alkalinization) a 500 ml 5% glucose injection (GDD) + a 500 ml 5% glucose and sodium chloride (GNS) injection + 10 ml of 15% KCL; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> 200 ml 5% NaHCO3 was given at 12 h before MTX infusion.\nThe second phase (MTX infusion) consisted of seven groups of drugs that were consecutively administered: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> 500 ml 5% GDD + 500 ml 5% GNS + 10 ml 15% KCL; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> 100 ml 5% NaHCO3; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> 2 mg vincristine + 10 ml 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl); 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> 500 ml 5% GDD + 8–12 g/m2 MTX for 4–6 h in darkness; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> 1000 ml 5% GDD; 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> 1000 ml 5% GNS + 10 ml 15% KCL; 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> 200 ml 5% NaHCO3; 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u> 100 ml 0.9% NaCl + 5 mg3 Tropisetron.\nIn the third phase (hyperhydration and urine alkalinization) the following compounds were administered: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> 100 ml 0.9% NaCl + 5 mg Tropisetron; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> 1000 ml 5% GDD; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> 1000 ml 5% GNS + 10 ml 15% KCL; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> 200 ml 5% NaHCO3.\nDuring chemotherapy, 1.0 tid NaHCO3 and 200 mg tid allopurinol was taken orally daily. Urine volume was recorded over a 24 h period, and urinary pH between 7 and 9 was monitored.\nAt 6–8 h after the end of MTX infusion 12 mg q6h leucovorin cystic fibrosis (CF) rescue was given until the serum concentration of MTX was reduced to 0.05 µmol/L. If delayed excretion occurred, the dose of CF was increased according to the standard.\nTwo mililitre of blood was drawn from the lateral vein at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after MTX infusion. If the drug concentration in the blood was >0.05 µmol/L after 72 h, 2 ml of blood was continuously drawn every 24 h until the concentration was <0.05 µmol/L.\nBlood samples were centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min at room temperature in tubes without anticoagulant. MTX concentration was measured using fluorescence polarization immunoassay (TDX, ABBOTT, USA) with a quantification limit of 0.01 µmol/L. The recovery rate of high-, medium- and low-quality control samples was 90–110%. The interday precision was <10%.\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using the nonlinear mixed effects model (NONMEM, Version V, Level 1.1: GloboMax, USA). A two-compartment model was established for data fitting. The nonlinear least squares principle was applied to find a group of PPK parameters to minimize the value of the objective function (OFV). The values of the OFV among the similar models approximately followed a χ2 distribution: When df = 1, χ20.05, 1 = 3.84, χ20.001 , 1= 10.83. When the parameter numbers between two models differed by 1, if ΔOFV >3.84, there was a significant difference (P < 0.05); if ΔOFV >10.83, there was a highly significant difference (P < 0.001).\nStatistical model: Pi j= PTV j⋅Exp(ηi j)\nwhere Pij is the ith individual’s jth PK parameters, PTVj is the typical group value of the jth PK parameters, and ɳij represents the inter-individual random error of the individual parameter Pij to the group parameter PTVj. The values of ɳij followed the normal distribution, zero in the center with a variance of ω2.\nResidual random effect model: CObs = CPred ⋅ (1 + ε1) + ε2 where and CObs and CPred are the actual observed value and the predicted value, respectively. ε1 and ε2 are inter-individual/inter-experiment random errors, which follow the normal distribution: Zero in the center with a variance of σ12 and σ22.ε1 represents the proportional error and ε2 represents the additive error.\nFixed effect model:\nwhere PTVij is the typical individual value of the ith individual’s jth PK parameter, PTVj is the typical group value of the jth PK parameter, and COVRik and  are the ith individual’s kth covariate and its mean, respectively. θjk represents the degree of deviation of the individual parameter from its typical group value when the individual covariate differs from its mean by one unit.\nThe sample volume independent effect size (ES, statistical effect) was used as the test indicator for the biochemical index collected from the modeling process.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> An ES between 0.2 and 0.8 was considered as a medium effect, and a median of 0.5 was used here as the critical value. The physiological indexes before and after drug administration were considered as being changed when the ES was >0.5, and were then excluded as covariates.\nWhere Sd is the combined standard deviation. The equation used to calculate the Sd was , where the upper line represents the average value, and S is the standard deviation.\nThe extent of correlation among every element could be visualized using the diagram of covariants created using the R software version 2.12.0 for Windows (Mathsoft, Halethorpe, MD, USA).\nThe full regression model was established using the stepwise regression method. If the OFV decreased by >3.84, the covariate had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on this model, and this covariate should be retained in the model. All covariates with no significant effect were excluded. The full model was obtained after all covariates that had a significant effect were added in.\nAll covariates involved in the full regression model were tested using a more rigorous statistical standard (when df = 1, χ20.001, 1 = 10.83). If a change in the OFV was >10.83, the covariates were considered to have a significant effect and were retained in the model. Otherwise, the covariates were removed from the model. The final model was obtained through reverse elimination of the full regression model.\nThe drug serum concentration-time curve is shown in Figure 1. There were 148 patients with osteosarcoma, who received HD-MTX treatment a total of 274 times. The plot indicated a two-compartment model, and NONMEM, first-order conditional estimation was applied for fitting; the PK of the two-compartment model (OFV) was 487.856.\nA summary of the selected covariates is given in Table 1. They were: Number of chemotherapy (NUM) cycles; number of methotrexate chemotherapy (MTXNUM) cycles; Volume 1, the volume of infusion 1 day before drug administration (ml); pH 1, pH 1 day before drug administration; T1, body temperature 1 day before drug administration; U1, urine volume 1 day before drug administration (ml).\nCovariates investigated during the modeling process\n删除重复语句：<u>Covariates investigated during the modeling process</u>\nNumber: Number of chemotherapy cycles; Gender: Sex; BMI: Body mass index; Volume1: The amount of fluid the day before administration; MTXNUM: Number of MTX chemotherapy cycles; BODYAREA: Body surface area; CrCl1: Creatinine clearance before administration; PH1: Urinary pH before dosing day; RBC1: Erythrocyte count before administration; HCT1: Hematocrit level before administration; Cr1: Serum creatinine level before administration; AKP1: Alkaline phosphatase before administration; T1: Temperature before administration; Total protein1: Total protein level before administration; Albumin1: Albumin level before administration; Na1: Serum sodium level; Cl1: Serum chloride; U1: Urine volume before administration; RBC: Red blood cell; NA: Not available.\nIn addition, we explored the correlation between these covariates. We found that the covariates with a strong correlation included MTXNUM and NUM 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. Additionally, the three covariates–weight, body mass index (BMI) and body area—were strongly correlated with each other. In the process of modeling, special attention needed to be given to the covariates with strong correlation, and the factors with a significant effect should be selected rather than non-significant ones to prevent the development of an over-complicated model.\nThe final model of the MTX PPK established using the NONMEM was as follows:\nwhere CL1, V1, CL2 and V2 are the individual central compartment clearance rate, the central compartment distribution volume, the peripheral compartment clearance rate and the peripheral compartment distribution volume in the population, respectively. η is the inter-individual variation among the various parameters. MTXNUM was the time of chemotherapy using MTX before chemotherapy, body area is the body surface area, and Cr is the serum creatinine clearance rate. The PKs parameters of the basic model and final model are listed in Table 2.\nEstimates of pharmacokinetic parameters regarding the base and final model\n删除重复语句：<u>Estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters regarding the base and final model</u>\nCL1: Clearance of the central compartment; V1: The apparent distribution volume of the central compartment; CL2: Clearance of the peripheral compartment; V2: The apparent distribution volume of the peripheral compartment; θCL1−MTXNUM: The correction factor for MTXNUM regarding the parameter CL1; θCL1−CrCl: The correction factor of CrCl1 regarding the parameter CL1; θCL2−BODYARE: The correction factor for BODYAREA regarding the parameter CL2; θV2−BODYARE: The correction factor for BODYAREA regarding the parameter V2; PPK: Population pharmacokinetics; RSE: Relative standard error; RSD: Relative standard deviation.\nThis model was validated using the Bootstrap method.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Sampling was normally repeated 200–1000 times, building 200–1000 random sets of validation data. It was reported in the literature that the error would be <5% if the sampling frequency was >50.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> In our study, sampling was carried out 1000 times for validation of the final distribution 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>.\nThe goodness of fit between the predicted and observed values of serum drug concentration could be evaluated overall by plotting these two values against time. The half-logarithm coordinate diagram of the observed value, population predicted value, individual predicted value and time is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the basic model while Figure 4b shows the final model; the population predicted values from final model were closer to the observed values than was the case for the basic model, indicating that final model was an improvement on the basic model.\nWe could observe the quality of the curve fitting approximately by plotting the predicted values (individual, group) as abscissa and observed values as vertical coordinates. The fitting quality was better when the data points were uniformly distributed on both sides of the line with a zero intercept and a slope of 1. The closer to the line the data points were, the better the precision of their fitting. The relationship between the population predicted value, the individual predicted value and the observed value are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a shows the basic model and Figure 5b shows the final model; 1 was the population predicted value and 2 was individual predicted value. It was found that the individual predicted value was better fitted than the population predicted value in both the basic model and the final model. In addition, the final model proved to be better than the basic model.\nThe variance in weighted residual (WRES) under different concentrations could be estimated by plotting the population predicted value as abscissa and the WRES as vertical coordinates. The WRES made it easier to compare the results from different models. With better fitting, data points should be randomly and uniformly distributed on both sides of the zero line (−4, 4). The correlation between the WRES and the population predicted value is shown in Figure 6, where Figure 6a shows the basic model and Figure 6b shows the final model. A portion of the WRESs was beyond the − 4–4 range, with a few >20. When compared with the distribution of WRES in the basic model, the WRES values in the final model were more uniformly distributed, which was an improvement to a certain extent.\nResiduals (RES) and WRES were plotted against time to determine their change over time. In a better fitting model, all the data points should be uniformly distributed on both sides of line zero. The correlation between RES and time is shown in Figure 7, and between WRES and time in Figure 8, where A is the basic model and B is the final model in both figures.\nThe PPK model of high-dose MTX in osteosarcoma patients was established in the present study. In the final model, OFV was 373.294, a decrease of 114.562 when compared to the initial model, indicating a significant improvement. In addition, this model provided a very good fit for the predicted and observed concentrations with the exception of C0 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>. The RSEs% of two variables were greater than 30%, but were still acceptable. In addition, the calculated results were verified by means of Bootstrap and thus were reliable with a small RSE%.\nPopulation pharmacokinetics studies outside of China regarding MTX are currently focused on blood tumors; there have been two PPK studies on osteosarcoma. One involving adult patients, concluded that the three-compartment model provided a good fit.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> The parameter estimates for the final model were CL1 = 6.57 L/h and V1 = 42 L. In our study, CL1 = 6.20 L/h and V1 = 19.6 L. The difference in V1 between the two studies may be related to the age of the patients. The average age in the previous study通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> was 26.7 years, while the average age in our study was 17 years. In another PPK study of MTX in osteosarcoma patients at average age of 15 years,通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> the obtained parameter values were CL1 = 4.79 L/h, V1 = 16.7 L, CL2 = 0.019 L/h and V2 = 0.464 L, close to those obtained in the present study. In previously reported studies, the Bayesian approach has been proposed to analyze the PK of HD-MTX for individual dose adjustment. The PK parameters were estimated by several methods, including the Iterative Bayesian algorithm (IT2B37) and Non-parametric Em algorithm (NPEM38), assuming a 2-compartment PK model. In comparison with the result from a traditional PK study using Bayesian Estimation,通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> we achieved a very similar result in the estimation of CL (7.11 ± 3.20 L/h) and V1 (18.24 ± 9.87 L), partially because both populations are fairly young. But besides that, we can see they have a huge RSE%, around 50%, and in our study it’s usually within 10%. One reason is that we have more data, and thus more confidence, but more importantly, using the PPK method we can control for differences in other variables like CrCl1 and MTXNUM, further reducing potential variance. In the study, the value of 19.6 L is consistent with results reported by Rousseau et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> and Aquerreta et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> in children. In addition, intercompartmental clearance (0.0172 L/h) and peripheral distribution volume (0.515 L) values were in the same range as those previously published by Aquerreta et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> (CLD1 0.053 L/h, V2 1.82 L).\nDosing regimens differed depending on the disease; therefore, the differing degrees of hydration and administration times significantly affected the PK parameters. Each added covariate had physiological significance and was examined by forward selection and backward elimination tests. Many studies have reported that the MTX clearance is influenced by the clearance rate of serum creatinine or creatinine.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> The duration of chemotherapy was also an effect concerning the clinic. Osteosarcoma chemotherapy involves 4–6 h infusion of high-dose (8–12 g/m2) sequential therapy. The preoperative treatment consists of four cycles, and the postoperative treatment consists of 12–16 cycles. Thus, the number of chemotherapy cycles using this method is many times greater than using general MTX chemotherapy. Therefore, the ability of the surrounding room clearance was affected. It has been found in several previous cases that the concentration of MTX remained high during chemotherapy after many cycles of chemotherapy. This could be due to the fact that repeated chemotherapy can impair renal function leading to MTX damage to liver cells as a result of the decreased rate of clearance. Body surface area was also a very important reference index for MTX treatment. The recommended measurement of the MTX dose was generally in g/m2. Therefore, when using the body surface area calculation it is necessary to pay attention to special patient populations such as amputees, or patients who experience severe weight loss after multiple chemotherapy cycles.\nOther covariates reported in literature include hydration通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> and the pH of urine.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> However, these two covariates had no significant effect in our model; the reason for urine pH having no significant effect was possibly the result of poor recording, because patients self-measured the pH using pH test paper, with a precision of only one digit and the frequent appearance of recordings of 7–8 or 6–9. Regarding hydration, different doses of drug were administered in the present study as compared with other previous studies. Moreover, it has been reported通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> that differences in serum drug concentration were not detectable at high infusion volume, which might have also happened in our study.\nThere were some patients who received HD-MTX multiple times, and we treated them as totally separate individuals in the modeling process to gather more data, but that also meant that we ignored the internal correlation within patients. This may partially explain the existing difference.\nThrough the analysis of the data from 274 cases with high-dose MTX chemotherapy, we considered that the PK characteristics followed the two-compartment model; the elimination of MTX was influenced by the timing of MTX chemotherapy, the clearance rate of creatinine and body surface area. The clearance rate of MTX decreased with increased times of MTX chemotherapy or a decreased creatinine clearance rate, while body surface area had a positive correlation with the peripheral clearance rate and the apparent volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. The results indicate that it is important to strengthen the pharmaceutical care of patients receiving multiple MTX chemotherapy treatments, paying attention to the dosage calculations in amputee patients and obtaining renal creatinine clearance data prior to chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to improve the clinical effectiveness of chemotherapy and reduce the serious risks associated with this treatment. The findings provide an important theoretical basis for the proposed clinical MTX chemotherapy and the critical monitoring points for reducing the risks. An in-depth PPK study of individual doses should be undertaken in the future in a large osteosarcoma patient population involving HD-MTX to develop software for individualized dose calculation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}

To improve the accuracy and sensitivity of intraoperative neuromonitoring, combined monitoring of transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potentials (TES-MEPs), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) was attempted in microsurgery for lesions adjacent to the brainstem and intracranial aneurysms.Methods Monitoring of combined TES-MEPs with SSEPs was attempted in 68 consecutive patients with lesions adjacent to the brainstem as well as intracranial aneurysms. Among them, 31 patients (31 operations, 28 of posterior cranial fossa tumors, 3 of posterior circulation aneurysms) were also subjected to monitoring of BAEPs. The correlation of monitoring results and clinical outcome was studied prospectively.Results Combined monitoring of evoked potentials (EPs) was done in 64 (94.1%) of the 68 patients. MEPs monitoring was impossible for 4 patients (5.9%). No complication was observed during the combined monitoring in all the patients. In 45 (66.2%) of the 68 patients, EPs were stable, and they were neurologically intact. Motor dysfunction was detected by MEPs in 8 patients, SSEPs in 5, and BAEPs in 4, respectively.Conclusions A close relationship exists between postoperative motor function and the results of TES-MEPs monitoring.TES-MEPs are superior to SSEPs and BAEPs in detecting motor dysfunction, but combined EPs serve as a safe,effective and invasive method for intraoperative monitoring of the function of the motor nervous system. Monitoring of combined EPs during microsurgery for lesions adjacent to the brainstem and intracranial aneurysms may detect potentially hazardous maneuvers and improve the safety of subsequent procedures。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}
